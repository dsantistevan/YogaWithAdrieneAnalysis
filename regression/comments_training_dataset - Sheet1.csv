8,"I am on Day 9 of 30 Days of Yoga! I am more than happy that I started this journey and more than thankful that you take the time to offer your videos to the public. In this short amount of time, I have already began integrating yoga into my day with easy effort. For awhile, it was hard for me to come to my mat. Last year, I started yoga in the late summer because I get terrible tension headaches from sitting at a desk all day! But in October, I had to have a small lump removed from my breast (no big deal, just hormonal!) and I couldn't practice for over a month. I sat and meditated but eventually the busy holiday season came around and I started neglecting myself. BUT last month, my sister noticed my struggle and she suggested your videos :) Your email is such a blessing in my inbox!! I get so excited to practice with you and it didn't take long for me to find out that yoga is a priority for me, not an option. THANK YOU SO MUCH ADRIENE! ¬†Your flows are amazing and I love how you joke and kid, it makes the experience all the more enjoyable. I adore you :) Lots of 3> from a former Texan, currently in Colorado.",0.9987825751,0.60,0.80,0.00,0.70,0.80,0.00,0.00,0.60,1125,D

I started doing yoga first and foremost to feel better physically since I've stopped other excersices and sports because of plenty of reasons and I have some pain and I feel that doing yoga at home is the only suitable excersice for me right now. Your yoga movements are also very gentle. The second reason is that yoga is calming down since I'm going through a tuff time in my life. I try to take it as a quality time for myself and focusing on something else than the bad stuff that usually fills my mind. I really appreciate your lessons, your calmness, your effort, I like your voice and ways of telling that every one should listen to their own body and mood. And I know these mantras are to help people, I do know that. Usually, I personnaly don't feel they are for me, and I skip thinking them, but sometimes I play along as much I can. But SOMETIMES, they are too much for me. ""I believe"". I feel really bad that right now I've got nothing I could say I believe in. I'm going through a depression and everything is crushing. I just try to find a way to survive even if there is not that many things I can count on. I just can't relate to that. Once, you said that we should love our feet, look at them and love the way they are. I know that would be great, but I just couldn't. Doing yoga itself makes me feel better in my body, step by step. But when some one, smile on her face, tells me I should look at my feet and love them, I just couldn't and I felt bad that I couldn't and even then, started to cry and had to stop that excersice. I know that the most of this is in my head and my own problems. I think that there are a lot of depressed people that do your yoga and might feel the same, maybe not, maybe it's just me. I just wanted to tell this, that the mantras maybe don't always bring only positivity. But well, I love your yoga otherwise and anyway, hope this will not bring you down too much! Keep going and do what you feel best! Best wishes, Hilla from Finland, the land of negativity and depression. ;)",-0.0937099132,0.90,0.70,0.00,0.50,0.30,0.30,0.50,0.50,2229,A

‚ÄúI am secure‚Äù
Am I ?
‚ÄúI feel secure‚Äù
Do I ?
Is not that I don‚Äôt want, but I don‚Äôt tend to. Consciously I want to, but sub-consciously I‚Äôm more (or I used to be more) the kind of person that freak out about things and how they could go wrong, being anxious about what will be, always thinking about the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù...
And then your calm, the practice, the safe environment, breathing deep inside, the sun rising, everything became clear, such an epiphany...
How much time have I spent worrying about things and how they could get wrong anytime rather then enjoying the ride???
How could I be that person???
‚ÄúEveryone down to extended child pose‚Äù, you said.
And there I am: a child again.
And children feel secure, they are secure, because we parents are there for them to be secure.
What changes in adult life? Or better, why things should change in adult life?
I want my children to feel secure, to be secure, and for that I have to be secure myself.
And I have not a single one acceptable reason not to be secure.
So it‚Äôs now 11 hours past the daily mat, and I eventually seized my mantra.
‚ÄúI can be secure‚Äù
And it will feel good

729,"Dear Adriene. Thank you so much for your positive mind and this amazing challenge! I started last week on a Wednesday and I was so committed and enthusiastic that I turned it up a notch. The first four days I did 4 practices a day, YES INSANITY! On Saturday I only had to do day 13 and 14 and from Sunday on I could start with the daily uploads.

Because of worn knee cartilage, a birth defect at my left SI joint and suffering from brain damage I'm having major issues with balance, getting my thoughts sorted, being in the moment, enjoying life and being in control of my emotions. For my knees and back I tried physiotherapy but that didn't work. For my mind I tried mindfulness, but I can't concentrate enough to keep that up. Yet now I committed to this 31 days I'm noticing a huge difference and it makes me feel good and proud of myself.

Today I was able to stand in tree pose with ease. During plank pose I'm noticing it is getting easier and my body strength is increasing. I even surprise myself when you come up with new challenges to certain poses and I can do it just like that. Last week I often found myself saying ""Oh hell no Adriene! Not happening!"" and now I more like ""Bring it on and lets do it!"". That just happened in one week of hard practice. The only day that was hard on me was day 12, because I literally broke down in tears. So much emotions took over that day, I just surrendered and kept on practicing while crying. I felt better afterwards though!

After these 18 days I feel more in control, aware, mindful, I learned to be better at putting things in perspective and be at peace with what I can and what I cannot do. These changes mean so much to me because it's good to know that although my body isn't a strong as it should be and my brain is messed up, I can feel lots of happiness in where I'm at at this moment and witness stillness and be in control of myself. I needed this so much!

I love your positive vibe and spirit! Much love to you Adriene! Looking forward to tomorrows challenge! I Namaste! <3

Two surgeries in a year is a lot for a knee and a spirit to tackle. But I did it. Yoga is one of the things that has helped me the most in repairing my relationship with my body, but this 31 day series is the first time I have done it so consistently. The change I have experienced is profound. Things that were physically out of reach I am now accomplishing with relative ease (crow pose is a perfect example). Much as I have gotten stronger, I am also trusting my body more, trusting myself more.

Im a person who get very easily frustrated...by most things really (so I need some yoga in my life!), but especially if I feel there's something I can't do, and if I have very little guidance, then I get super stressed.... So....

Adriene: I'm going to take my mic off..
Me: No, no no no, I need you woman!
Music starts: Ok uhm, fine let's do this. She's trying to challenge me, make me find my inner teacher or whatever. Ok let's do this. Uhm... all fours, downward dog... eeeeh what else is there. What is she doing? Ok, that. Fuck it I've already done that. eh eh, uhm uhm. 

So this goes on for about half the vid, and it started out well, tried to find my calm with the music but as I have 0 memory whatsoever, tabletop and downward dog becomes a little boring, so I try following along what she's doing but it's hard without the guidance. And by now I'm really frustrated and I'm trying to think 'way to be alive! way to be human! you're enough' and all that but what I really wanna do is scream 'you worthless piece of shit video, I hate myself! I'm so bad at this!'

So I get frozen on all fours and starts crying in frustration. But I managed to continue and tried to follow along because doing it by myself won't work when I can't remember shit. 

I wanted this to have a good end but it doesn't... I just started crying again at the end.

My nightmare was basically the complete polar opposite of my ecstatic union moment. I felt terrified and was shocked, I actually was flabbergasted that such deep layers of terror exist in my being as well, or may be experienced. I was afraid to go back to sleep so I decided to read up a bit (Dante's Inferno). After a while I decided it was time to go back to bed but I was still scared to go back to sleep. 40 minutes of yoga later I ended up falling asleep on the mat. I think I can go to sleep again now. I listened and was told I should be more careful about where I direct my energy, when to take a step back and be kind to myself and my body. so true. haha. namaste.",-0.9880621433,0.90,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.50,911,A

Today, it clicked. It clicked before this practice even started. While I've always been an active/athletic person, and I've dabbled in yoga for years, and I started to practice with you more regularly starting this August, but this TRUE journey has been my first-ever (!) commitment to setting intentions and practicing daily. My original intention coming in was to work on my flexibility (much needed) and get stronger--but just as you said, the physical benefits of yoga have come secondhand to the spiritual benefits. Syncing up with my breath, clearing my head, connecting--all of that is the hard work, and I find myself now getting on my mat and feeling completely open: no hesitations or expectations, no thinking about the poses, just being and doing.

1602,"I've been doing yoga with Adriene for a little over a month now and I can say that this 30 day yoga has been kicking my butt. I can't do it everyday, working two jobs and being a full time college student, but on the days that I don't have enough time I feel a little different. Then I come back on the matt, and after my practice, I know what the problem was! My biggest problem is paying attention, and getting through the breathing exercises. I have massive ADHD and I absolutely hate sitting/ standing for a period of time because my mind starts to wonder so much, and I get distracted by literally everything in my room. I typically end up skipping some of the breathing exercises that consist of just sitting or standing, but I want to get through it.

I do yoga maybe once every few weeks but I‚Äôm thinking about doing it every day. For all you yogis does yoga help strengthen and tone the body as if you were using weights or doing high intensity workouts? I was thinking about for cardio riding my stationary bike in the morning and then doing yoga in the afternoons To keep a good balance of cardio and strength. someone told me that the reason I keep hurting my lower back is that maybe because my abs are not strong enough. They also said that yoga is very good in building core muscles is this true? All I know is things to Covid and losing my job I have had no motivation to really work out and the high intensity workouts, when I do go to do them they just seem to hurt me.

Seriously though: I missed a bunch of days in a row for several reasons, and they happened, and they don't matter any more.  What matters is being here on the mat again, and the intention to be back tomorrow.  To always come back, even if there's a gap.  And I've got that.

In other related news, I think I need a literal yoga mat.  While I didn't do great at connecting to center today, I did feel very very firmly in my whole body that finding my center is almost impossible if I don't have a good base to start from--and there is not enough friction on my living room rug to ever feel truly secure in my base.  I CAN do the wide-legged stances and ground into my feet.  I have that strength.  But when I'm using nearly all the strength I have just to press into the ground so I don't instantly slip into a wider splits than my body can handle, there's none left to find center with.  It's a disadvantage I haven't even really paid attention to playing with, and it's HARD.

So.  A real yoga mat.  Continued determination.  It all comes from there.",-0.9910286069,0.80,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.60,0.50,-0.40,0.00,1108,A

I just haven't felt comfortable going back to that environment. i started working with a nutritionist/trainer in October to lose some menopause pounds and she turned me on to Adriene and i'm so glad - she spoke to my heart immediately. i've enjoyed just as much, the community that she has inspired and fosters.

2455,"Keeping myself accountable: Day 30!!!

At the start of the practice with the announcement of there not going to be any instruction, I panicked. But I quickly got into doing my own movements and following by breath, not long after I started getting lost, not naturally moving and seeking out instruction... I pushed on trying to get back into the flow and eventually I did. This somewhat represents my journey throught the whole practice. I was scared of failing yet again at the start, but then turning up became natural and fun thing only for it then to become difficult to find the time, energy or peace of mind to be fully emerged in the practice... Nearing the end of this challenge I again got into the fun and flow of showing up for practice. This is my third time trying the 30 day challenge, and third time lucky, I succeeded! I started the challenge with the goal of trying to see if i could keep myself accountable if i posted to the world whether i showed up, the fear of disappointing not just myself but others too was a great motivator but once I got into that end flow I realised I didnt need it anymore because I was truly capable of showing up and doing this for myself. 

I did it. I shed many tears throught the challenge at Adriene's kind words, especially the one about taking up space because we deserve to, but now I'm shedding tears because I am proud of being able to succeed in showing up for myself.

Your gentle voice, humor and meaningful messages are so nice to listen to and your yoga instruction is absolutely spot on for a newbie.  Thank you so much for your thoughtful and detailed instruction. You are the whole package! You are making a difference. üôÇ",0.9998692274,0.90,0.80,0.00,0.90,0.80,0.00,0.80,0.80,532,D

2514,You have some of the best scaffolding teaching I've experienced. I struggle with tree pose hard but it felt a bit better after the practice of just lifting each leg a few times to find the balance and then trying to hold it.
