      "So half a year ago, I started being unhappy about my body. I would say I wasn't fat, but I sure was a little a chubby. I hoped the puberty will repair it all, but then I decided to change. I started with pilates on YouTube and spent 5 months making myself do that two short intense videos for abs and legs. It worked. I would say I'm more toned now, but the stress of beginning school again and all that depression and sad thoughts I sometimes have, made me want to stop and just cry. I was too lazy to do that same boring exercise again and again and it somehow made me very annoyed. Few days ago I tried Yoga. I suddenly realised that for my calm, introvertal and very stressing self is the relaxing and slow Yoga MUCH better that the fast and intense workouts I've been doing. Doing Yoga is a while I have for myself, just me and the blanket. It made me be really looking towards exercising. I feel so better now!
