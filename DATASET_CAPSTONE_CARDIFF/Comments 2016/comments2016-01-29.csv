64.0,"ü§ó Hi friend!! Happy Day 29 on Dec. 29! It's your lucky number day, so I hope today is full of awesome surprises and that the love flows endlessly from the universe through you today and every day.

Last couple days of practice were really hard for me, and so I tried doing different things; I went on a long walk, I layed down on my yoga mat (sometimes for a couple hours on end, next to my salt lamp) and just found ways to feel supported. 

I also went back to read my comments on the last 30 Days Of Yoga to see how I felt around this time; not realizing that I inadvertently created a Yoga journal (that I ended up sharing with you and the world lol) and I felt then how I felt now! So I realized maybe I should keep a Yoga Journal to see my thoughts more clearly: where they repeat and how they change. I also noticed that there have been so many thoughts I haven't been sharing because not all of them are positive (towards myself) or a bit repetitive and so I've been keeping them inside, not realizing that maybe keeping them inside is probably what's causing them to manifest as energy  blockages. I'm not really sure to be honest. 

I feel really good today. The guacamole I made came out really well today, the morning is clear and I saw you again which is awesome. Btw, I'm an only child as well :) Namaste üôè",UgwA4ZVUAEbJs8WRM-J4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-12-29T15:05:44Z,0.9867873191833496

It was such a great mantra to start the close of yoga camp because, at least for me, it helped to reaffirm the other mantras.

179.0,"Dear Adriene,
 You‚Äôve changed my life. I‚Äôll tell you why this is not an exaggeration: ¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞1) I‚Äôve been flirting with yoga for 10 years now (got to know it when I travelled to India when I was 22, practiced when I was in Bali for a few months 2y ago)... but I‚Äôve never been able to maintain a daily practice (I mean, years went by without).  You did it. The way you teach beginners is just SPOT ON, it all just ‚Äòclicked‚Äô suddenly. It‚Äôs exactly what I needed to gain confidence, to gain interest and curiosity, to just get me on my mat ‚Äìevery single day. ¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞2) I‚Äôve been struggling with the ‚Äòqualities‚Äô of patience and discipline my whole life. You teached me that, by your way of teaching, by not pushing, by asking me to find what feels good. ¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞3) I walk differently now, more straight and more relaxed. I used to walk a little hunched over, with my but sticking out (ri-di-cu-lous! but I was just never able to fix that). ¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞4) After so many years on this earth, I finally know what it means to be ‚Äòinto my body‚Äô, to feel ‚Äòaligned‚Äô ‚Ä¶ I no longer drag around a bag of flesh. <3 <3 <3 Eternal love and gratitude from Belgium to you! (By the way, have been telling all my friends about you, but guess what?!, a lot of them knew you already!! That‚Äôs how amazing you are!!)",Ugj3uv7SnWiVxXgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2016-06-27T20:31:35Z,0.9925520420074463

197.0,"I'm trying to lose weight for the last year, and eating food I do not like, trying to work out. The problem is I have depression problem for my whole life, I have the lack of endotrophin receptors. Meaning that the myth of coming out of the workout happy and fulfilled and all that crap is just a myth for me. I get out of a workout tired and often as not a sobbing mess, because the chemicals start flowing, and unfortunately I get the short end of the happy ones, while the other ones just make me feel shitty.
Spring is here and everybody is talking about working out, and I should, but I am scared shitless going through that again (been in hardcore training few years back, I lost weight, but I cried all the time, meds or not). 
I reached the weight platou 2 mths ago (before I lost 4kg in a month), and it's not moving ANYWHERE. And I'm losing hope here. I need to lose 10 more kilos. 
Yoga is basically the only thing I've discovered so far, that keeps me in control of my mind while 'working out' most of the time. Not today, though. Hopefully, I will calm down.",UgiY0mFjssd-wHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-04-13T16:51:10Z,-0.9984459280967712

Thanks Adriene for this 30 days of yoga camp. I'm behind and just finishing it up now. It's been a great ride. I love yoga. I am learning to love myself. I am able to do things I never thought possible and have started accepting and being less critical of the things I can't do today, keeping an open mind that MAYBE tomorrow (or next week or month or year or...) I may be able to do them. I have followed you for over a year, and you opened my eyes to how yoga should make you strong but at the same time feel good, not feel like punishment.

I have to confess that when I read your email about this practice I felt a bit worried because I said to myself ""No way I can pull this off!"" I mean, how many times have I said to myself I Love Myself? But for some reason, the moment I stepped on to the mat I started repeating in my head all the things I loved until there was nothing else to love but me... This was it! This was the unevitable challenge! There wasn't any choice left but repeating I Love myself even if I didn't resonate with it¬†at all...Adriene, this is not stupid at all. If there's people who believe it, it's because they're just hiding behind words and prejudice and because it seems easier to accept this mindset. I mean, ""it's better the devil you know than the devil you don't"", right?Anyway, this experience was the hardest and the most rewarding I've had so far.

246.0,"Thank you so much for this experience.  I realized my need to start shifting my self talk back in November and found your channel and the 30 days of yoga videos that you did last year.  I followed through with all 30 videos and about 20 days in realized how much I just wanted to go home every day and do yoga.  Physically, I felt amazing and so in harmony with my body, but I felt that there was a mental component missing.  I was still harbouring some negative self talk in my mind and I wasn't happy with that. 
These Yoga Camp videos have changed my life.  The daily mantras have enabled me to focus on what I am truly grateful for in my life and shift my way of thinking about myself.  I can honestly say I am much more happy in general than when I started out.  I can now also honestly say that I love myself and that has never before been true in my life.  A few of the mantras did indeed bring tears to my eyes but those were the ones that meant the most.

Last year, I had been doing yoga irregularly for like a year or so, 30 Days of Yoga made me commit to a daily home practice in 2015 and this was also the year when the effects of practicing daily hit me kinda hard. You know, I started to see things more clearly, get to know my body so much better, my intuition grew stronger, I had so many revelations about myself, my life, my past and my present, my relationships, everything.
