56.0,"Hello everyone 🤗 Goddess pose is soo not as easy at it looks. I closed my eyes to dig deep from the burning throughout my entire body, and even then it was like I was sitting in fire! During the asana, I wondered: ""Isn't this how Goddess Kali is usually depicted in most of her pictures/statues? It makes sense since so powerful!"" When I couldn't take it anymore, I opened my eyes, and you were looking directly at me/us (I was at the thumbnail part of this video) while smiling, and I felt something inside of me bow to you. 🙏 It's such a powerful thing to see someone thrive (or even appear to be okay) during a time when everyone else is quitting/suffering. I failed to maintain the pose (and I was barely able to keep up during the whole practice), but since I don't bring my ego to practice, it gave me clarity in the realization that I have much to learn, plenty to get stronger, and things to focus on outside of yoga practice to fix (like lack of sleep, overtraining, energetically draining people) that take away from things that really matter to me; so I redirect my energy and focus to the things that matter. I am strong because I simplify. 💪",UgyQU2LMdJ6xa0VuuzF4AaABAg,0.0,6.0,2019-12-24T15:33:39Z,0.9962632060050964

70.0,"Dang, I didn't know you broke your tailbone.  I know you said you were in a car accident.  I think that's what lead me to this because I cracked mine when I was younger.  I couldn't run, jog, yet I could walk but with severe pain.  It was like this for about six months, and then it just went away one day.  I don't believe it healed correctly, as I wasn't taken to the hospital, so this sort of messed up my spine.  Fast forward to about a year, and a half ago when I fell out the truck, and sliced my left outer leg open.  The cut healed, but I do believe the fall jigged my bones out of whack.  I was having a huge amount of pain in back, and was using ice, pain killers, resting, and it wouldn't go away.  I would go to the chiropractor twice a week, and then once a month.  The chiropractor even stated if I were opted for surgery he would not recommend it because my bones are all jacked up (not Arnold style).  He said I have an extra vertebrae, and I have two growth points that haven't come through yet; they were white spots on the x-ray.  It's weird to walk because rarely can I just walk normal.  I usually walk with pain, and sometimes the sciatic nerve gives out, and I get a shock then bend the knee.  Sometimes my legs just feel heavy like anvils, and it feels as if I can't pick them up to walk.  My friend told me to try these videos, and I would say they are helping a bit.  After the videos I usually have energy to walk around, and I have been getting toned up, and losing weight.  I do still have pain, but I believe if I keep doing these videos one day it will be gone!

83.0,"One of the first Yoga With Adriene videos I tried about a year ago had a crow pose in it, and I couldn't even get one toe off the ground. I honestly felt defeated and weak, but like Adriene says; it's a practice and you have to keep returning to it. I went from doing yoga once to twice a week, to now sticking with an *almost* daily yoga practice since the new year. (It's okay to take breaks sometimes!) And today, finally- I held my crow pose for a whole 2 seconds! Now you may be saying ""Lividplatypus, 2 seconds isn't that much!"" But GIRL, I am here to tell you I have never felt more powerful and seeing and knowing that I freaking DID THAT has just been one of the amazing and unexpected joys I've had since starting this journey. 


So thank you Adriene, as cliche as it sounds, you've honestly changed my life.  Watch out next year when I hold on to that crow pose for 3 seconds ;)

151.0,"Adriene,

I've been doing yoga with you for about 6 months now. I started this past winter during a pretty awful time I was going through, riddled with anxiety and depression that had resulted in a few unhealthy addictions as well. I had never been a fan of yoga: everytime I'd tried doing it, it had left me unsatisfied & annoyed because none of the instructors I'd watched ever seemed to have much of a grasp on their audience. Everything was either way too fast, way too slow, awful at explaining things properly, unfriendly, etc. Honestly, I never thought yoga would be anything I cared about.

Then I found you. 

When I first started doing your videos...I was crap. I couldn't breathe properly, I had to take breaks every other pose, there were MANY poses I couldn't even begin to wrap my mind around, not to mention it was all incredibly exhausting. All in all, I felt pretty hopeless as a yogi. 

And yet...I stayed. I don't know what it is about you, but YOU are one of the most genuine, beautiful, empowering, and inspiring people I have ever known. 

With your encouragement & guidance, I've gotten better. A LOT better. This journey has grown me in so many awesome ways, and helped me find strength I never even knew I had. I am also closer to God than I have ever been in my life, and with Him, and you on my side, I am cultivating more love, faith, true happiness, and inner peace than ever before. It is amazing. 

I am writing this because I didn't feel like doing yoga tonight.

I did it anyway.

Through strength, stability, lots of sweat, and the incredible power of the breath...I OWNED Day 25. 

And I just wanna say...

Thank you, Adriene. You are truly a gift to this world.",UggaGwtUMRqofXgCoAEC,1.0,183.0,2016-06-29T05:23:22Z,0.9979481101036072

245.0,"I have been loving Yoga Camp SOOOOOOOO MUCH! The mantra that has been with me every day is: GO WITH THE FLOW. I tend to be a bit apprehensive, like to meet deadlines a day early if possible, do a million things in one day and I also have the all or nothing personality. So accepting that last Sunday was just a no-workout-what-so-ever day and now being a day behind and being OK with it, definitely is challenging; just facing value and acknowledging that deadlines sometimes are met late and the world still keeps turning pretty smoothly and that it doesn't make me a less professional person is not something I am necessarily comfortable with, but at least it's not stressing me out. But to go with the flow for me personally is also a great teacher to surrender to God's will and allowing him to be in charge. Just today I had decided to move my practice to the evening instead of doing it in the morning and ended up doing day 25 instead of 24; in the middle of the practice when holding a high lounge I became aware that I would not have enjoyed this practice as much at 5 am than I did now, being stronger and more awake at the end of the day.

292.0,"Thank you for this awesome work out! I am 53 and I feel so empowered and happy! This series is exactly what I wanted to learn after last years 30 days of yoga series. That taught me so much about yoga poses and my own strength. This series has taught me how to go deeper, my meditation before I start my video in the morning is so much better, more focused and in turn I have opened up to a new business venture and more opportunities seem to present themselves to me. My hubby is pretty happy with the change in me too, 26 years and counting! Yoga works, for EVERYTHING!",UgiyhujUsrKoingCoAEC,1.0,18.0,2016-01-26T18:36:55Z,0.9998040795326233

You are such an inspirational teacher and I really look to your teaching as a model of how to ""find what feels good"":)  Thanks!",Ugj2AUrCx0VebngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-26T17:40:05Z,0.9998015761375427
