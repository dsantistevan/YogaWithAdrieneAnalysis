0.0,The mantra I am present means a lot to me. I say that to myself a few times. About 1 month ago I made the desicion to not end my own life. Even though I really wanted to. The mantra: 'I am present' gives energy to fight my demons. Anyone who is struggling know that you are not alone and you will get through this hold on.,UgzY2PsAMX7sGSinbbB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-14T16:58:09Z,0.9993533492088318

12.0,"My 30 days so far have not been perfect. I fall off because I do alot of other training and I tend to push yoga aside in favor of weight training or cardio. But when I do it I remember why I need it and that yoga is the last thing I should be pushing aside. I definitely need yoga in my life. It awakens my mind, heart and body and frees my soul from all the burdens and pain I have experienced in life. I love to fly in my yoga poses and feel weightless and happy. Even if once I step off the mat I forget that feeling. Eveytime I'm on the mat I feel and see a light shining inside me and it give me so much peace. The same peace I see when I watch my children playing and laughing and learning. Thank You for Yoga camp. I think this is one of my favorite 30 day challenges.",Ugw9sYbEpKJtHPHdYcl4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-07-22T12:43:00Z,0.9985542893409729

I really appreciated this mantra.

And I chose to be a lot more gentle with the parts of myself that weren’t present. Which just sort of shifted everything for me and I was able to let go a bit more!

71.0,"I started doing yoga after my therapist mentioned it. Apparently I'm not really good at paying attention to my body and what I feel INSIDE my body. I stumbled across Adriene and began the Beginners yoga starting out 4 times a week for about 3-4 weeks. Then, I started this yoga camp. I never ever ever thought I would be doing yoga but here I am on day 10 and I haven't missed a day and it feels SO good. It seems like I'm waking up my body after years of sleeping muscles. I can feel them stretch without it hurting and Adriene's encouragement, humor (sometimes I have to stop the videos to laugh with her) has opened my eyes to something I never knew I needed. I love how she explains things so well and how she always wants us to ""find what feels good"", I'm very overweight and just knowing that in these practices I can just do what feels good and find out what my body needs is perfect for me. Adriene, if you find yourself reading this sometime, please know you are so appreciated and I'm so thankful for your teachings (and humor).

If you fart, and you are doing this with someone though, they might not laugh it off, and I cannot be responsible for that, sorry."" Adriene always has a way to make you laugh. I was squeezing this practice in on a Saturday afternoon so as not to miss it. Almost 40 minutes, yikes! But nothing resetting the speed at 1.25x could not fix. My usual when short of time. This might be one of my favorites. I liked the tips she shared on this one. I do not mind all the talking. I need the instruction and later, I can watch with the sound off as can anyone who prefers silence. As for pigeon pose, I like to rest my head in my clasped hands. Seems easier on my long arms.

111.0,"Thank you for another great session Adrienne;  Yoga camp has 
already been an amazing and eye opening experience on many different levels...outside of the obvious physical and mental health benefits most of us come to expect from regular practice, there is something about participating in yoga camp, something about committing ourselves to 30 days of (hopefully..lol) uninterrupted and continuous practice that allows one to access a subtle level of perception that is at once  extremely powerful yet paradoxically faint and elusive..one gets the distinct impression that this perception, or perhaps more accurately, the deep  and fundementally interconnected fabric reality that we are able to perceive, has been there all along right under our noses; but much like one of those old three dimensional stereogram posters, if you look too hard, (if you try too hard) the 3 d picture disappears and your just looking a collection dots...i belive yoga helps us to defocalize our sometimes narrow and constricted survival -based awareness while allowing us to reconnect with the natural intuitive feeling that sees past the illusion of separation and into the depths the psyche, the fabric of reality,  and the true nature of  consciousness...much gratitude for all your hard work and dedication Adrienne...

Now I am following the yoga camp sessions. Adrienne's yoga does not push too mush so I feel rather relaxed and capable. Because of Adrienne, yoga has become my daily routine and I feel great. I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for about two years time. Taking antidepressant, accepting counseling and doing yoga lead me on my way back back to my normal life.

I just wanted to share a small story and say how grateful I am for these videos. I've been following Yoga With Adriene for about 3 years now, and several videos have helped me through my depression and anxiety but none like today. I jumped on the Yoga Camp train a little late, but I just finished Day 10 and the mantra ""I am present"" meant so much to me. I was struggling heavily today, trapped in the past and toxic thoughts, and I didn't even want to do yoga. I pulled up the video and groaned when I saw it was almost 40 minutes long, and I had a really difficult time settling in. I was fidgety and I had a hard time focusing on my breath, still thinking toxic thoughts and trying not to cry, but I just kept repeating ""I am present."" By the end of the video, I wasn't even focused on my problems anymore. I had smiled and laughed during the video, and when it was finished I was groaning that it was over! 
Anyway, I'm not usually big into sharing but I really did want to share this and send a big thank you to Adriene for these awesome videos!

I love spending a longer amount of time in pigeon, and never feel the benefits when people rush thru it. Bless you and thankyou so much for this lovely month of focus and yoga. One question, or observation. I can say the phrase a thousand times but I can't seem to make myself be it/feel it/ focus on it, etc... I just say the words. I love having the WORD to focus on, but feeling it is different. I just don't know how to do that. Any thoughts?
Also, I have heard that drishti is very important, but i often close my eyes during practice because it is sort of my meditatioon. You are one of the few that says we can close our eyes fairly often, but you also talk about drishti. What are your thoughts? I almost wish you'd do a chat on here to talk about these things.

441.0,"I'm getting tired... It's been a bit hard to make this yoga camp and everything that's happening work. Been traveling, studying, exams are coming... I've done only three days of camp at my home, the rest of them were on the go. But I still managed not to miss a day, and i gave my best to stay in the practice, to do this in a mindful way and i have to say i feel happy and proud!!!
Just rolled out my mat and I am looking forward to this beautiful day 10!
Keep it up everyone, don't give up, we're half way through!!",UgiZxU6MrX3rBHgCoAEC,2.0,105.0,2016-01-11T12:38:24Z,0.9994691014289856
