0.0,"I had a couple long, physically demanding days and today woke up feeling like I'd been run over by a truck. My body feels like it weighs a thousand pounds. As I went through the video, I kept veering away to freestyle into what my body feels like it needed. I don't usually comment, but I wanted to say this was a testament to the wonderful attitude you cultivate on this channel and in your videos that I felt empowered to do so. And not only that I felt empowered to break away, but that it felt right to do so. That I felt like I was honoring my body, where I would normally feel guilty that I was cheating because I didn't want to do the hard stuff. So thank you, Adriene!

257.0,"I am grateful for Adriene & everything that YWA as given me. I started doing yoga every morning over a year ago just as a way to stretch out my back after I'd wake up with a tightness between my shoulders. Now I *need* my morning YWA sessions; I have never been a morning person my entire life, but I will wake myself up at 5 am if I have to. It started as something I squeezed in if I had time, but now I make the time for it. I may still do all vinyasas from the knees and will probably never do any hopping to or from plank, but my body has changed immensely in this past year. Even six months ago, I never would have imagined being in a standing split and not feeling like I was going to fall.  

Also the book I am reading right now is about living with ADD; I got my diagnosis finally @ age 26 and learning more about it has helped me truly understand who I am (it's not just someone who can't get her life together). 

Thank you Adriene for every message of self care, self love, patience, dedication, and all the silly moments. Those are my favorite moments and a reason I've never looked for another yoga channel.",UgiUjCI1qXEhI3gCoAEC,1.0,0.0,2017-05-10T09:59:31Z,0.9977343082427979

329.0,"My favorite book is The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon (originally written in spanish as La Sombra del Viento.) I come from a family of readers but before reading this book I was only familiar with books assigned at school that weren't too exciting for me. I could never understand why my mom and brother would voluntarily read books all the time, but I took them up on their suggestion of reading this one anyways and it marked a turning point in my life. I never knew I could love reading so much! At the core it's a book about books (disguised as a mystery) and that makes it so much more special to me. Needless to say that I started reading books for pleasure after this one.
I feel somewhat the same about yoga as I do about this book. I'm not a person that likes playing sports but that doesn't mean I don't like using my body and being active. I started practicing yoga in high school when we got a free health pocket book with the sunday newspaper which had the tiniest section about yoga. It was the first time in my life that I actually enjoyed being active and I kept at it for about a year. When I moved to the US about 6 years ago I was too busy with colleague to keep it up but I discovered YogaWithAdriene last year and it has made such a great impact in my life. What started as a desire to stay fit has become so much more than that and I am so grateful for helping me connect with myself and my surroundings.

340.0,"At the beginning of this practice when I was rubbing my hands together I suddenly had a flashback to when I was 7 years old, sitting on the floor of my grade three classroom. The teacher asked us all to rub our hands together as fast as we could and to tell her what we noticed. One kid looked at his hands, wide-eyed and amazed, and exclaimed, ""RUBBER!"" The teacher laughed and informed us all that that was just dirt he saw on his hands and that what she really wanted us to notice was the heat that was generated by friction. I laughed too remembering that! So today my mantra was 'I am grateful for the laughter in my life and the people who bring it'. Adriene, you are also one of those people! Wishing you and everyone here lots of laughter and joy. Namaste.

405.0,"Hi Adrienne! I am entirely grateful for yoga camp and for your beautiful soul! It has been such a journey, and I am loving every moment of it. 

I am currently reading 'The Art of Loving' by Erich Fromm. It reflects on the dynamics on the different types of love, and the ways that we all experience that love in our lives. I highly recommend it to you, especially if you have ever questioned relationship that you assumed was love, or was almost love, but you really could not put your finger on it. It has taught me a lot about myself.

Also, while I have your attention, I had a very important question. I am 6 foot 1 (Yeah I know, I'm tall. haha) and even though I have been practicing yoga for several months, mostly with your videos but also in classes, I am still having spacial issues. I don't know how to describe it, I know I am grounded, I can feel my foundation and my lifts, but I still feel like I'm not in the right position. And I still have trouble with hopping, jumping, or stepping myself back up. Maybe this just comes with getting to know my body just a little more, but I was just wondering if this issue has ever manifested itself in other students you've had with my height? Or maybe I'm just way overthinking it and I just need to let my body do the talking? Let me know what you think either way! Any suggestions on how to improve this would be very much appreciated!

Love has no cause, it is the astrolabe of God's secrets.
Lover and loving are inseparable and timeless.
Although I may try to describe love,
when I experience it, I am speechless.
Although I may try to write about love, I am rendered helpless.
