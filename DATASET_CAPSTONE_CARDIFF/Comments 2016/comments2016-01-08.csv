6.0,"Struggled with the mantra, so much in my life feels beyond my control and honing in on anything I had a 'choice' about felt like a non-starter. It feels like I'm fighting, constantly, on so many fronts. And then it clicked: I choose my battles. From today I'm going to really focus in on choosing which battles are worth it, and crucially choosing not to fight them all. At least... not all at once.

This practice was special for another reason - it's the first time in several years of doing yoga that I've left my hair down, trusting that I'd be able to find what feels good in my own way (I am super sensitive about my hair catching on my clothes, brushing the floor, or sticking to my skin and getting in my face/eyes/nose/mouth). It felt so freeing, I just had to share <3",UgwTZWY-Xu4i43-y3EB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-10-22T21:40:31Z,0.6371026039123535

113.0,"‚úîÔ∏è Namaste from a rainy California this weekend! I feel like everything gets crazier in the rain, like the drivers, the people, my low grade anxiety (lol) but overall it's chill. Today, I chose to embrace my imperfections. One of the things I've been working on is being more present as a friend. I find that it's a lot easier (but not helpful at all) when listening to friends, or anyone and overshadow their feelings; saying things ""oh yeah, that happened to me to!"" Or maybe even make them inadvertently feel worse about something they feel is a weakness. One of my friends in particular is person who get often used by people because of her kindness and inability to say no when someone needs help. Which is actually an amazing trait: to be unconditionally helpful. But it definitely sucks to hear how this makes her feel, and I get so caught up witj ""oh yeah, you can't be doing that, you gotta be strong because that's not okay"" or something along those lines. But then I remember that I'm doing that thing; where I'm taking someone else's moment and making that about me. 

As a parallel metaphor, I guess it's like what inattentive parents do when kids try to tell them about their day and then they get lectured instead of being heard...until eventually the kids don't tell them anything anymore. And those kids grow up to be me, to be us and crave that connection to be heard because the isolation is so deep into the subconscious.

With my friend, I made them a promise that I will do my best to accept that I tend to project and make it about me, and that unless I can help them bake those cakes for the party she wasn't invited to, I'm not going to aggravate it by dumping how I feel about all this into the vent sessions. And I think I picked this up from yoga practice and you, because I've been able to improve my life the most by focusing inward and being allowed to feel whatever I feel instead of being told how to feel.

This happened on another video of yours that I did last month on Mother‚Äôs Day where you mentioned a lucky lady bug in your studio. That was my mom‚Äôs symbol to me. She passed away promising me that she would show up in my life as a lady bug and has so many times when I‚Äôm seriously  in need of her.

Not only did I have a really stiff neck before this video, I have recently been worrying about whether I should live with my boyfriend and his family after uni or live with my family after uni because he doesn't think he'll be happy with a long distance relationship. We still have one  more year at uni and when you said just let go I was so much more relaxed. I mean I'm also worried about what I'll do after uni but the truth is worrying doesn't change anything, it just makes you more stressed and this video made me realise that. I've been trying to live for the moment and to be honest your videos are the only time I truly feel like I am enjoying that specific moment so thank so much for your channel. It has even encouraged me to join the yoga society where I have made a friend for life.

I wonder if anyone else sees this amazing aura you emanate and I want to do they same.

Keeping a journal, and creating the mantra's each day writing at least 5 for each day.  Then chosing one and posting it on facebook quoting myself.  Yet because I'm choosing to keep this a secret from people on facebook (3000+ people) I will surprise them all at the end of this adventure.  I'm brand new to yoga.  One of my commitments to myself this 2016 is self care.  Doing yoga is a part of this self care commitment.

I choose peace
I choose to create abundance
I choose to slow down and take time for me
I choose to create my reality
