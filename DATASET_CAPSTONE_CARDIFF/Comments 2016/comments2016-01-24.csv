51.0,"‚òï Hi friends! Today's mantra reminded me of Viktor Frankl's philosophy: that one of the few things we have full control over is our attitude and response towards any situation. I can't remember how many times I've been irritated or annoyed or felt some way towards something totally out of my control. But as the monk Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us, every moment is an opportunity to practice mindfulness. We can always change the story we are telling ourselves about situations or our own choices. I tell myself this, but also try to work on it by trying to catch myself and not dwelling long an emotion. Or if I can, I remove myself from it entirely. But often, when I'm faced with difficulty, I see it as test of my true inner strength and how independent of a person I truly am...and I need plenty work.

Love your mirth and depth (a wonderful paradox).  In search a better mind-soul-body connection I found your youtube channel. My daily practice has been a place of grounding as I am a single mom going through a divorce.  I get on the mat every evening after I put my little guy to bed, exhausted, confused, worried, heavy-hearted and leave knowing I am connected to something deeper and held by something greater.  You are a delight.  Also, I have a blue heeler that looks so much like yours (maybe the initial reason I started following you).  His name is Ebbett.  Look forward to today's practice, ""i am in control"" which is a constant lesson of letting go of things I can't to take what I can: my thoughts, actions, and joy.

I haven't been able to do it in the morning for about 2 months now because of work but this was a lovely way to start the day. I'll definitely be coming back to this video again to appreciate it more fully!

225.0,"Holy fire burnin fire burnin in my thighs lol! Great tho, this practice was a lot of fun! ... I loved today's mantra, probably one of my favorites! Due to heavy dance practice when I was younger, I have Osgood-Shlatter's disease ... sounds scarier than it really is... basically just causes the bone in my knee to protrude out slightly when I bend it. Prior to yoga camp I have always felt a little bummed out that I sometimes need to use a towel under my right knee in child's pose/ table top or sometimes have to cross my ankles in child's pose to avoid discomfort. You remind us to embrace our differences and modify and I love that ... it really not only fosters self love ... but it reminds everyone here that we are in control of our bodies! Find what feels good. Thank you Adriene :) Namaste!",Uggbv4aq8KEFj3gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-26T04:51:06Z,0.9987866282463074

I came to the mat with extra caution today as I'm nursing some soreness/stiffness in the neck, and by being conscious and mindful of each movement, I was still able to practice without aggravating further injury.

232.0,"This practice was by far the hardest to do. Today marks 21 years since I survived an accident that almost took my life in high school. I never really think about it, and honestly,  I was going along oblivious about the whole thing for most of the day. Then, bam! It hit me in the middle of signing the date in one of my kid's exercise books. Since then, since I remembered, I'd been holding this lump in my chest. You know, the kind that's just balled up emotion. It wasn't budging, wouldn't move, that is, until I sat on the mat and started my practice. I think I cried until you got to the 7 min mark, then I took a deep breath and started again. It took me two tries to do this class today, but I was determined that I would do this practice, I was going to finish. And I did.",Ugg5GP_1yFhYT3gCoAEC,9.0,265.0,2016-01-26T01:59:39Z,-0.9938549399375916

234.0,"THANK YOU SO MUCH!  I am combining your yoga camp with Weight Watchers (for the 5th time) and I swear that your yoga is helping me have an entirely new perspective for the first time!  I used to dance over 30 years ago so there is some muscle memory there but your yoga is helping me re-connect and feel empowered for the first time in a long time.  I teach dance and have a very similar movement philosophy.  I hope that my classes are as yummy as yours have been for me.  It is truly changing my life.  

One more note: yesterday was the first day I didn't get to do your yoga first thing in the morning. My whole day was off kilter.  Thankfully, I got to do it at the end of the day.  I went to bed feeling wonderful and woke up feeling refreshed, having slept soundly through the night, and was so excited to roll out the mat and see your smiling face again this morning.
