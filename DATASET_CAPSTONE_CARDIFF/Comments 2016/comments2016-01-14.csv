0.0,"I've always been a person who goes with the flow. I accept what happens to me and I carry on. So I go with the flow. And I sometimes let the currents drag me. Ihave moments when I don't want to go with the flow, I want to take resposibilities and decide for myself. So my intentions for today are: I go with the flow when I enjoy it and I am careful to not let the currents drag me away from what I want to do.",Ugwtm9rLhOim12QM3dJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-15T20:04:50Z,0.9915306568145752

49.0,"If anyone reading this is dipping in and out of yoga, as I did for years, let me tell you: Yoga only begins to impart its true gifts when you commit to a daily practice. Thank you, Adriene, for making it a joy to stay on the path. ❤️

I've been doing daily Yoga with Adriene for 1.5 months (thanks to the pandemic shutting down all our swimming pools in high summer). On this day (halfway through my second 30-day journey), for the first time, downward dog became a resting pose that I didn't want to come out of. Then, also for the first time, I effortlessly grabbed both feet in seated forward fold.

I'm not naturally flexible and I've never been ""good"" at yoga. Just 1.5 months in, my body and mind feel completely different: I'm lighter on the mat and more supple in life; I eat smaller meals; I've even noticed myself taking certain inconveniences in my stride, whereas previously I was type A. Most of all, I crave my daily YwA 😊 🧘 💕",UgzmGVvfNrle0cuG9kl4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2020-09-08T12:01:40Z,0.992263913154602

76.0,"Another great stretch into the unknown corners of my body ;+) i wish I'd put my phone at the front of my Matt this time instead of side on cos i kept looking side ways, thinking it was the best place. Good stretches though ! :+) Not sure why someone thought it was too easy, it's meant to be a wide spectrum of ability for the open to all levels, you can't scare off the newbies and returners . There is a great shortage of yoga videos for returners, who are best going back to beginner but sometimes it would be nice to just get the instructions and with a mind to return rather than begin for first time. But this is perfect for that anyway!! Xx",Ugy32PNRvanF4ZF5Ne94AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-02-03T09:12:08Z,0.7582198977470398
77.0,"👋 Today's practice reminded me a lot of Bruce Lee and his teachings of ""being like water."" Especially when you mentioned how flow can be achieved after doing something for a long time. I believe Bruce Lee called this achieving a state of ""unnatural naturalness"" or ""natural unnaturalness."" Many of the asanas or vinyasa flows taught to us seem almost effortless--unless someone tries it! Then the effort of countless hours of practice and the true humility of the teacher becomes apparent (Namaste 🙏). The affirmation in the beginning changed for me; first I tried saying I choose to go with the flow...but it didn't feel right. So then I tried ""I am the flow."" And that felt powerful. A series of ""bad habits"" can be just as powerful of a flow as a series of good ones. I'd like to end with a quote from Rumi: ""I am not a drop in the ocean, but I am the entire ocean in a drop."" For us, the universe flows into us through our five senses; and the words, thoughts and actions that flow out of us is the universe that we've created for ourselves. Our entire world is our perspective, so to be in flow with the universe means to unlearn everything and grow anew each day through practice. Tonight is 12/12, so I hope the new Sagittarius moon gives that big moon energy to us to break free to new things! 🌝",UgxCx1iPQRk1DKfaSxR4AaABAg,0.0,14.0,2019-12-13T00:57:43Z,0.9961919784545898

We passed a family from the neighborhood and they were paddling upstream!! They were struggling and we laughed that they were going the wrong way!  Tonight we saw them at the mailboxes and they shared that after 15 minutes they exited the river because it was “just too hard”!, but my husband and I were “going with the flow” of the river and it was easy peasy for us!!

131.0,"I LOVE Yoga Camp!! I loved TRUE!! I've been doing yoga with Adriene for 44 days straight now - after many months and years of so-called ""high intensity"" workouts, this particular yoga practice - the way Adriene teaches it - has given me my life back. I have no idea who emailed you, Adriene, complaining it wasn't ""enough,"" but clearly it just wasn't the right fit for her. It is absolutely the right fit for me and I have actually never felt so in tune with my body or so fit and connected to all parts of me before in my whole life. After 20 years of an eating disorder and now 5 months of thyroid disorder, I am losing weight, gaining height, watching my systemic pain reduce daily and everyone I know is telling me how good and healthy I look! Truly, this is the way - the respect you show for the hard-working body by tuning in, reaching in, setting intentions, inviting exploration and adventure, helping the mind and body work together - my friend and I are doing your classes together (separated by several states) and we both agree we simply LOVE Yoga with Adriene!

242.0,"Adriene there are always going to be people who criticize, that is just what they do. If the practice is not what they need, there are so many options in the internet, the door is wide open for them to leave. We don't need no stinking negativity here!!! But to be honest, I feel compassion for them as well since they suffer the most because of their negativity.  So one of these days, let's dedicate a practice to all those in need of some positivity in their lives.  

The practice that you set out can be easy or hard depending on what each individual brings to it. A yogi that truly inspired my practice claims that one can do just one asana and in varying degrees of difficulty and that is still considered yoga practice if it helps the individual develop.  

I like your positive spirit, your wise outlook, your humor, your creativity. All of us who truly benefit from the practice you set out for us are sending love, gratitude  and positive vibes to you from all over the world (in my case Greece).

316.0,"Not to play devil's advocate but I'm not sure I understood the displeased reaction to ""people saying yoga camp is too easy"". It's completely true that Yoga Camp (which is pretty much a 30 Days of Yoga #2) is 'easier' than 30DoY2014. Here's why: Adriene mentioned in her intro video from the member platform (and probably on YT) that IN ADDITION to putting you in shape, this edition would be more inner growth oriented. While there are vinyasa sequences, most videos of YC are slow-paced, with longer periods on the ground, etc. Second reason is that IN COMPARISON with 30DoY2014, it is more about slowing down and challenging the mind rather than the body. And no, it doesn't mean the body is not challenged, it's just DIFFERENT. I have been a YWA adept since 2013 and it's true that this blend is more of the easy flow / gentle yoga variety of YWA. Which, I don't mind, I mix it with Empower videos or other flow videos. And, from my personal perspective (and I'm completely ok with voicing my opinion which doesn't equate to whining), Yoga Camp feels easier than Rise for instance; however, Rise tends to be more fitted to catering to the mind than Yoga Camp (don't know if that makes sense). I think it's due to the production of Rise (music, direction...). For those looking for an extra challenge (and it's okay, it doesn't mind you don't have a ""yoga mindset""...) but still in the tradition of body-mind balance, there's always Yoga with Lesley Fightmaster.

Today, I had people at home with me, which is not usual, and I had to choose to go with the noise, and embrace the toddler on my mat with me. Embrace life, accept what comes, create your own happiness (no matter what's going on around you), awaken your mind, body, and soul, stay present in life, trust that you've got this, be bold, know that you are capable of handling whatever comes your way, take support when its given, know that you are capable of going with the flow. Because you deserve to be content with your life and trust that there is always something better just around the corner (whether you think so or not). These mantras all add up to one amazing recipe for life. Being happy with who you are, and using that happiness to guide you through your days and all of the things you encounter.
