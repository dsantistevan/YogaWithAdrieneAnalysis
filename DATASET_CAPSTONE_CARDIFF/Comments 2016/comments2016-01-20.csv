73.0,"üëã Hello Adriene and friends! Man, this practice was extremely powerful (especially with the cumulative effects of daily practice). One of the things I started doing is reading the mantra for the following day's practice in advance, and let it sink into my mind like a fish hook to see what thoughts and feelings will emerge; this mantra caught a pretty heavy one.

When reading this mantra the night before, reverse psychology happened and I thought of the many times that I felt unworthy. And it totally sucked. It reminded me how we can do our best for some and it's never enough; on the other hand, the smallest gesture could mean the world to others. It's an odd feeling when the people we see often take us for granted, and it's easier to believe their criticism over the support of strangers that want you to succeed. I'm not sure, maybe at the end of the day none of it really matters if we derive our self-worth from within ourselves. 

I think doubting my own intuition and being around people who (unknowingly) worship their own suffering really made me disconnect with myself, and it manifested as me becoming more introverted, and then I used my newfound anxiety as a shield to avoid participating in things. But as time went on with daily yoga practice, the literal muscle knots in my back began to release and I don't feel like I have pressure in my throat anymore. And today, I could literally feel so much around my heart: when I put both hands over the center, and when I said out loud that ""I am worthy."" It's like I was melting away emotional blockages.

The more I've been reconnecting with myself, a LOT more synchronicity is happening. Which at first freaked me out, but then I realized that I'd become so accustomed to imbalance that balance seemed strange. Repeating numbers, thought and feeling synchronicities with you and some of the members--at first I thought these were coincidences, but repeating coincidences? Patterns, and they are usually significant.

So many thoughts to share. Anyways, I'll ""see"" you later today for heart chakra practice. Namaste üôè",UgwymdKFVD0Mi1VBZhN4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-12-19T15:27:45Z,-0.9798153638839722

215.0,"Hi everybody! ;-)

My experience with Yoga Camp thus far:

What have you noticed? I have noticed it's very helpful because after every session I feel better that before. So, for me it's my best medicine. I'm telling you :-)

What has been challenging? The biggest challenge was doing it every day because although I would like to do it sometimes I couldn't. I did not organise my time well but I'm trying my best... :)

What has felt GOOD? The stretchings and the deep breaths for me make a big difference. Thanks for this discovery :)

What is exciting? Feeling better after doing every Yoga Camp session.

What is boring? Maybe the repetitive postures.

What do you look forward to? To test myself if I will have the willpower to keep this habit in my life.

Favorite moment? When the session starts because I dedicate that time to myself and when it ends because I feel better.

Observations: I would suggest to explains the posture before doing it because sometimes I can't enjoy the posture / moment because I'm looking at the video to check how to do it.

A haiku? Not today :-P

Thanks for everything Adriene :-*  #yogacamp!",Ughl0rxmRBLIJXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-30T12:31:56Z,0.9348356127738953
