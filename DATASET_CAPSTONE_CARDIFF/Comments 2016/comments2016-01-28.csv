127.0,"Day 28 Check. 

So i still have flexibility issues, what a surprise. I'm sorry if the last few days I've been venting, but I'm going through some difficult times as I'm trying to improve myself. First off, I'm not a flexible guy-- I think I mentioned that days ago-- and because of that I am having serious problems keeping up with these forms. As I said yesterday, I was hoping by the end of this Yoga Camp, I'd improve but it's day 28 and I feel like I haven't improved at all. So once again, is there something wrong with me? Am I doing something wrong? I don't mean to be a jerk or anything, but I really want to improve, I'm passionate about this because I'm so tired of being just another average guy with no athletic skill and because of that I want to push myself as I promised for the New Years. So I would appreciate a reply, if possible Adriene. And I'm sorry if I seem like a difficult person to deal with.
