88.0,"This one just flew by! Loved it. Used my pink shiny left slipper for a prop. You were right, Adriene, while in the cow-legs pose, I really did start thinking about the things I need to release in my life to accommodate space for more goodness. And I was weirdly determined, almost aggressive, during some parts. Like, when I was committed to lying down from plank as slowly as possible (belly flops are a norm for me) and as I hopped to a plank (actually, twice in a row; just to show myself that I can). I definitely don't strive to be aggressive, but it's nice to know that I can fire up this side of me if it's necessary. And I was surprised to find that I could do the bind in the high lunge twist.

162.0,"Just after finishing this practice, i realized today marks 102 consecutive days of yoga for me. 
102 days, every day, you are a part of my life. I don't think i see my own roommate as often as i see you. XD 

i never even imagined i could do this. i started the first 30-day journey tentatively, to reestablish my relationship with self discipline. it used to be destructively intense, so i had let it go completely. 

i'm a freelancer and not a single day of my life is the same as the previous. and i love that - chaos defines me. but then i realized  in my fear of discipline, i was sabotaging myself, all because i had such bad memories of it. i used to wield it against myself like a punishment. 
i realized i was gonna have to learn to be a parent to myself in a way no one in my life had been. you know, a good parent. :P

your radical gentleness had me coming back to the mat every day with anticipation. i came to trust you to have my back...  and now i'm here - day 102, i didn't even notice the 100 mark go by... and coming to the mat every day has become EASY. i don't even have to think about it. dicipline doesn't feel so scary anymore, i know i can trust myself not to abuse myself with it. thank you for that. I am so grateful. your work is deeply meaningful to me.  

i wanted to tell you abt this session, RELEASE - I used it to release my last name. I'm a trans man, so i had to release my first name and choose a new one a while ago. but with time, i realized i needed a new last name, too. and i want to release the old one, and all the toxic things it means to me. my childhood, my father, who doesn't deserve anyone to carry on his name (my brother already changed his, years ago, i feel it's my time now). 

I've been looking for a new last name for a long time, and i can't seem to find one that speaks to me. but i neglected to examine the emotional connection i have with the name i've had all my life.

tonight i released the notion that i am bound to my past, that i have to keep carrying this name out of some misguided need to ""not forget where i came from"". as a reminder to humble myself before my own past. 
as i breathed, i remembered that change doesn't mean forgetting the past. that i can use that as a base, from which i build up into something new, something of my own. 

the psychology of transformation never ceases to fascinate me. 

Thanks for being part of my journey. 

Much love,
Bard.",UgwMrM-zENeMN6Yt1UZ4AaABAg,1.0,5.0,2019-12-22T05:11:41Z,0.02735119716821233

But I woke up, rolled out my mat anyways. I was thinking ""Release? Wish I could do that"". And Then. For the first time in 6 months of yoga practice. My heels touched the ground in downdog. I giggled like a kid! And you know what? Laughing really made me release my disapointment and sadness and everything. Life may have ups and downs, but yoga everyday has your back and helps you grow everyday.

164.0,"✔️ Hi Adriene and everyone! So I was thinking a lot about what to post today after practice, and then I realized I shouldn't think about it so much. Pretty much all of these posts are just my unfiltered thoughts and feelings I have on that day, and they are mostly subjective; and I appreciate having the space to share them!

I enjoyed the references and questions today, especially your first question for a scientist about whether or not we can send breath to the back of the body--I actually happen to work as an Industrial Chemist! So I got your back on the science. Baha, so to avoid going on a tangent, I'll try to keep my hypothesis simple as I can:

As we breathe in, we increase the internal pressure of our lungs. This in turn, decreases the internal pressure of the surrounding cell areas. Since most of our body is made up of water, it's easy for our body to balance out minute pressure differences by shifting around different pressures in our body. One good example of this is why we have the urge to pee more often when we're in a pool; the water surrounding our bodies reduces the affect of gravity on our blood cells, allowing them to flow more freely around our kidneys. Pressure of the outside water on the body thus decreases the pressure inside to match the external pressure and achieve equilibrium. So technically, we can breathe to different parts of the body if we consider the breath not just the inhale, but the simultaneous decrease of surroundings as well. 

As for the yoga prop, I used my turquoise yoga block. I release...my excessive self-consciousness by posting today :)

For just the duration of the side twists (smearing paint...painting a rainbow)...and about 15 minutes after...There was a small rainbow coming into my room somehow reflecting off of things onto my white door, where I had just ""painted a rainbow.""

It's been very heartbreaking to me, especially going through post partum anxiety and not having my best friend in my life. My husband and I are having our wedding reception this weekend and it's really bothered me that she will not be attending. For MONTHS I've had an internal dialogue with her, telling her how angry I am, how selfish and stupid I think she is, etc. Before coming to the mat yesterday I read that closure isn't always neat and perfect, and something changed with me during the practice yesterday. I was fully in tune to what was going on, I was releasing all the toxicity and all of my anger. I truly felt during the practice all of that negative energy leave my body with every exhale.

443.0,"Adriene, I watched this video this morning to start my day and afterwards I read my daily words of advice from an app called Transform Your Life. I found the words to be so fitting that I had to share. The universe always knows what you need! Thank you for having these videos for us to deepen or practice and our own awareness of what we need.

"" 'If you have always done it that way, it is probably wrong.' - Charles Kettering. So much of what we do is an unconscious, unexamined reaction to everything that has happened to us, especially in childhood. As we begin to wake up to the pain and suffering of rejections, disappointments, and hurts, it is tempting to find fault and assign blame. It is important to acknowledge what happened, but to stay stuck in the past simply destroys our present.

Assignment: Today recognize your conditioned reactions for what they are and remind yourself you can let them go.""",UghgNsojhyes2HgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-02-07T14:40:05Z,-0.8950430750846863

475.0,"Adriene, in this video you encouraged viewers to allow the breathe flow to different areas then asked if that is scientifically possible. I am a doctor of osteopathy (in short we study traditional western medicine but also more intensely study the body anatomy and physiology and how to use manual treatments to help our patients). To answer your question...yes it is possible, not just possible but normal for the breath to flow through the body. Our entire body should have normal motions with inspiration & expiration, it is through our poor postures, injuries, illnesses that this motion becomes limited. Yoga and manual therapies can certainly help restore those motions. 
I must say your videos are fantastic and thoroughly enjoy them. I love that you encouraged viewers to move/wiggle and focus on what they need that day.",UggTIUdiC8eJcHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-11-09T23:47:54Z,0.9950906038284302

It felt incredible to practice releasing these toxic thoughts and ridding myself of that which is no longer serving me. Thank you Adrienne! My prop was one of my fuzzy, leopard print slippers.

Your yoga practice is always such a validating experience for me and I have such a great appreciation for how accepting you are of wherever we may be in yoga at any time.

869.0,"So as I was doing this sequence I was releasing, letting go of expectstions, fears, and insecurities. I was mostly thinking about things that had happened recently, and letting those go. Then I rolled my way up and grabbed my prop right after you said to (it was a book, because my room is covered in them). Then I just sat there, watching you patiently wait for others to grab their props and I felt like I was there with you. I felt like I could suddenly feel the love and compassion and joy pouring off of you. 

Then, suddenly, out of the blue I started crying. I had to pause the video for a minute. Last May a dear, amazing, loving, and beautiful friend of mine took her own life. I love her so much and I miss her desperately. I carry a lot of guilt, thoughts like ""I should have known"" and ""if I had just been there more for her, if I had just shown her how much I love her."" I don't like when people try and say things to take that guilt away. That isn't fair, because it's my own grief and my own struggles of love that I go through. If I didnt, I wouldn't understand this love. So I have been carrying my guilt. I know it isn't right, or even honest, and I know that one day (or at least hope) I will be able to let it go completely and at the end it will just be my love for her, and nothing else. But that's my own journey and I'm taking it. 

Except today, suddenly, when I came up from that roll and just watched you smiling and enjoying life it washed up onto me. Now there is a little hole, a tiny drain that may be slow and clogged, but it is there. For the first time today I really felt a little of the release of that guilt, and I wasn't even trying for that. 

Thank you, Adriene. Thank you so much. I know you hear it often but please, know and understand that every day you are affecting people like this. Today, at the very least, you helped me grow a little lighter, a little brighter in a way that I didn't think anyone could. I don't think words can really convey how much that means to me. But I hope you read this, I hope you can at least kind of get it. You are truly, completely wondrous.

It was hard to read and confusing from time to time trying to follow you.  I understand that it is time consuming to work on adding subtitles to your videos.

I never thought yoga would be for me, (not the strongest or fittest person - definitely not flexible at all!) but these videos and Adrienes teaching style have changed my life. I feel better in every aspect of myself; mentally stronger, physically stronger and much more mindful and physically aware, and the best bit of all; my back pain has eased, which nothing has ever been able to do up until this point.
 I just wanted to say if you feel like giving up at any point - stick with it, it is so worth it. Thank you Adriene! (this is also my first ever youtube comment!)",UgjFEgI1F-D8vXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-15T14:21:21Z,0.9971635937690735
955.0,"First of all I want to thank you for what you are doing for us. Again.
I like how my mood and needs match with your camp's mantra
But I really would like to release this cause it's getting annoying.

I don't want to sound hating. But can you create a SPACE for us? Space with silence for OUR thoughts and feeling.
It's seems like you try to fill each second of the practice with your voice and unfortunately not all that you said add value to the practice. I assume it's because you are the child yogi from the start and you have to keep their attention all the time. 
But this camp is for adults mostly. And it's working differently.
I do realise that it's your style. But can you please-please-please at least consider this thought that maybe spice girls, knoking to heavens door and other references are just not fit in. If you have something to say important for us - say it and not murmuring something unrelevant disturbing our concentration. Just a little bit.
Thank you in advance.

1029.0,"I used my ""Inside Out"" DVD for my prop today. Obsessed with that movie!

I'm a choir director, and you're right, technically the air you inhale doesn't go anywhere except your lungs. But as a teacher, I say things like ""breathe into your toes,"" ""expand your ribs,"" or ""fill up your whole belly with air"" all the time, and it seems to help my students release the tension in their vocal mechanism, lowering the larynx, and relax the tongue and shoulders. When breathe fully while doing yoga, I can feel that release of tension in the pose or stretch, and my body moves as it is meant to. I've also started studying Alexander technique, and it goes hand-in-hand with my own vocal technique, my teaching, and yoga practice.",UghjKUkuyuQivXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-13T16:58:57Z,0.9985878467559814
