I returned gifts, rejected parties and sat at home waiting for friends and family to forget. The wounded child inside could not be happy with anything anyone tried to do for me, and did not deserve to be noticed and loved. But today, I choose to celebrate. I choose to be kind to myself, to recognize growth instead of  my flaws. I choose to love the bundle of purple balloons my husband got for me and to buy myself a gift. I choose to do yoga at home in jammies all day and enjoy my flexibility, instead of feeling like a loser for not currently having a job. I choose to see myself as stronger and wiser then I was a year ago, not the same 'unchanged ' girl with her list of unattained dreams. I choose to see myself as a good mom and a great person.
