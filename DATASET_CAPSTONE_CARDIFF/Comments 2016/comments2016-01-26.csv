46.0,"üß† Law of attraction is where it's at man. It's so powerful. It's unfortunate that the law of attraction has attracted so much criticism based on the incomplete teachings of many self proclaimed gurus or masters that make it seem so mystical and abstract. So many get let down by these ""enlightened individuals"" who are more snake oil salesman than human beings. But the way you presented here is both encouraging and helpful to so many, and I feel like this discussion/flow is eternally beneficial to anyone who want at least an ideas of what the essence of attraction is.

As Descartes said: ""I think, therefore I am."" Most of our thoughts are repetitive patterns of the same thing each day, and even most of those thought are trivial thoughts. But what we think about often is what we become. I attract what I think about the most because I become that myself.

This is the best way to do all these poses. Loved how you started off with the Kundalini poses, The churning or grinding of the milk pose. Then the sphinx. I never liked them. But it felt so good and natural today. I was shocked by how much I enjoyed it.  I so was hoping you would do the Nataraja (Lord Shiva's dance) pose (The arms and legs stretched out) and YOU did.  The ending was the best. Truly loved the flow. Just had me in my happy dance. Thank you! I hope you will do some Kriya in the near future...:-D I so look forward to this and have not missed a day.

I have been doing your videos for months now and I'm finally doing them nearly every day! Today I did yoga camp day 25 & 26 back to back; while resting in shzivashana, the brightest most beautiful sun shone through rain clouds (literally it's been storming where I live). It felt as though God herself/himself/the universe or whatever you may believe in were directly sending me light and healing energy/power. It was so fitting and symbolic of my yoga journey. It was exactly what I needed today. I'm an actress who's in the process of relocating to LA and it hasn't been easy; however, in this moment I felt such a strong sense of joy, gratitude and love so I wanted to share it with all of you and THANK YOU ADRIENE for serving as a catalyst in my healthy yogi journey.

277.0,"When we were together over Christmas, my sister convinced me to do your Yoga Camp along with her even though we live no where near one another. I love to run and though I always loved the IDEA of yoga, I never found it particularly worthwhile for myself. These past 26 days have been a struggle for me. My yoga practice was always kind of mashed in somewhere and then I still felt rushed, my brain never for one second really shutting up. I got grumpy when we moved into positions I didn't like or struggled to hold. I faithfully did every single day, but it wasn't something I was really looking forward to, but another thing I HAD to do. 

All that being said, today's practice might have been something of a breakthrough for me. I feel like the 40 minutes were over as soon as they started. I focused on my breathing. I laughed when my cat ran into my face as I stretched. I enjoyed every stretch. I balanced and fell and balanced more. I'm not sure what was different, but today felt absolutely fantastic and I wanted to tell you that. Thank you. I'm hoping this is a change that can last, hoping my brain will continue to allow me to really experience everything these videos offer.

Sometimes I get so caught up in doing yoga as a workout that I forget to breathe and connect to my mind too so these thirty day programs you have created really help bring me back to it and force me to focus.
