As I said in a previous installment in the series, I couldn't do situps as a kid and monkey bars were a no-go. I didn't know why that was and thought I was just weird until I started working out at a boxing gym in high school (I will be 25 on October 19th, 2020). WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY CORE, ADRIENE? You must have added a lot of ""sneaky"" core moves when I was trying to get the other poses down. Now core exercises are starting to become...enjoyable? I'm 98% sure this is the best shape my core has ever been. Even when I was working out constantly at the gym, I look back and realize that I hadn't been giving my weak core the TLC it so desperately needed.

63.0,"üí™ Hello friends! I wanted to share something that has really helped me during my yoga practices: sometimes for me, many powerful emotions surface during practice that can be overwhelming to deal with. I¬†have a tendency¬†to get so into my own head and judge myself (like I did when I had difficulty doing the asanas last month) that I just want to quit¬†and disappear because I feel so icky and unworthy; it's almost like I don't want people to see me in this vulnerable and human state. But I realize that I need to own my feelings and be accountable for myself to and my feelings.

Today, one of my friends invited me to join her and her husband to read Christmas stories to kids at a coffee shop, and it was really cool to just hang out with them and be silly with the kids. It turned into a¬†nice good vibe sesh that was much needed, and so many hours passed by quickly. The biggest difference I noticed¬†during this hang¬†out¬†versus previous ones was my heart chakra:¬†it felt like a furnace of intense Leo fire that was coursing through my center! I could literally feel the prana flowing, and ""fire"" coursing through my heart center¬†(especially with the recent practices). I¬†also felt¬†that my connection to my friends¬†was a lot stronger, because the connection to myself is stronger. 

It also feels kinda crazy that this rebirth of my fire energy happened on a Winter Solstice, which I think is symbolic for the Sun's rebirth and renewal? I'm not sure entirely, but the synchronicity is just so insane. By the time I got home and rolled out the yoga mat, I layed down on it and just KO-ed from¬†all the interaction today; it's ironic that going out helps me process energy released from mat practice, but mat practice helps me ground out energy absorbed from¬†being out with people. Maybe this will change as I continue to grow as a person. But fortunately for¬†home practice,¬†I¬†can attend even if¬†it's¬†2AM. Baha!

Today was intense in good ways, and this journey can be difficult but enlightening. I'm grateful for you, and grateful for renewal. I am secure within my skin. Namaste üôè",UgwB4fjcxgeTdRFZK5R4AaABAg,0.0,4.0,2019-12-22T14:50:35Z,0.987863302230835

I have to say having maintained a consistent practice with Adriene between May and October (2019) helped me to weather an unstable November. Even during the days I did not make it to the mat, and there were a number of them last month, I managed to remain fairly calm.

68.0,"Well I have to admit it took me a while today to seize the affirmation...
‚ÄúI am secure‚Äù
Am I ?
‚ÄúI feel secure‚Äù
Do I ?
Is not that I don‚Äôt want, but I don‚Äôt tend to. Consciously I want to, but sub-consciously I‚Äôm more (or I used to be more) the kind of person that freak out about things and how they could go wrong, being anxious about what will be, always thinking about the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù...
And then your calm, the practice, the safe environment, breathing deep inside, the sun rising, everything became clear, such an epiphany...
How much time have I spent worrying about things and how they could get wrong anytime rather then enjoying the ride???
How could I be that person???
‚ÄúEveryone down to extended child pose‚Äù, you said.
And there I am: a child again.
And children feel secure, they are secure, because we parents are there for them to be secure.
What changes in adult life? Or better, why things should change in adult life?
I want my children to feel secure, to be secure, and for that I have to be secure myself.
And I have not a single one acceptable reason not to be secure.
So it‚Äôs now 11 hours past the daily mat, and I eventually seized my mantra.
‚ÄúI can be secure‚Äù
And it will feel good
Namaste üôè

The only problem I have, is with twists and sometimes lying on my tummy. I feel like I can't breath if something is kinda pressing against my chest or tummy - or both. It feels like it sometimes blocks my ability to breath deeply and then I start panicking since I've had asthma when I was younger and I've recently had some anxiety related issues where breathing has become somewhat a problem. 
Does anyone know why this could be? Because I physically feel like the pressure is blocking my breathing, it doesn't start as something mental, I think.",UgiTV3Fs8MsbgXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-02-23T09:34:05Z,-0.9986030459403992

I've been doing this yoga camp for a while and I enjoy it very much but I think I fucked up my lower back somehow and my lumbar hernia is back. I mean it's been always there and my right upper leg was always somewhat numb but now my left upper leg also hurts a lot (as if it's an electric shock). It's not that I forced myself beyond my limits or I felt a sharp pain during the exercises. No, I think it built up as I kept doing it regularly. In general, I love your channel and yoga camps and I don't want to give up on them but can you also prepare some videos or exercise series for us with lumbar hernia? Or when you prepare such camp videos in the future, can you tell us the poses to avoid for lumbar hernia patients? Or separate videos for lumbar hernia would also be appreciated.

271.0,"This was one of the challenging mantra's for me. I have been super busy this january, so I missed a few days (subbed it with some short freestyling), but these mantra's are really helping me to challenge my outlook and thinking about how I view myself. It's a beautiful thing, how a word or sentence can have that effect. I'm catching up on the ones I missed and I think I will return to yoga camp many times.
