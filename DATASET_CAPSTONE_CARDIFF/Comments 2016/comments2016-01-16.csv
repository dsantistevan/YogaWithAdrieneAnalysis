It was hard for me to internalize the mantra until I got towards the twists at the end, and I was like ""heck yeah this is nice. I enjoy this."" And while the video ended in shavasna, the Youtube autoplay started another one of your videos, ""Yoga For Loneliness.""

take the day off and resume  practice tmw; no harm, no foul.  Yoga and meditation are tools  I use to expand my perception, calm my mind, ""Find my chill,""ect.

The Universe is me.
A bird sings.
It is me.

Doing nothing.

Breathing gently.

321.0,"Yoga Camp has been really helpful for me so far. Having a daily practice and a community to keep up with has helped me re-engage with my self-care practice. I've already achieved so much this month that I wouldn't have been able to even a few weeks ago and I think having some time to engage my mind, spirit and body has really helped with that. I've noticed the positive in things more frequently, feel lighter and I'm beginning to become a bit more assertive. I wasn't expecting to feel more comfortable with saying ""no"" and removing people and things from my life which bring me disrespect and negativity. I am realising that by spending more time doing yoga and focusing on the positive I don't need to carry around fear, shame or judgement (from myself or others) when I want to remove myself from a situation which doesn't add anything useful/positive to my life. I'm more self-accepting and ""Find What Feels Good"" has become a mantra of mine. I love the support I feel from this community and remembering the people out there offering support has even helped me sleep better!

383.0,"#yogacamp my journey so far - day 16. I will share part of my daily journal entry. These past 16 days have not only improved my yoga practice - gained strength, discipline, and awareness - but by incorporating the daily mantras I have become aware of thoughts, worries, stresses, and joy that gets buried under daily life. Very often I would come up with my mantra for the day only to have more meaningful and often surprising words come during the practice. This often led me to acknowledge issues I needed to celebrate, work on or let go! Namaste Adriene - thank you for this journey! I am looking forward to the next two weeks!",UggOSRn5X7360HgCoAEC,0.0,11.0,2016-01-17T14:41:37Z,0.9989036321640015
