47.0,"Today I realized that by sticking to these daily practices I can already see progress in two things that I had not much improvement doing yoga once or twice a week for the past two years. 1- my shoulder mobility: before I started yoga camp, I wouldn't even dare to try a reverse namaste or any shoulder binding because my right shoulder just wouldn't allow it. Now, I still struggle to get to the reverse namaste, but once I get it, the stretch feels so good. 2- Whenever I had to go from down-dog to low-lunge, I was never able to launch my step forward in just one try, I'd go halfway and then would have to lead my foot the rest of the way with my hands. Now I can do it most of the time, especially after warming up. Realizing these small accomplishments make me want to keep going :)",Ugz2D2KbtuIH7cL1K_94AaABAg,0.0,9.0,2019-11-20T15:13:05Z,0.9822631478309631

49.0,"Wonderful practice!! I love the mantras,  and RESPECT is a key area of focus in my life right now. I could finish the phrase a myriad of ways. One way that really resonated with me at the end of practice is ""I respect my journey of growth and development."" I often feel very discouraged over my failings and shortcomings. But Jesus said we are ""little children"" and ""cannot bear all things now,"" and our development is truly the work of a lifetime. For whatever reason, I flail trying to balance on one leg and opposite arm (on all fours). And, though some may be appalled, I paused briefly with about 5 minutes remaining so I could take 3 swigs of diet soda (and spritz my face and change a band aid) because I needed a teeny boost. I'm so very grateful for these videos and for you sharing your time and energy so freely. Also appreciate the drawing together of people all over the world into a compassionate experience.

71.0,"I enjoyed todays practice, it was a good one for just before bed.  However, I do have to say that yoga camp is a challenge for me because I just dont connect with the whole mantra thing.  It can get frustrating for me when youre talking about the mantra and I just want to move on to the next thing or to just sit quietly.   My biggest struggle everyday is to not let that get to a negative point of annoyance.  Its a struggle I definitely dont succeed with a lot.  Today I succeeded....most of the time.

111.0,"Completing the first affirmation of this practice shocked me.I said I respect my choices. It genuinely came so quickly it was as if it was from my subconscious. I tried to understand why. I became emotional when I realised it was because I have made a lot of difficult decisions recently not only affecting my life but other peoples as well. The uncertainty and guilt still becomes overwhelming. I got emotional because really I'm still coming to terms with them and saying I respect them or myself is hard. Throughout the practice I reminded myself why I've made those decisions and although I ended with the respect affirmation, I chose to say out loud I trust.....myself, my friends, my family, my life. It was after this I could then actually say without feeling sad, I respect myself. 
I really can't tell you Adriene how much you and yoga has helped me this last year. It really has kept me alive, grounded and happy.

I have a funny story! I did Yoga Camp Day 19 this morning and I literally sneezed at the exact same time you did on the video. I laughed for about a minute strait ! You said It was your first time sneezing on video too and it was definitely my first time sneezing during yoga. Funny chuckle for the day. Its definitely allergy season out here in Colorado as I'm sure it is in Austin in this Spring time. Loved the practice today! I feel my body is very well respected. Thanks so much! Cheers!

I finally plucked up the courage to RESPECT my body and go grab a snack. I paused the video, ate, then got back to it. It felt really empowering to do that.

Idk what happened other then just a build of negative energy at how some people don't think about/respect anything other then themselves.
