Anyways friends, you should definitely check out the yoga practices on YWA and suppirt. I think having artist friends really helped me realize that the best way to seem more of what we love in the world is to support it, so that there can be more of it.

156.0,"Hey Ardiene! This wasn't the first time I started crying during the excersize and I felt I need to tell this. I love your yoga lessons, this is the second 30 days of yoga list of yours I'm going throug. I started doing yoga first and foremost to feel better physically since I've stopped other excersices and sports because of plenty of reasons and I have some pain and I feel that doing yoga at home is the only suitable excersice for me right now. Your yoga movements are also very gentle. The second reason is that yoga is calming down since I'm going through a tuff time in my life. I try to take it as a quality time for myself and focusing on something else than the bad stuff that usually fills my mind. I really appreciate your lessons, your calmness, your effort, I like your voice and ways of telling that every one should listen to their own body and mood. And I know these mantras are to help people, I do know that. Usually, I personnaly don't feel they are for me, and I skip thinking them, but sometimes I play along as much I can. But SOMETIMES, they are too much for me. ""I believe"". I feel really bad that right now I've got nothing I could say I believe in. I'm going through a depression and everything is crushing. I just try to find a way to survive even if there is not that many things I can count on. I just can't relate to that. Once, you said that we should love our feet, look at them and love the way they are. I know that would be great, but I just couldn't. Doing yoga itself makes me feel better in my body, step by step. But when some one, smile on her face, tells me I should look at my feet and love them, I just couldn't and I felt bad that I couldn't and even then, started to cry and had to stop that excersice. I know that the most of this is in my head and my own problems. I think that there are a lot of depressed people that do your yoga and might feel the same, maybe not, maybe it's just me. I just wanted to tell this, that the mantras maybe don't always bring only positivity. But well, I love your yoga otherwise and anyway, hope this will not bring you down too much! Keep going and do what you feel best! Best wishes, Hilla from Finland, the land of negativity and depression. ;)",Ugz1dnxZ77KgnkNtKsN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-06T19:33:25Z,-0.09370991320147476

164.0,"Adrienne, I was going to write something meaningful, straight from the heart, but instead I will write the following: all through the practice which was infused with a wonderful silliness, at least for me, the song “we belong“ by Pat Benatar kept running through my head... I never comment on YouTube vids, But all through practice, I couldn’t wait to post the pat Benatar song which by that time, I was certain it was called “we believe”!
LAM (Laughing At Myself; is that a “thing“? If not, it certainly should be; I do it constantly! Thank you for recalibrating my compass, so to speak. I thought I wanted to get thinner, turns out I just want to get stronger. As physically strong as I can possibly be. And proud. I recently had a tumor removed, surgeon told me no yoga/no swimming for two weeks. (Thanks Doc, had I known that I probably would’ve left the damn tumor in there!)

223.0,"So I feel compelled to tell you this. I started yoga awhile back wanting to do something for my back. Me and the wife started with your 30 day yoga challenge. After that we started yoga camp. Not everyday but I tried to do at least 4-5 days a week. And it helped my back and made me feel better as a whole. I usually got a chuckle from your hippie mantras and some of the things you said. Then my world changed. Out of the blue my wife went to nights followed by being told I was getting divorced. But I kept doing the yoga, since it helped my back. Then one day I repeated the mantra and adding the word happiness. I deserve happiness, I believe in happiness, so on and so on. So now, I do the yoga for back pain, overall better body feeling and in a strange hippy way my emotional and spiritual well being. As close to spiritual as I can get. I just want to say thanks for helping me get through this rough part of my life. Keep making videos, I will keep doing yoga.",UgxgNbZ4UiAARoMM5SV4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2018-01-22T00:51:26Z,0.9968397617340088

I hope that you can help me with a problem that I am currently facing with the warrior pose. I am suffering from a lot of pain in my right knee when that leg is back, due to the twist. It is making me very stressed, and a bit demotivated to practice. I was hoping that you could suggest an alternative to the warrior pose so that I don't feel like I am slacking when I miss out this pose when it comes up in the video.
Your help is much appreciated, and keep up that British accent that often slip into your videos :))))

My favourite song with the words ""I believe"" (in abundance, might I add), is Affirmation by Savage Garden. :)

""I believe that beauty magazines promote low self-esteem
I believe I'm loved when I'm completely by myself alone
I believe in Karma what you give is what you get returned""

""I believe your most attractive features are your heart and soul
I believe that family is worth more than money or gold""

Rather suitable for the 30 Days of Yoga, don't you think? :)

607.0,"Not a song but a part of a Poem from a Costarrican Poet named Jorge Debravo

I BELIEVE
I believe in freedom despite the traps,
Despite fences fields.

I believe in peace, beloved, despite bombs
And despite helmets.

I believe countries will be one place
of Love for men despite the covenants,
Despite the limits, the consuls,
Despite free people that think they are slaves.

And I believe in love, this love of steel
That will strengthen the legs and arms,
Working in secret,
Hidden from hatred and scorn,
That under the suit muscle becomes,
Body experience, nerve ganglion
Despite the bitterness that overwhelms us
The heart of birds funerals.

I believe in love more than in in my eyes
And more than in power and enthusiasm.

---
CREO

Creo en la libertad a pesar de los cepos,
A pesar de los campos alambrados.

Creo en la paz, amada, a pesar de las bombas
Y a pesar de los cascos.

Creo que los países serán un solo sitio
De amor para los hombres a pesar de los pactos,
A pesar de los límites, los cónsules,
A pesar de los libres que se dan por esclavos.

Y creo en el amor, en este amor de acero
Que va fortaleciendo las piernas y los brazos,
Que trabaja en secreto,
A escondidas del odio y del escarnio,
Que debajo del traje se hace músculo,
Órgano, experiencia, nervio, ganglio,
A pesar del rencor que nos inunda
El corazón de funerales pájaros.

Yo creo en el amor más que en mis ojos
Y más que en el poder y el entusiasmo.",UggF_K48H7Q5mngCoAEC,2.0,78.0,2016-01-23T13:09:51Z,0.9946815371513367
