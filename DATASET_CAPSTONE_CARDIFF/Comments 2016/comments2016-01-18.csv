7.0,"I feel like I connected to myself in a very Spiritual way in this practice. I always hear people talk about their Spiritual experiences with yoga, but today was the first time I really felt connected to that and finally understood what it meant, at least to me in my own way. 

Also, I'm not sure if this is a circulation thing,  the blood rushing to my limbs, or maybe it's that flow of energy as you might say, but I get soft, tingly sensations in my legs, feet, and arms every now and then. It doesn't feel uncomfortable like anything is getting pinched or cut off, but it's an interesting feeling that I've noticed for the past little while. It only started happening a few months into my practice. I've tried looking into it, but haven't found much so far, so was wondering if there was anyone else who maybe experienced similar sensations as this during your practice? If so, what did you make of it?",Ugw-NiEDzKT_kQbvx6N4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-09-03T10:16:09Z,0.9896236062049866

62.0,"üôå I surrender to the pain. Rumi once said that ""the cure for the pain is within the pain.""  The more we resist suffering, the more difficult it becomes; but if we develop the strength to be with it, the suffering that most people try to run away from becomes a valuable guide or teacher. 

I have to remember that every antidote is created from the poison itself; that healing feeling so great because pain is so intense. My relationship with yoga, as with many in the community commenting here began with pain. In a way, suffering was a guide that lead me here when I realized I needed to be more accountable to my health. That no matter how terrible the situation, I have to keep going.

Pain is a friend that has joined me on the mat each day (whether emotional or physical) and each day he time I spend with it melts it away gradually like a masseuse working out a back knot.

152.0,"This was a difficult one for me. I am fighting a depression and right now ""I surrender"" sounds too much like ""I give up"" which is what I'm trying not to do. In the ""I choose"" video I chose help, accepted that I need it and I have now registered for counselling. So surrendering to the fact that I can't fight this alone didn't seem like a new sentiment to me, I've already come to terms with this. I really struggled to fight something to surrender to. Maybe I am too stubborn! And a perfectionist. How do you surrender in this video, guys?",Ugi_EfF8vzd7RHgCoAEC,2.0,2.0,2016-12-05T11:07:16Z,-0.9938498139381409
