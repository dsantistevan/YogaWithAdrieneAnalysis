Revolution practice - I fell back in love with yoga
Dedicate - my body felt more at ease and I tuned into listening to my breathe more
True - I flowed intuitively, closing my eyes. I spiritually opened up and emotions came through
Yoga Camp - I've only started, but I already feel its aligned because of where my journey is taking me.

80.0,"Hello Adriene - or anyone who knows about yoga in detail, I have had arthritis in my right big toe joint for a year or so - and I can manage downward dog or any toe to floor positions - but i have to have the ball of my foot all on the ground and the foot is almost all touching the floor - which is oik but if I put trainers on - I feel there is much more rounded motion and better support all round. But- it doesn't feel good for a lot of postures and I feel that grounded balance feeling isn't being utilised very well. Do you have any experience with this in other people? as it is a very common ailment. I'm gonna wear trainers for my 30 days of yoga journey but as I say I'm quite unsure if that's the best option. thanks x",Ugxm96ZlcWQ8kVJqEJJ4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-01-09T16:21:10Z,-0.998105525970459

This daily yoga helps very well to become more flexible. To give an example I can now put my feet flat on the floor with downwart dog. My yoga posture sukhasana has also improved enormously. My left leg and shoulder are still a bit stiffer than on the right, but since I discovered 30 days of yoga my body feels better and better. Two years ago I followed it for a few months. Almost no yoga for a year after that. But now for almost three consecutive months and I miss it when I can't find time on the weekends. The five days of yoga in the week has given my life a lot.

145.0,"Just a quick note of thanks—once again you have me laughing, with you, and at myself—and it's true what you say about there being so many things to think about. Then I had the mental image of an acrobat spinning plates and my body simply found the adjustments that were necessary, that it had taken into memory from the previous two months we spent together. And as if by magic, your voice always directing me to a place where I can release, or a place that I might need to engage, be mindful of.
You are irreverent and silly, caring and wise. And I look forward to each day of these practices you've shared.

309.0,"I'm probably the only guy on here, but regardless.  I'm about 90 lbs overweight, and in horrible physical shape, yet I am something of an oddity in that I have a good amount of mental stamina left over from my time in the military.  So I'm more capable than most people who are in as poor of shape as I am.

I started doing this camp to try and lose some weight, since as a stay at home dad, I'm a little bit limited on the exercises that I can do.  My belly and thighs get in the way of a lot of the stretches, but today is the first day that I felt like I had exerted myself, and could feel it in my gluts and upper thighs.  I still haven't broken a sweat, but I'm hoping that will change soon.

377.0,Just finished Day 3 and loving it!!! But I am beginning to get some tension and pain in my knees from being on all fours so much. I grew up with knee problems and going from all fours on the balls of my feet to the tops of my feet takes some serious reworking. Do you have any suggestions as far as ways to distribute some weight off of them or do the moves without changing that so much?Thanks!,UgjB7y48_vzI0XgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-03-05T23:49:59Z,0.5326840281486511

I pushed myself and it was great. I feel committed and ready.

I started the 30 day camp this Monday and really enjoyed the first 3 days, but sadly I've had to stop. Wednesday night I got so sick and pretty much haven't improved since (it's now Saturday night). I never ever ever get sick, like seriously never, so I'm assuming the yoga practice has managed to stir up some nasties in my body and I'm going through a detox. Is this possible? Or common? I'm also experiencing pretty intense radiating pain down my hip/butt/thigh, which is painful to the touch. Is that normal? I haven't exercised in a while so I'm not too surprised ha.

504.0,"Last year I tried your 30 days of yoga videos and quit because they were too easy (not to say there wouldn't have in reality been good emotional and physical reasons to stick with it). However, in September I had a closed head injury leading to three weeks unconscious plus Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after an infection caused by swallowing some vomit into my lungs after the accident so about two months in bed all and all and another few weeks in inpatient rehabilitation. I lost all the strength and flexibility I took for granted before the accident and had to learn to walk again. This has been really really perfect for where I'm at right now... What before my accident the jerk in me would have said was too easy to bother with is now sometimes a little on the hard side, but you do a good of giving alternatives that I am able to do. Since you not the kind of instructor who is constantly saying one should just stick with it even if it's hard I don't feel as bad and frustrated when I have to take a break as I might otherwise. I am really grateful for having this to do as part of my recovery. I hope if I do get the strength and flexibility back I used to have (which may or may not happen) I'm smart enough to stick with some yoga that isn't just about the physical, this is helping rebuild my emotional strength as well.",UghCkgtsVedEJngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-15T03:23:17Z,0.9859195947647095

Sometimes it's difficult though but I think that the best thing to do is to overcome them by accepting and embracing patiently that moment, and creating love  and compassion towards me or whatever situation I'm in.For those other Yoga fellas and gals campers, keep that good work and if you feel frustrated, just remember that you're not the only ones and that that frustration can be overcome.Namaste :D",UggUJVWt-CYBGngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-06T14:17:40Z,0.9990445971488953

699.0,"#YogaCamp <3 I am in love! I have tried time and time again through the years to establish a yoga practice. Some classes simply intimidated me; other videos at home did the same. Finding Yoga with Adriene has been such a blessing. I found last year's 30 Day Challenge ten days ago and began it immediately to kick start my new year's resolution to learn and practice mindfulness.  It is now my morning routine and I accepted the Yoga Camp challenge and added it nightly three days ago! Maybe I am an overachiever, but the more time I devote in my day to yoga, the better I feel! Adriene, you are a beautiful spirit and excellent teacher. In my 27 years, I've never been able to joyfully make it to a consistent week+ of ANY exercise for my body. Your positive energy absolutely radiates acceptance and my 2016 is already very enriched by your wisdom through this awesome community! (Whew, what a rant!)
