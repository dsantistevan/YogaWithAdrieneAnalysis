27.0,"I came from the 30 days of yoga series. I spent a few days in between just doing yoga for my hips as they were bugging me, but missed the variety these little 30 day challenges bring. I was trying to decide which challenge to do, and yoga camp frightened me in particular because of day 2, 50 minutes of yoga. In 30 days of yoga I found I got to a point where I thought way too much about ""how much time is left"", but I think yesterday ""accepting"" that time was a factor, and accepting that I had to move past that, I got through today with ease. I believe I checked the time stamp twice, not necessarily to see 'how much time is left?' but how much time had passed as I was shocked that I was able to think so little about it. 
I'm very proud of myself for this, and just wanted to share just incase anyone else might be a bit fearful over the time stamp on this practice. Once it is out of your mind, it will fly by. Enjoy the moments as they come.",UgyK4ipkOJqo9NbelW54AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2021-05-15T02:06:47Z,-0.9597427845001221

In terms of yoga, I am really beginning to notice a yoga 'personality'. Sometimes I come to the mat and feel playful, like today, and I was recognising that I didn't need some of the child pose rests and so adapted it to what I did need. Others, I am there to relax or to switch off. I enjoy the practice so much, and I really could have done this for hours today to begin with, but as the practice went on I became relaxed, content and sleepy - it's 11:30pm here, so I will be going to sleep now :) I have also learnt a lot about myself. When I come to the mat, I truly check in with myself and reflect on how I am *actually* feeling. I have realised that so often I have convinced myself to feel a way that others would want me to feel, or that I think I should feel or would be expected to feel. Through yoga, I have learnt how I really do feel and have learnt a lot about myself through this.

But it's so true that we often forget to ""own it."" In the context of practice (or even extended to life): we are where we are, and we begin where we are; so why not have fun and create joy where we are? It can be so easy to forget why we started doing something if our reason is somewhat superficial. I started yoga for many deeper reasons that help me go through and enjoy the practices each day. I still have days where I'll lose sight of the focus, feel kinda challenged, feel overwhelmed--feel human--but that reminds me that this is why it's called daily practice.

I usually do 2 videos at a time with adriene as with 1 i don't feel stretched enough, i very much welcome longer videos, to improve my stamina :)

In the fall of 2017, my body was in the worst shape ever due to a traumatic experience that lead me to rely on alcohol for about 3 years. I was desperate to change everything, so I relocated myself to a totally different place and retired. Even after I moved, I still had very bad back pain, so one day I googled ""yoga for back pain"" and that was my first day of yoga. I felt better and better every time I would do it, so I ended up doing yoga for about half an year, 3~4 times a week. I really felt like I was a different person. But reality came back to me and I got lazy, I did not need to do yoga because my body did not hurt anymore. Couple of days ago, I felt a cramp in my back and it made me so scary at first. But I knew where to go and have came back to ""Yoga Camp."" It is only my second day, but it is a great to come back and re-experience the small but amazing changes in my body. I am so grateful to you and all the efforts you put into these unbelievable contents. Thank you.",UgwJ7mtpducG1wu7e3N4AaABAg,0.0,5.0,2019-04-02T06:02:06Z,0.9762828350067139

334.0,"Hey Adriene (and any other experiences yogis out there), I have a question.
I have one leg that is shorter than the other. The difference is around 1.7cm or two thirds of an inch, and usually when I'm wearing shoes I balance it out by wearing a little wedge type thing underneath my left heel (the shorter leg). However when I'm doing yoga barefoot I can definitely feel some imbalance in my hips, and I was wondering whether you would recommend maybe wearing shoes with the little lift in them to balance things out during my practice as well or whether you think I should just disregard the imbalance. I'm mostly worried about it having an impact on strength and flexibility in one side compared to the other.

416.0,"Dear Adrienne, 
I'm kinda disappointed in mysef.
I'm 14 and I'm very out of shape and slightly overweight, and my mom recommended that I try yoga to get back in shape, because I'm already very flexible. I successfully did yoga camp day one and had one very productive day. The next day however, I got up very early, ready to try my new routine again until my phone broke. I dropped it to which it shattered an became covered in dead pixels. I then retreated to my bed to watch lets plays and vloggers to keep from crying. The next day I was extremely guilty, but I had accidentally slept in til incredibly late, so I barely had a day to be awake to do anything. Then yesterday, I woke up late once again and this time tried to stay up late enough and eventually do yoga at 2:00 in the morning, but I fell asleep building up the courage. Now it's 1:25 am and I'm wide awake about to finally start day two. Any advice for finally clicking play on the video and ignoring the timestamp? Should I be even be doing this this late in the first place, or should I just go to sleep? I really love your videos and I really appreciate your channel.

417.0,"It's kind of amazing how each of these themes coordinates to what's happening in my life. Day 1- I Embrace: I decided to catch up on the details of the news and found myself extremely angry and I could let it fester but with this I decide to embrace that I do feel negative emotions but using them I can affect positive change. Day 2- I Create: My boyfriend is a programmer and is always creating games and he asked me to create a sprite for his newest game. Usually I shy away from creating things for anyone other than myself because I fear disappointment. However, knowing I create good artwork that my boyfriend loves enough to want to use in something he creates is helping me through that.

Maybe deep in our subconscious some of us feel like we dont deserve so much time focused completely on ourselves. ... or were worried about hurts and fears burried deep rising to the surface, to our attention... self love and care is so very important though! really the most important of all, because if you dont care for yourself you wont be capable of doing your best for others like your children and family.",UgjCxo0gAKkeV3gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-03-28T21:28:41Z,0.9540032744407654

547.0,"I know I'm a little late on this yoga camp but I tried the first one Adrienne posted last year (i think it was last year) and stopped the second day because I didn't think I had time, so I did a few of her yoga videos here and there when I wanted to take time for myself (which really wasn't very often). I decided instead of taking time for myself by watching netflix or scrolling on social media worrying about other people's lives I TRULY take time for myself and check in with where I am at body mind and soul. Although I am in the second day...I feel a little lighter.

 I didn't think I would be able to do 50 minutes, i got a bit impatient/bored halway through but that was because I was going through the motions and not checking in as often, in the last 20 minutes I got into my rhythm of breathing again and being present and the time flew by. I will continue to work on my presence during camp because it really does feel good. 

My inner mantra began with ""I create peace"" and then changed to "" I create opportunities for myself"" and finally ""I create space"" I went between the opportunity and space mantra because I have had a very stressful time balancing work, school and things going on at home. 

My first day was a bit difficult I'm not going to lie, I worked a 12 hour shift and I was very stressed, sitting quitely and being still for a couple of minutes caused a bit of anxiety. However I trusted the video and accepted where I was and it was crazy how quickly my shallow breaths became deeper and deeper and how in control I felt. My second day i learned a lot about where I am at physically, this really makes it easy to go through the motions of your day. For example when I focused on my feet during camp (using all four corners), I would also be aware of my feet when I was standing in the kitchen or sitting at my desk. When I focused on my breathing and posture, I really felt a difference in the way I carried myself. All in all so far so good... I can't wait for tomorrow and I know I will do it tomorrow! I have a really busy Monday and Tuesday (12 hour days) however I think I can squeeze in some time before i go to bed!

Challenging is good though! I'm very much looking forward to building up my flexibility, strength, as well as my inner sense of calm and confidence. 

Side note: I am a musician and the principles in these videos have helped me so much with performing!

1060.0,"Hello Adriene, I wanted to give you a heart felt thank you for introducing me to a yoga practice that I really love! I found your videos by chance on You Tube a couple months ago and have been following you ever since. I never thought I would love yoga so much. No offense...but I never wanted to be one of ""those yoga people"" ha ha.... and now... I can't imagine not doing it. I am steadily improving my practice. I find balance and strength are my biggest challenges as well as allowing the time for my practice to improve.  Because I have a body that is considered ""obese"" by BMI standards... some of the poses and twists can be very challenging. But... I am allowing myself to falter and then do better next time. I have a question for you or for anyone who has been practicing for a while. I notice that I often have muscle spasms and cramps in various parts of my body while I am doing yoga. Any idea why this is happening? or what I can do to help stop them? Am I just dehydrated? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you everyone and I am so looking forward to the rest of CAMP!

I thoroughly enjoyed today's yoga practice with you! It was a ""yummy"" session with some enjoyable surprises along the way. I just love how you walk us beginners through and remind us to breathe, find what feels good, integrity etc. The mantra today ""I create my joy and the room for self compassion"". I especially resonated with the moment you talked to us about how our reaction to losing our balance is equally as interesting as maintaining it. I was reacting to myself without compassion until the moment you reminded me. I appreciate that!! I continue to look forward to day 3.

Today I chose to create time for this yoga practice because it was very very late when I finally took the time to do it, and I decided not to abandon my good will this early in the challenge and go to bed without having done the video! It amazed me how easy it was, I thought 50 min was way too long for the young yogini that I am but in fact, connecting with my breath and my body was easier than I thought.
Thank you so so much for all the hard work you're doing in order to give us this awesome gift of free yoga every week and, during this yoga camp, every day.

I know people say to start it a day later, but to do that, I'll have to skip a day and I was pumped to do daily yoga for 30 days again. I'm going to keep doing it later as often as I can and hopefully I won't end up falling behind. I just don't remember this behind an issue last year, they were all up by the time I was!
