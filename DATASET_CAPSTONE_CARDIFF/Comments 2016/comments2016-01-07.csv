13.0,"Wow, this mantra was soo powerful for me today, thank you so much Adrienne!! When you suggested possibly doing a headstand, I was at first trying to see how far I could go, which was further than I have ever had my head to the ground, but it was not quite there yet, I was doubting that I would be able to reach fully, but as soon as you said ""I am capable"" I repeated the mantra and I was able to reach my head fully to touch the ground!! I was so surprised, I almost fell out of the pose, but I managed to stay in it for the full durations of breaths we took in the practice. 

The very first time I attempted to do a headstand, I ended up rolling backwards (I guess my alignment wasn't quite right) and I kind of hurt myself a bit, so I've been a little weary of pushing it ever since, so I've been taking it slow and after 6 months or so of Yoga now I was finally able to reach!! So happy and proud of myself for how far I've come and so very thankful for all that you do Adrienne to help motivate us to reach our goals.",UgyHE-2iNW_3nOrf4a94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-08-23T17:22:49Z,0.9929244518280029

82.0,"‚úîÔ∏è I am capable of stillness. Maybe not during the tree poses lol but the stillness I feel after practice is like, as the Buddhist's metaphor of cloudy water as myriad thoughts: the dirt settling to the bottom of the vessel to create clarity. I go into practice each day feeling like who knows what, but come out being detached from most things that have happened in past. Which is cool because it allows for newness to enter my life. I really encourage everyone to do shavashna after every practice, because it's really helped me to be okay with different feelings and having a conversation with them. Sometimes I feel like it's not about how many good choices I make, but rather how many detrimental choices I encourage myself not to make. I've definitely stopped thinking that a great day is me doing 10 different ""right decisions""; a good day could also be me doing nothing and staying still on a bad day, and laying on my yoga mat instead of searching for something that makes me feel better (but has poor consequences later). Sorry if this post was super weird or preachy lol but out of all the thoughts, this one decided to manifest so I am just here with it now. It is said with love, and I wish us well on this journey.
