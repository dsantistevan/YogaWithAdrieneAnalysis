7.0,"Thank you for your sweet spirit and positive influence in my daughter's life.
She found you after giving birth to her child. She started yoga to get back in shape but soon realized there were many more benefits. It set her on a path of healing and wellness. She received her certifications after attending yoga teacher's training at Indra's Grace yoga studio where she now teaches. It has helped her to heal some traumas she experienced as a young adult. I believe it also put her on a mindful parenting track as well. Watching her transformation inspired me to start my own self-care and healing journey as well. As a mom of 5 kids I was always putting everyone else ahead of my own development, which I was happy to do. However I have come to realize that by prioritizing some time for ourselves, those around us benefit as well. Thank you for causing such a wonderful ripple effect in our lives as well as so many others lives around the world. You are helping to heal our bodies, minds and spirits. Much love and gratitude from North Texas.💜💜💜",Ugy_CEjbOqHoJne9ALR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-09T15:31:27Z,0.9998024106025696

Not only have I seen a change in myself, OTHERS - have noticed the change within me as well! ""You seem more relaxed and chill!"" ""Something is different about you, I can't quiet figure it out"" - my reply:  ""Thank you so much!  I just completed a 30 day ""Yoga with Adriene"" journey. It's changed the way I think about myself and it's pouring out of my pores!!"" <3  Biggest Change:  I've stopped with my nasty negative inner dialogue whenever I saw myself naked in the mirror. I would always focus on the wobbly bits and everything that is not to the ""Social Media"" standard. But ya know, this wobbly body made it through 30 days of Yoga and I turned out better for it! Don't think if you can do this! I KNOW YOU CAN! You WILL! You GOT THIS!!! - I""m just a day ahead of you!  I'll wait for you at day 30 - we can leave Camp together! WE GOT THIS!!!! Namaste! 

5 years ago my best friend died on Jan 1, 2015. She and I had the same tattoo on lower backs, it symbolized ""Girl I Got Your Back"". When I heard Adriene say: ""...when you feel alone..Yoga has your back...I got your back.."" I was hit with a wave of support, as if Tash was here in the room with me! I""m not alone, I am All One!

""And still, after all this time,
The sun never says to the earth, ""You owe Me"".

Look what happens with
A love like that.
It lights the Whole Sky""

Trust the process, change doesn't happen overnight (as much as I already want to absorb everything that I can right now), I can't rush it.

210.0,I am very new to yoga. I am a recovering addict.  I had alot of back problems after a wreck 17 years ago. I got prescribed pain killers for years and eventually got addicted.  So I got tired of being addicted and sick and hurting all the time no matter how many I took the pain was there. So I decided if the pain is there no matter what I'm quitting. So I did and went through a program for addiction.  I'm still in the program but I'm off of the pain meds. I started yoga to help with my pain and cravings. Because I was and still am and probably will be an addict to pain meds for the rest of my life. But with meditation and yoga i am strong and i do accept my flaws and I am going to over come it. Yoga has changed my out look on life.  Adrian was the very first yoga video I watched. And I have only followed her through this journey.  I started in april doing yoga and meditation every day. It's now August of the same year and I am 100% a different person physically and especially mentally!! Thanks so much!! I love this 30 day yoga plan. The first one I have ever done.

I literally cannot get a right angle. I've tried using my fists for things like cat cow etc, but downward dog (my favorite) is near impossible to hold for long. It's also hard for me to do EVERYDAY, although I so want to.
I'm wondering if blocks might help? I mostly just come in and out of the poses more often to ease the pressure, but keep trying. I'm not sure if this is the way to go.

371.0,"I studied yoga for one term in college, also I took Laban Movement at a university for one term. I have taken several Physical Education courses over 20 credits, all of them one credit a course. I trained to be a Combat Medic in the U.S. Army. I also worked in construction for several years in my younger adult years. I took a little martial arts and aerobic weight training in my early 20's. I had a journey learning to work and living skills. I am catholic and worshipped God as often as I could living as an Adult. I studied Laban Movement for a term and another 3 months private course of Modern Dance when I was 30. I have trained to be a triatholon athlete running and swimming, riding a bike. Because I had such a wide variety of physical training and learned discipline from work, Yoga was a little different to mentally experience. I learned in the army strength training in a different manner, you never relax in the army. You are totally challenged to learn a mental strength for using weapons and being very alert, so that you can respond to attack at a fraction of a second. When I got out of the army I had to re-train to learn to live again among civilian. I wasn't in very long even. However war training is nothing like civilian training and mentally changes your bearing in life. I don't stick with yoga stretches after the class I took but I do combine my laban movement with some martial art like forms and a bit of yoga like stretches.  Last night I came up with some project similar to your yoga camp. I started with the Rising Sun, then the sun's course, Then the Moon, and today I started the Waters of Life, and will keep going through them until I have renewed my mind and body a bit. I took a few years off from fitness to do some online courses at a university. What I don't like about Yoga is the origins of some of the religious aspects of yoga meditations , I learned to meditate in a crisis hotline operator class. As a Catholic I don't think old world religions are the best source for spiritual guidance, but the exercises I think take some of the conventional boredoms out of life and do help your health. I am more into strength and endurance exercise myself, like hiking and running. Well just wanted to share , I think out of sheer boredom ,  I don't know.",UgwjWGJpvQ0NctRZ1nF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-10-28T22:45:10Z,-0.7126733064651489

Every time I start I get to a point I am comfortable with or am enjoying and progressing, then I just stop (for various reasons). I'm deciding to do yoga camp because last year I started and never finished. It is a great one for me right now because of the connection to self (mentally and physically). This time I am accept the challenge to come to my mat everyday for my mind and body. I accept the commitment, that will hopefully last longer than 30 days.  I wanted to thank you again Adrienne for your channel, for the accessibility, and for being who you are.

509.0,"I had already done 30daysofyoga with you in 2015, multiple times, and LOVED it. So I started Yoga Camp in Feb 2016, but just before I started, things in my life got extremely out of control and too much to handle, I had just moved country; everything went wrong. I was in an extremely bad place mentally, and after Day 5 I stopped all yoga (and all exercise) for 5 months! Easily the longest I have been without 'movement'. I wasn't eating or sleeping properly, I would barely leave the tiny house. It was horrible. When I returned to my home country in August, I started Yoga (30daysofYWA) with you again. I was so amazed by how hard it was for me, I was so out of practice!! I was so frustrated; it was worse than 'beginner me'. But I trusted you, and the difference you made in my life before, and stuck with it. Completed the 30days on the 1st of Oct. I made the best progress!

Then, I wanted to try do Yoga Camp, but I was so terrified that the memories and flashbacks would be triggered by Yoga Camp considering I was doing it at the time everything happened. It sounds silly, I knew it was silly, but I couldn't help be scared that it would bring up all those feelings again by way of association. After a few days of trepidation and hesitation, I took a deep breath in  and decided to watch the orientation camp video again. I decided to commit to finding what feels good and Yoga Camp, it was a leap of faith. 
Well, I have now completed Day 7 of Yoga Camp!  

I'm sorry my comment is so long, I just knew I had to come back to Day 1 and get this out and encourage anyone else starting this challenge. 
I never comment on anything, until starting Yoga Camp. You asked in the orientation video to connect to the community, I have heard you say it so many times. But now I am :) and I am so grateful to be a part of it!

I noticed that your right leg, left back and right shoulder seemed to be tense in this video. Your left shoulder is down (showing tension in the hip hikers, aka quadrates lumborum), and the right shoulder up slightly. 

This shows also in the right knee not coming down. Mine does this because I've got some knee issues on that side, when I'm tense or perhaps recording a video! I use a meditation pillow to allow my knees to come back down, and it's a bit more difficult to do sitting directly on the ground, as you are.",Ugi41eSq6Aj2yXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-06-02T02:34:14Z,-0.5240944623947144

889.0,"Thank you SO much for your relaxed and gentle style.  I only learned about your channel this week from one of my students.  I just finished day 1.  It was an excellent way for me to start yoga... I've always wanted to, but something has always set me off with the other videos I've seen. My life and work schedule prevent me from participating at a local yoga studio.  

This 30 day yoga camp will be part of my Lenten practice:  being mindful of the time I waste on mindless games on my phone (you know the kind) - break the habit and do something productive or creative instead.  Ok, so I will commit to NO mindless electronic games, no candy, do yoga daily so as to restart exercising and improve my centering, and increase my time knitting and spinning wool (repetitive, smooth actions that become another way to meditate, relax and lower my blood pressure.)

By writing this here, I'm making this a public commitment to which I will be held accountable.

939.0,"Recently I sustained a knee injury (embarrassingly enough I was sitting down and twisted it the wrong way) and I haven't been able to practice yoga as much as I had previously. So I decided do do this video as a way to try and come back to my practice. I found myself getting emotional and frustrated when I realized that because of my injury (basically my knee pops out of the socket repeatedly and it's super painful) I could no longer do child's pose, a pose I used to love to relax in. I started thinking about the affirmation and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to accept that this is where my knee is right now or that this is the way I felt about everything. I realized you probably would have told me to accept both so I tried to do just that and took my practice slow and steady. Hopefully I will be able to get to where I was but even if I can't your bright personality helps to curb the negative thoughts that sometimes creep in when people practice yoga.

There were times in this video I felt like I was in table top or seated position listening to lots of explanations for 2-3 minutes.  I actually had to turn this video off!  I did not feel stretched or challenged.  I'm not saying that everyday has to be balls to the wall but I want to feel like I'm getting something out of every practice.  Not at all how I expected a new challenge to kick off.",UgiXI8CYjbKqkHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-07T18:23:05Z,-0.9830561876296997

I began to hate yoga and hate that the instructor thought that I just wasn't trying my best. It was really a terrible feeling.

Thankfully I have found your videos, and I've been following along now for some time and I feel greater than ever (along with busting my moves in hip hop dance class) and my posture has improved so much.

So thank you so much for allowing us to be us and going at our own speed and paces. I think sometimes we forget to not try to keep up with the Joneses.

Well, it took me to an orientation video.  Then today, I didn't have anything in my mailbox.  I checked out You Tube and found this titled ""Day 1, Accept"".  Kind of weird, but I guess to be on the safe side, I will double check You Tube if I don't get more emails each day.  

Blah blah blah, small minor detail really in the grand scheme of things, right? ; ) The important thing is that I loved this video and am excited to continue the rest of the month.  Thank you for this, Adriene and thank you for being you.  : )

1746.0,Good morning everyone!!! I am 22 weeks pregnant and plan on following this 30 day journey. I fully realize I will need to modify some of the movements. Today was pretty simple as far as modifications. I just took it easy with the Spinx pose (at about 10 minutes) and then needed to make a little extra space for my belly towards the end (25 minute mark) when sitting up and bringing up my legs.
