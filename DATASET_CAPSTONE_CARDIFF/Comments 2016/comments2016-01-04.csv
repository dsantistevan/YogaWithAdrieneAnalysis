44.0,"Honestly, I had a pretty rough day before getting on the mat. I'm not doing too hot in my 3D Art Fundamentals class at the moment (limited experience with the medium, for starters). When the professor spoke to me after class about a project that didn't do so well, I told him I assumed that we could only use paper for our sculptures. That was the rule for the *first* project, but turns out not for the subsequent projects. My professor said that making assumptions was bad, and recommended The Four Agreements to me. This hit me like a train because I've had two people tell me I make assumptions, but I always had a reason not to listen to them. I didn't have any reasons to doubt my professor's judgement or integrity, so I knew he was 100% right. So I cried *a lot* after I left the Zoom meeting, thinking about relationships in my life I had unwittingly ruined or damaged due to this ultimately toxic trait of mine. That honestly hit so much harder than anything he said about my project, which was not great btw. I did stop crying, but I haven't felt 100% most of the day, and it was as if literally every toxic thought I had about relationships (romantic or not; expecting to be hurt) just started getting really loud and making themselves abundantly clear in my head. I felt myself getting heated as these thoughts passed through my skull, and I was having these thoughts during the yoga session. When you mentioned toxic thoughts at one point I was like üò≥. Granted, it was more about giving up on certain physical exercises (which wasn't my problem today), but I remember thinking ""How did she know?"" I started tearing up a little bit near the end of the practice. I also heard a lot of pops doing the hip circles at the end. I cried a bit again while getting ready to take a shower and here I am rambling about what happened. I know this was a long post, and I don't know if this is the beginning of some grand transformation, but we're going to find out.",UgznA98cN2hFf4SM7SB4AaABAg,1.0,2.0,2020-09-22T01:49:43Z,-0.98893141746521

I told myself today that I would awaken to something new, and so instead of giving any of those thoughts any more importance, I will let them go peacefully that I can be more ""present in the present.""

I took yoga with a great instructor for a few months last fall, but I recently moved.

She was also caring, like you, and offered plenty of modifications and emphasized peace or mind.

Adriene, or anyone in the yoga community, I just had a question from a realization I just had while doing your yoga and yes, sorry to disappoint you all, but I did look at the video even though you told me to trust the video. Anyways, I noticed that whenever your doing that downward facing dog, your heels are touch the ground. I have problems doing that since they raise up every time I try it. Another thing is that squatting pose you performed around 28:00 in the video. I seem to be having problems keeping with that that but I seem to be straining. Even on the kneel sitting pose around 25:00 I seem to be having a problem. My thighs and shins seem to strain and its very uncomfortable. I am a guy with a lot of muscle on me and I understand that it gets in the way. Is there something I can do to fix these problems?

418.0,"Adriene, today you made me laugh and feel great about doing this Yoga Camp, and feel like I can really do it! I often get in over my head with things I feel I want to do more often, making promises I end up not being able to keep and feel bad about not keeping, just because I never ease into anything and instead try to go full throttle from day 1, ""I'm going vegan from this day onwards"", ""I'm gonna play the piano for 2 hours every evening every evening"", ""From now on I'm gonna practice doing handstands every morning and every evening and spend 15 minutes on dental hygiene and..."", yeah you know. 

But this Yoga Camp is something entirely different! Unlike other yoga videos where I find myself wanting to quit after 20 minutes, or where I have chosen a yoga practice that's way too advanced for me and I end up feeling shit about not being more flexible or durable, YOUR videos make me feel at ease and feel like just showing up to the mat is enough! And it makes me so relaxed and happy about doing yoga, just doing it at my own pace and accepting that I don't need to rush or do a perfect handstand or do a headstand or reach my toes or be more flexible in a week. You are helping me ease into it! You're an excellent teacher and so friendly in your videos, I am immensely looking forward to the rest of this month and hoping that I will actually show up to the mat every day.",UggeQWWAzNrQDngCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2016-02-04T09:40:02Z,0.9980846643447876

Maybe it was the heat in my apartment (every time I came up to mountain pose I noticed how much warmer it was in a standing position, making me feel lightheaded), maybe it was a smell in the room (a vinegar scent from kombucha cultures I have drying in my living room), or perhaps it was because I'm still getting over a bad cold at the moment or being tired from waking up an hour earlier than I usually do. I took a bit of time in child's pose to work on my hips a little to make up for it, and i'm not discouraged by this.

And I am not giving myself a hard time about having to modify.¬† I never thought I was that type of person (to berate myself for having to adjust a pose)¬†anyway but there's another thing I learned.

the mind tells the body and the
soul is somehow forgotten.

time is not the clock on the wall;

I awaken.

I awaken acceptance of emotions
flowing within.
I awaken gratitude for 
the body,
the mind,

as the mind relaxes ironically
within this awakening,

like a sea gull floating among mighty waves
hearing the saltiness as softness and 
naturally uses her body to balance,

and I awaken to the joy  that is the
blue sky, the white wind, the green fragrance,
the rainbow

Is there something I am missing/another work around/ anything that would help?   

 Now for my comment...thank you!  I have been trying to start my day with a quick wake me up walk.  Today in RVA it was Cold (like 13 degrees) and I am out walking.  This walk for me is not about beaking a sweat or anything... just get my blood flowing and taking a moment for me.  In the walk I realized my head was forward and I was hunched over and so I took a second to really find my head over heart space and I realized my walk changed.  I had my legs and core became more engaged.  I really saw the day and the sky.  I clued into the sensations and opened up to and allowed the cold and how it felt on me.  It was really cool and a really rare thing for me.  I am a rusher.  I always fight time.  I am always mentally 10 paces a head.  And today I was just there and it was super cool.

752.0,"Thanks Adriene! fan of over a year now and you have really helped me get into my own daily yoga practice, which i was never able to do before! always loved your videos for their holistic approach but very happy to have further emphasis on the ""mental body"" - great term you use! but yes the mind as part of the body. a word on ""toxic thoughts"" which you mentioned, they do have an impact, but i'd like to expand on that with something which i have found very helpful from my own meditation practice. (as someone who has a lot of these toxic thoughts, hoping this might help others also suffering) as you cant usually help having a toxic thought, i've found it is the fighting against the toxic thought, judging yourself internally for even thinking them, and the battle you have within resisting these thoughts that exacerbates them and makes them unbearable. much like you said, i find acknowledging these toxic thoughts with acceptance, ""i am human, i am allowed these thoughts, i accept them and wish to move on"" (a previous mantra i made up with your help from day 1) makes them fade away quicker, then they just come and go, rather than get stuck on repeat. i'm even getting to a point where i can almost laugh at the hard time i'm giving myself and how unnecessary that is! so thank you for everything! and I hope someone else can find peace this way xxx",UgiwX-VbYsk6rngCoAEC,3.0,23.0,2016-01-05T14:09:48Z,0.9872466325759888
