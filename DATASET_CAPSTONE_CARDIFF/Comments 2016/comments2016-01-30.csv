14.0,"Been following and doing the practices for a long time. Every month start a new 30 day practice. Very good for the start of the morning and rest of the day.

2 minor comments. 1) would be good to have shorter sessions like 20min. I know some of the newer ones have them.

And 2) the end message is “may all beings be free and happy” which I 100% agree with. But then Adrienne says she can’t give up eggs and fish. Don’t think those eggs and fish are free and/or happy being served as a meal?

Not trolling…as mentioned I follow the yoga practices and will continue to do so.

But the message vs the practice of not following the message seems to be a disconnect.

20.0,I love you Adriene. I love joining these 30 day practices (I've done many if not all of them) but I always feel disheartened and kind of abandoned when you don't guide the 30th day. It feels inconclusive and as someone dealing with a lot of body pain it just doesn't work to try and practice alongside you without verbal prompts. Hope this is received in the openness it's shared. I've been with you for many years of the path so I felt some feedback was ok. x,UgwZ9IS7XLZM5fjvv6h4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-09-27T14:13:55Z,-0.8890294432640076

 This is my second 30 day challenge and I must say that I am in a much better place physically, emotionally, and spiritually then when I started. I have been able to do things with my body that I never thought possible. I have challenged myself and have been determined to follow through with daily yoga. I am so pleased with the results. 

I must say that this flow from day 30 is hands down my favorite flow of any yoga flow I've ever done. It was perfect.I will be coming back to this video again and again in the future I already know. 

Thank you Adriene for following your gut and your intuition and creating such a wonderful platform for yogis of all stages and walks of life to come to and learn yoga. I have, and I will, continue to spread the word about YWA. It's crazy how many people I mention you to that already know about you or have heard of you or tried one or more of your videos.

Today felt so freeing (and definitely emotional as all day 30s seem to be!) because for the first time on day 30, I barely looked at the video. I mostly free-styled and found what felt good. At one point when I was attempting crow hoping to get it today, I glanced over and Adriene was doing it too! That was cool. I kinda held it for a second but realized I'll have to keep working on it.

But I really wanted to say thank you, Adriene, for putting so much thought, effort and energy into these videos, and for making them so widely available. You've had such a positive impact on my flexibility (so close to heels on the ground with downward dog now!), ability to move my body, thoughts, emotions—everything.

This last practice hit home for me in a pretty profound way. My mantra for today was, ""I am happy"". I truly hope that you continue to spread the message about yoga to people (like me) who never thought they would, or could, do it. I hope that I continue to grow the practice that I have cultivated over the last 6 months through your videos. And most of all, I hope that you, too, are happy.

139.0,"My second 30 days, I’m on to revolution!!  My son told me about you and at 68 i was feeling so sluggish, I gave it a try.  I’ve done yoga before in class and online.  Why I’m succeeding this time? 1. I found a place in my house with lots of windows and set up my stuff.  2. It is private, so I don’t feel like I’m being judged.

After practice I went back and watched you do your practice.  When I’m trying to move along with you i don’t get chance to see what a beautiful, slow, controlled dance that is yoga.  Some thing to strive for.  I really like that you aren’t a yoga snob, so down to earth.

Some days are harder than others but I've come to accept that that's okay. I'm more flexible, I'm still rather clumsy but that's okay too. My mantra today was 'I Am Still'. I'm not sure why.

You’re made yoga a part of my life, I never would have thought of myself pretzling into poses that up until 2 months ago seemed unachievable - I think it was mostly because my perception of the practice was “you have to look a certain way, stand still and be all Zen and shit”. I laughed and cried along the way, the toughest mantra to utter was “I love myself”, so thank you for bringing that sort of energy into my days to come. Best moments were when I’d end some pose and switch to something else cause it felt good, only to peek at the video of the day and see you ended up there too!

Like the 30th day, I did not feel ready to do the practice on my own.  I chose the ""I am Bold"" video and was about halfway through it when my internet went out.  I waited for a few minutes, then started my own practice, hearing Adriene's gentle voice in my head, guiding me through my own practice.  After about 20 minutes, the internet came back, and I completed the rest of the video.  A 33 minute practice turned into a 52 minute practice, and I am filled with awe and gratitude for everything I have learned from Adriene.

233.0,I'm sorry but this is not a good idea. You have to strain your neck to watch what to do instead of just being able to flow and listen. I don't wear my glasses to do yoga and I couldn't see the screen properly to tell what you were doing. I realize you were hoping that everyone would just flow in their own way but the whole purpose of watching videos is to get the guidance we need to do yoga safely.

257.0,"I found it hard the first time I did this. This time however I enjoyed myself and was super mindful of my back as I overworked it today, also enjoyed seeing Adriene do her thing. I peaked a couple times and saw chair pose into the side stretch which was fun as you focused to see if the ground would catch you as your leg shot out which it did! Then later on as I was doing a stretch I saw you flying in crow, i literally said 'wooohooo look at her go shes flying' not even joking I said it haha into later with simba cliff crunches wooohoooo they looked mega! Was rooting for you! Thank you so much Adriene for all you do and give us. Xx

 I was enjoying my slow practice I really overworked my back today lifting heavy things etc so was taking it super slow and rocking alot to ease pressure. Though I enjoyed an opening of my wings in a low lunge which felt so nice. I was rubbing my lower back ever so often with my knuckles from the inner spine outwards like a plane, felt soooo good. That's my way of apologising to my lower back haha have so enjoyed this journey 2nd time around too. Onto the next 30 day challenge. Let's go!

282.0,"⏳ And just like that, another 30 Day Challenge comes to an end. 🙏  It's so crazy to look back and see how Day 1 became Day 14...30.. now 60. I've learned a lot, and am excited to learn so much more. 

Yoga has become a friend that checks in daily with me to see how everything is going. Because of this, I'm more conscious of the decisions I make. If the day leaves me drained, I get to examine it; but if I feel energized, I can keep and nurture those things. The email this week with John O'Donahue's poem was really amazing, especially this line:

""The darkened days that stopped
The confidence of the dawn.""

I feel like I've picked up where I left off before life became really hectic (in the darkened days) this year, and with the confidence and energy from you and Yoga, I will be able to challenge the new (and some old) difficulties ahead. 

There's much I would like to do for people who are trying to better their lives, but as you've pointed out: we have to nurture ourselves so that we can nurture others.

I'm really looking forward for the new ""Home"" Yoga journey, and for ""Yoga For Transitions"" practice tonight for NYE.

As soon as the music started I closed my eyes and jumped deep into it. It was me telling me what to do, it was me finding what felt good. At first the mantra was “I’m in control”, but the deeper I dove the fuzzier the mantra became. I opened my eyes, and could not believe what I saw: You and I both solidly in our warrior position... I felt connection, like I never felt before. I found confirmation, “I Am Free” !!!
I said it loud, I felt it strong. And then the music brought me to the safest harbor of practice end. We bowed a sincere and wordless Namaste...
Tear drops...
And it felt soooooo good

310.0,"Thank you for such a beautiful 30 day yoga practice. I have not had a daily yoga practice before, and this last 30 days has brought about so much transformation that I will be continuing on for another 30 days. This last practice was especially amazing... I really appreciate how you left it open for my intuition to guide me. I was scared at first and then just started breathing and moving... and then occasionally I would glance up and see we were doing the same thing! It just filled my heart to have that connection, and to somehow magically end my practice as the video was ending and see the closing heart when I opened my eyes. So much love!

319.0,"I didn't expect today to make me so emotional. I've been practicing with you for three years now. I did True and Dedicate as it came out, and after Dedicate I wanted to work my way through all of the 30 Day Journeys and back, with some days to catch up on your newly posted videos. Right after Revolution, I dislocated my dominant shoulder acting in a movie, pitching an apple, a cute idea that wasn't even in the script and i never had been injured before. This injury robbed me of my yoga, my music playing ability and kept me from working on my new home this summer. I've been in Physical Therapy for several months, and had a sling on for three. I was so scared I reached out to the Kula community for support before my FB friends or Insta followers. Someone in the community told me ' I have the opportunity to learn the REAL healing power of yoga' initially, that pissed me off SO bad, but probably because I knew it was true, and it was. I still practiced finding what felt good with the sling on, but before my arm popped out I was JUST beginning to hit the arm balances, and for the first time in my life feeling strong. Today I FINALLY finished Yoga Camp. I started 30 days ago, and I feel strong again. I realize I can heal to do what I've done before and to go beyond, the community was right. I am learning the healing power of yoga. I leave tomorrow to go on a big trip to finishing acting in the movie i hurt myself on, then act in two feature films and fly in a plane for the first time in my life. I feel strong and supported in myself, and not nearly as afraid as I was 30 days ago. As a fellow actor & artist, I just can't thank you enough for what you've shared with me and everyone else. This practice keeps me calm cool and collected as I try to create relentlessly and hone my intensity. Thank you Adriene. I'll be in Austin working on a film Oct-Nov and will be watching your emails to see if any local classes come up! Every time you're on the East Coast I end up being somewhere else! I hope our paths cross someday but until then I will be sending you positive vibes in your journey and finding what feels good in mine!

I've followed a couple of 30day journeys since april every day and I truely love it. I've never posted something before, but I especialy wanted to thank you. Everytime at the end of the journey I'm getting kind of emotional haha. I can't explain. For what it's worth, I learned a lot of things. I'm getting more flexible by the day, I always discover new possibilities and openings. Sometimes I don't want to go on the mat, but at the end I'm smiling and the last couple of weeks I'm saying the mantra so loud, I guess my neighbours hear them too 😂. I found a way of getting in touch of my body and also and maybe the most important thing, I control my emotions and mind better. I'm looking forward to the next couple of months / years spending my precious time with you on the mat and doing yoga, yey!

366.0,"Dear Adriene


I have just ended my 30 days of yoga camp. This is my first experience of yoga and I am now a full-on yoga fan and you have made it possible. I appreciate the work you put into the camp, as a beginner it was easy to follow and your cues were easy to follow #trust_the_video. I have learnt a lot about myself in this journey, THANK YOU!


My mantra for the last video was ""I allow""... 
..myself to be happy
..myself to be educated
..others into my life


I walk taller, have better balance and posture and feel a happier person. I've told countless people, even strangers about your channel and how I feel after completing a few videos. THANK YOU.


What I do appreciate about you, is that you seem like a genuine person; you'll crack a joke now and then and speak through the mike as if you're right next to me while I practice. I also appreciate that you don't wear skimpy outfits to get viewers (there are soooooo many channels there where they are half-naked but can't explain what they are doing!).


I only realised now that the camp was posted 3 years ago so I don't even know if you'll read this comment but know that I appreciate you and you have impacted my life in a way that is indescribable. I am going to do another 30 day edition and hopefully do it every day as it is such a stress reliever and the self-actualisation is incredible.


THANK YOU.


Namaste

My husband has even caught on and always encourages me to do a video of yours when I am really feeling the weight of my personal struggles! He even asks to join me in my practice with these videos occasionally! It's been so good for me I constantly tell anyone who will (and even those who won't) listen to give these videos a try and it's my go-to advice for anything physical, mental, or emotional! I've always been a big believer that people are just people no matter how famous they are, and that's exactly why I love these videos. I feel like I am doing yoga with a friend or mentor, not a well-known youtuber with a few million followers!

I also didn't trust my intuition to go off on my own--Only because I'm not as familiar on how to get in and out of poses.  But, I tried the crow and wow, had both feet up for just a second... better than the first time I tried it. I feel stronger in my ability to do yoga and to continue on. Now to Yoga Camp 30 or Revolution. I haven't decided yet. Maybe I'll take a few days and dive into the YWA library and find what feels good before going into the next 30 days. My mantra I kept repeating today was ""I release.""

532.0,"Hi Adriene 👋🏻 It's my second time doing yoga camp and I teared up AGAIN. Gosh, you are just too easy to love. You have the most warm and inspiring presence. Something that really hit me hard this second time around was when you said ""you have to take responsibility for your own happiness"". I sometimes perceive my depression, the world, my financial situation, my job, as some inevidable weight that'll always hold me back. But that comment stuck with me becuase regardless of who or what I blame for being unhappy, it doesn't change that I'm unhappy. I have to take initiative and show up for myself. I don't think I would've discovered self love and how to emotionally take care of myself without these yoga sessions.

Some mantras of Yoga camp have helped me make important decisions and show people I care about who make me grow how appreciative I am of them.

When I began in April I was in rough shape as my thyroid was acting up big time, and I had at least 25 bizarre symptoms that were so bad that I had to take time off working. Due to adrenal fatigue and gut concerns I knew I couldn't workout anymore either. I was looking for some gentle, more restorative type of yoga and going to classes weren't even an option anymore. Here I am, 3 - 30 day challenges later and a whole lot of clean food eating detoxing and feeling like a new woman. Having access to these classes for free made a massive impact on my recovery. I have also been able to share these classes with family, friends and clients.

659.0,"Day 30 Check.

So, I guess I'll have to conclude it right here. I'm going to have to be brutally honest and say it: I'm kind of disappointed. I was hoping that by doing this that I would change, that I would be more flexible or feel a bit more better, or something. I still stumble on some of my poses, I still have to lift my heels at downward dogs, I can't keep my balance when my balance was required, I don't know. Maybe Yoga is not for me. And it's really disappointing and painful to say that. I feel really terrible saying this, I really do. And I've been waiting for a reply to the questions that I've been asking and no one has replied to them, which made me feel kind of left out and disconnected when this is supposed to be a community about connection. 

I seriously don't know. Maybe I missed something? I did all 30 days and if I missed one day, I would do two sessions the next day. Maybe I have to do more Yoga? I... I don't know. I'm just loss.

All this aside though, I appreciate the passion, work, effort, and time put into these videos by your Adriene. I just only wish that I didn't feel so hollow at the end of it all. I don't know whether I should continue or find something else... I don't know..

I just want to say that I welcome everyone's retort on this matter. Not only that, I implore someone to make a retort on this. I'm not trying to be negative, in fact, I started this because I wanted to stop being negative and change myself. Again, it's just so painful to admit no change to this. I wanted guarantee that there would be something different about it. Sigh. I don't know. Maybe I'm thinking way into this or maybe I'm still negative and really haven't change. That would make me sad. 

Anyways, regardless of this, I'd like to thank Adirene for really doing her best at making these videos. I only wish that my forms were just as beautiful as yours. Maybe I need some time off and think about it. I only wish that I didn't feel this way at the end of it all. Thank you Adirene, you are the best.

I have never felt a passion like this in my 20 years on this earth and will now continue to spread this love and knowledge and power to everyone I meet and that will listen.

I will be continuing my journey on my own but will also be doing my home yoga with you every single day and love every minute of it.

790.0,"Today was a tiring day for me. Lolling about on my bed, in between falling asleep and waking up and a terrible headache, and it took me 1 whole hour to convince myself to get onto the mat. When I found out that today's practice was freestyle, I really wasn't too thrilled about it as I've always just been following practices pose for pose, so I just decided to follow along to what Adriene was doing as it was what I have always been doing. It was pretty hard having to constantly look up at the screen as I tend to follow her audio cues, so 5 minutes in I kinda got frustrated, and even considered just switching to another yoga video to do. However as this was the last day of yoga camp, I decided to just go ahead and move with the flow -- occasionally doing what I felt like, and occasionally doing what I saw on the screen... A little tough at first but then it started getting more and more comfortable. And now I feel great! Thank you Adriene for always being the wonderful teacher she is and for encouraging and urging many of us on and on everyday, allowing us to find courage and comfort from within and helping us embrace who we are.

Thank you so much, Adriene.  Your spirit and generosity are contagious, and I'm grateful that you found me.

The transformation I've experienced has been mind-blowing. At first I was looking for flexibility and lengthening, then I found strength, and through heat and sweat I found a leaner more confident Me under a puffy layer of guilt and glut.

You were my teacher from day one, and through it all i've learned countless positions, gained strength and learned determination, and most importantly, I've learned to accept myself. As the last theme came on, I teared up a bit, because I've grow up through Yoga Camp. Adriene, thank you for doing what you do. I accept. I create. I embrace. I awaken. I am alive. I am supported. I am capable. I choose. I am bold. I am present. I release. I trust. I deserve. I go with the flow. I am open. I enjoy. I am focused. I surrender. I respect. I am worthy. I believe. I surround myself with... I am secure. I am in control. I am strong. I attract. I am grateful. I celebrate. I love. Finally, I have found what feels good.

829.0,"Hi Adriene, Day 30 of Yoga camp complete and the silent practice was inspiring and emotional. I have spent a little time with yoga a few years ago on and off but after a heavy year and some back issues I took to you tube and found an honest and open soul. In the last month everyone in my life has commented on my more relaxed persona, I am eating clean and exercising everyday and have climbed and hiked every weekend around the various amazing options we have in Queensland, Australia. I am also more effective at the office (my busienss) and have removed a few toxic issues out of the way with ease. I am heading to Japan in 5 days and intended to climb Mt Fuji with my partner as part of the trip but with a twitchy back I was not sure. I am now confident that I can climb it with ease and I will give you and your practice a little thought at the top. I am 46 and back to my mental and physical groove thanks to your practice so thank you and know what you do actually kick starts lives!",Ugim7bRlz9qRGXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-07-02T23:53:58Z,0.9996925592422485

861.0,"I cried at the end of this video and I feel so much gratitude and love towards Adriene for Yoga Camp and 30 days of Yoga. Over the past year i've struggled hugely with anxiety and generally being unhappy and a bit of a recluse. But 30 days of Yoga showed me I can commit to something for a full 30 days, and Yoga Camp showed me how to speak positively to myself, and how to love myself. Because it's all well and good telling someone they should love themselves, but providing them with the tools to do so often gets missed out. So thank you Adriene for helping me grow and cultivate a practice and lifestyle which serves me. I think without yoga and Adriene I would still think toxic thoughts about myself, and I would not have had the courage to make a big decision I made directly after Day 23, because that video and affirmation gave me the strength to do so.

946.0,"Finished! But really just beginning to feel much of the change I've wanted for such a long time. Today's free form was tough to ""not follow."" But I'm going to loosen up and try it again tomorrow. 

I am So. Much. Stronger. While my crow pose is still just a single deep-breath glimpse of strength and balance, I'm proud to say I haven't collapsed on my wrists and face in weeks. Every day, I try it again: navel to spine, gaze forward, lengthening the shoulders away from the ears. I hear this guidance and follow it beyond practice, throughout my day: walking the halls of the school where I teach; schlepping my kids in the minivan from piano to soccer to baseball; folding laundry; washing dishes; planning the week with my husband; sitting over cocktails with friends. My practice is more than just the minutes of the video, it's all the minutes of my day -- treasures, every one of them. You have reminded me of that. A zillion blessings upon you, Adriene.

1011.0,"Hello Adriene,

my name is Tine and I'm 23 years old. I live in Germany and study primary school teaching.

I just wanted to tell you how much your videos mean to me. I started last year with the first 30 Days of Yoga Challenge and loved it from the beginning! It's so good that you always give options and also that you include this positive body image, which for me is equally to or even more than the poses what yoga is all about.
The funny thing is, last year I was a little lost with day 30. Like some other people commented, it's a bit scary that there is no voice to guide you. This year was different. I looked forward to it! I noticed that I sometimes forgot about the breathing, but hey, I still have so much to learn..

Since I'm going to be a teacher one day, I thought about getting an education in teaching yoga to kids. Because for me, before I practiced yoga, I had this really undefined image of my body. Nowadays I know that there are things which I'm not completely satisfied with, but I know what I have and with yoga I learn to love myself everyday a bit more (so cheesy :D).

So what my point is: I think it could be really good for children to get to know their bodies and what they're capable of and especially with puberty coming up. There's so much confusion about themselves and their bodies are changing and I think Yoga could help to keep them stable somehow. Maybe. Hopefully!
(If there's someone out there who already does that, please share your experiences!)

Sorry for the long read, but I really wanted you to know how I grateful I am and how much you influenced my life in a positive way.

Liebe Grüße,
Tine",UggPNOmfrcSYBXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-03-20T15:23:00Z,0.9978399276733398

Thank you so much for this whole challenge. It's been an amazing journey, with tons of ups & downs, tons of discovery. Finding what feels good really is a journey. We now all have to cherish it & let it grow. Have changed so much since last year's 30 Days of Yoga. Taking this kind of trip once a year helps you reset, recalibrate what needs to be adjusted in order to keep moving forward at your own pace (took me 2 months to complete the challenge). Thank you for making this possible in our own living rooms, no matter where we live. What you have created is a truly beautiful community.
Namaste :)

I actually just got back from backpacking in India (I have a whole vlog series about it) and the journey and especially this past 30 days has been hugely transformational for me - the yoga is a huge part of it, the deep diving personal work I've been doing and even the herbal detox program I've been on. All of it is interrelated and no coincidence it's happening at the same time. So thank you Adriene, thank you for being a part of my journey to reground my body and mind before I go back to Boston to start a new life.

Adriene, thank you.  Thank  you for being the wonderful, inspiring, positive human that you are.

I'm teaching many of my students on the Autism Spectrum some of the techniques I'm learning here, while implementing my Music Therapy sessions.

I was a little frustrated by the video at first. I stopped it about 4 times - I couldn't keep up without the oral prompts. And then I remembered my mantra, ""I am spirit"". And I allowed myself the frustration, and eventually moved into my groove. 

In Savasana, at the very end, I cried, and laughed, and cried and laughed (maybe it was the sweet music? Maybe it was for a reason I never need to ""know""). And thanked you, and me, and the universe.

I want to express my gratitude, the practice was amazing, started a bit later and skipped some days. But 2 weeks later and I've completed all 30 days of yoga camp!

During Yoga Camp me and my girlfriend watched a Dutch television show about Maggie Doyne and her quest to help suffering and unwanted children in Kopila Valley, Nepal. After the 30 days of yoga camp I wanted to thank you and support this goal. Why not combine it!

To express my gratitude, me and my girlfriend made a small donation in your name to blinknow.org. I really want to thank you for the effort and the spirit you put into these videos, they are truly amazing. Your guidance and humor really helped me through the 30 days.

1192.0,"Dear dear dear Adriene, I am soooooo very grateful for you coming into my world, you are a divine yogi and I am so very blessed to have learned so much from you these last 30 days. My mantra today was 'I am proud'...of the journey I have taken, to be able to connect my mind and body and to be here on my mat today on day 30 (holly cow never thought I could do it!!!!!)! I loved today's mantra, because you taught me the most important lesson! I hadn't expected to guide todays practice by myself and at some point I wasn't feeling it (no inspiration for what to do next) so I thought I'd follow you but that was hard for me without your voice while trying to breathe and feel my body ALL AT THE SAME TIME whaaaaaa... and so, little ol'  me felt frustrated and abandoned there for a moment:), until I realized: 

it's okay to get lost, to get frustrated, to not love the pose - and still feel worthy about my practice! So that's my biggest achievement after 30 days: just allow myself to be me, and feel everything I feel without passing judgment and admitting to myself I am here to learn and to experience, including the things that don't go perfectly. And I am not aiming to be perfect, thank god. And then I cried (yes me too), all happy tears... So today was a wonderful ending to my beautiful journey with you. A million thanks!!!!!!!!!!!

I can't believe the last day of yoga camp has come and gone, I am really going to miss your sweet, pure, quirky:), honest self guiding me daily and above all teaching me to trust and love and cherish myself and my body.

1199.0,"Dear Adriene,
I finished the yoga comp on Tuesday. I wanted the time to thank you for the experience but at the time I found it difficult to find the words. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. It took me 39 days to complete the camp but I accept that. In 39 days I have done more yoga than in the 23 years prior to it! I have come to enjoy my home practice and I truly found what feels good, especially on day 30. At first I followed your lead I realized that a was strong enough to trust myself to follow my own lead and I went with the flow. I enjoyed and celebrated that last day and I find myself falling in love with yoga. 
Perhaps in the future I will find a yoga studio in my area so someone trained can help me become better but for now I enjoy the at home practice immensely. I deserve to take that time for myself. Thank you for all the lessons I have learned during camp and for all the lessons you will teach me in the future.

(Coming back after missing a day here or there was HUGE for my perfectionistic self.) ""I'll go back to 'I celebrate.'"" But a few minutes into the practice, I realized that going off on my own meant that after these 30 days I have everything I need to continue. I'm not just dabbling or starting anymore.

What can be said that hasn't yet been said?  Fate brought me to your channel and I am forever thankful.  I feel great about myself.  My big boohoo was on Day 29, saying ""I love myself"" out loud and proud!

I genuinely didn't think I would be able to fill 39 minutes with my own made up practice but I actually found myself only occasionally glancing at the video - I surprised myself!  I really struggled with choosing my own mantra but perhaps it should be something like ""I'm not as rubbish at this as I thought, actually, so go with the flow"" or something.  Sorry, I struggled with the mantras in general, especially the very strong ones, I find blowing my own trumpet EXTREMELY difficult, so ""I'm not as rubbish as I think I am"" is honestly very positive and strong for me.

After this yoga journey, I know good things are coming. I feel motivated to keep coming to the mat, to keep trying new things and make new habits. I feel excited for the first time in a long time. I started a few days late, and had to take an extra day when I needed it, so I feel like I was a bit behind. But every day (every SINGLE day) of yoga camp felt perfect, like it was just what I needed. Every hard day I rocked it out. Day 13 was exhausted and super early in the morning (only way I could sneak it in), I was so grateful when you said, ""Lucky day 13, you guys get an easy practice!"" So perfect. Thank you for all the thought you put into this series (and your heart and soul!)! Truly grateful. Will be starting the 30 days of yoga next.

Adriene - your 30 Days Yoga camp have given me my Health a whole new level. 26 years ago a simple surgery Went terribly wrong which resulted in damaged lungs. I have since then slowly worked myself back to a fairly ""normal"" Life even though my lungs are at only 50% capacity at maximum today. Early in the process of regaining my Health I studied a lot about mental training and holistic principles. Today Im a licensed Mental trainer and Amarican Polarity therapist. For all those years I have had to inhale a special medication to keep up my breathing but in the last weeks it felt like I turned around a corner in Life. With your Yoga practice together with a new focus on what foos to eat, now LCHF style, its no longer needed for me to take that medication!!! Me and my Wife are going to do your camp again to really repeat and create strong new lifechanging habbits. By the way - your mantras are AWSOME, just my cup of tea as a MT.   (I also produce a Health newsletter in Sweden and there I naturally have celebrated you and your great spirit  http://madmimi.com/s/aab537 )  With great thanks to you / Mikael Widerdal  at ALLINMIND.COM",UghcJ30QvMOWdHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-02-01T21:13:33Z,-0.8537931442260742

1424.0,"First... thank you. A million thank you's for sharing your time and talent with all of us. You have been the best camp counselor ever.

Second, I definitely had a moment at the end when you went hands to heart then hands to third eye. I did it with you and it was an oddly emotional moment, like the end of a amazing book.

My mantra was ""I am essential."" I picked it for a couple reasons. The first reason is because I work at a hospital; during terrible winter weather when the entire midwest is closed down for a day or two, I report to work as ""essential personnel."" My other reason also comes from working at a hospital. Sometimes I see emotionally awful things. Sometimes I have to put on a poker face in the midst of little hope. I have to block some things out and just keep rolling during a busy day... then sometimes I get home and it hits me what I saw. Today I had a few of those ""sometimes."" But what I do is essential. Because I am essential.

Thank you for the opportunity to remind myself of that today.",Ugg54TUFnSlSzHgCoAEC,2.0,17.0,2016-02-01T04:11:19Z,0.9993451237678528

Even though I have not missed a day, before today I've not been brave enough to do my own, and have always followed your guidance. Today (after a bit of mental resistance) I DID IT, and feel I've unlocked a whole new level of myself and my yoga practice.

You are such a wonderful human being for sharing this in such a beautiful and accessible way, without judgement, and with such obvious love.

Yoga Camp helped me to find what feels good, to find out that there can be moments where I respect and love myself... every single day of the month I enjoyed to take time for my body, my mind and my soul! 
So first I have to thank Adriene for showing me a way to something new, to Yoga, to that feeling inside of me which I can`t explain at the moment, maybe one day ;-) It feels like there has started and changed something in a good way... 
And second I want to thank all my fellow campers! It felt like I could feel all your energy which helped me to hop on the mat every day. I appreciate that I can be a part of these wonderful community!
At the end of the movie ""Mary Poppins"" there is the moment when the wind changes. It`s just a little thing which happens every day but sometimes it can be something special, something big for someone, for me! I choose to be present and enjoy every beautiful, little wind blow in my live!

Lessons learned:
It is not about how good, bad, perfect your practice is. Change comes from your heart, just breathe! If you love it, it will change you and you will get things done.

And by god was it lovely. I didn't want it to end! I might return to this in the morning, simply because I really enjoyed it :)

Also, halfway through, while I was in a warrior II, I decided to add ""I have the force"" to the mantra. I am a star wars fan and my goal in this was to become a Jedi.

1582.0,"Thank you so much Adriene, this experience has meant so much to me and has been something amazing to look forward to each day. I know that my mental landscape has changed for the better and that I have started on something that can only grow more and more beautiful, which works perfectly with my mantra today which was 'I grow'.
I love knowing that my body is changing slowly but surely. I love the shake as much as, if not even more than, the stillness because it shows me how alive I am. I had a mini-stroke a few years ago when I was 24 and that took some sensation and strength away from me, but doing yoga and focusing on caring for and loving my body has made me feel so much more aware of how much my body can still do and how truly awesome that is.
Thank you! Congratulations everyone, I am so proud to have been a part of this!",Ugg253DpLn2longCoAEC,0.0,10.0,2016-01-31T15:09:25Z,0.9998477697372437

Or maybe I would've gotten angry at myself and ragequit again and felt even worse--who knows? I'm also wondering why people so often choose to do what they know is bad for them over and over again.
