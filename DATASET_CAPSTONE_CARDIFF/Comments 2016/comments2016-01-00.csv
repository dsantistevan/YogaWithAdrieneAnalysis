6.0,"Just completed day 11 and am enjoying this ride with you Adriene & community. You know I'm wondering what the theme song is of Yoga Camp? It gets right into my core and heart every time I hear it at the beginning and end of the practice. There is something about the harmonies that my heart resonates with strongly. It's also a reminder on how powerful music is in order for our movement/yoga practice to find a direct link and pathway to our feelings as it includes our emotional body while particularly stimulating our body fluids through sound frequencies. So what's the song? Would love to know, many thanks to you all",Ugxx0AbG4lDsMtJdkLp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-09-11T09:32:29Z,0.9997875094413757

I was pretty much convinced that yoga just wasn't for me, but after suffering too many injuries long distance running, and recently being diagnosed with insertional gluteus medius tendinosis that cannot be healed, only managed, I decided to give yoga a try one last time. Enter Adriene! I had tried a few of your videos in the past, and either I wasn't in a good head space, or I needed something more structured to get started, but this time I chose your 30 Day Challenge, and now I'm hooked, and ready for Yoga Camp!

That taking a break is not the same thing as giving up. Accepting where we're at has been a huge and challenging lesson for this Type A.

Anyway I am so sad about this because I LOVE going to class. There is something about the energy you get from having a bunch of yogis coming together challenging and encouraging one another. So I was searching the internet trying to come up with a way for me to stay energized with a practice at home and, wa-la, your youtube channel popped up. I knew this had to be promising since we share the same first name (minus an ""n"") :-). So I am going to accept this 30 day challenge and try to remain active in my asana practice without my studio.

158.0,"I've just completed the 30 day yoga challenge - it took two months but i got there. I really want to start the yoga camp challenge tomorrow but there are two things I'm struggling with and wonder how others deal with these - managing to fit in yoga around meals (you're supposed to practice on an empty stomach right?) and I cant fit in these longer vids in the morning before breakfast. By the time Ive got my son to bed its 8pm before I eat and usually cant wait longer than that. So does this mean I need to wait until 11pm before i can practice yoga?! Cos that is too late for me! 
The second thing is I have just come on my period. Ive always been led to believe that you shouldn't do yoga when menstruating. Is that right? Or do others do any kind of yoga regardless? 
I'd love to continue stretching my daily practice with this challenge but need to find a way that works to get around the meal time thing. I'm a single working parent btw..",UghSE0LYv9OWxngCoAEC,1.0,0.0,2016-12-13T21:19:32Z,-0.9949794411659241

This set to me feel so much gentler and I am learning new poses in yoga, such as on day 13, the lotus pose. I love your free spirit, non-judgmental way of doing yoga. If possible I would love to see some mudras as well with the practice. Even without that, I feel so much better and more alive. You truly are the one that gets me up and gearing to go. I lost my baby girl and there was a time when I was so severely depressed I could not do anything, just wasn't ready to live life. You are the one that truly inspired me to get back on the mat again and face life again and just breathe. EVery single one of these are absolutely perfect.

I've done this for a few years now, and today after handling the drill for a while, I noticed him kind of wince in pain, put the drill down, and he had to stretch his hands before going back to work.  My grandpa has always been so youthful and young spirited that this shocked me and I noticed he tried to not let his pain show.  So anyway the point of this being, maybe on an upcoming video you could add some sort of yoga for the hands and fingers (not solely wrists like you have done in previous videos).

I'm even more happy to hear that you will be adding mantras to this years yoga camp. I did your video practice last year and after every video I would go to an other YouTube channel for mantras and meditation. If I can do it all in one it will be amazing.

363.0,"I love you!  But I do take issue with the fact that you say we are going to come into our dream bodies. As someone who works with people with eating disorders and those who struggle deeply with body image, I hope you can encourage people, especially the ladies, to be at peace with what they've got. ""Dream bodies"" are often unattainable and acknowledging that such a thing exists (and supporting achievement of that goal, which you do by saying ""...this time of year where we really want to slim down, tone up, come into our dream bodies. And we can do that we will do that and it is possible"". I appreciate what you say afterwards but it doesn't erase the message (that darn second sentence) that you are sending that says we achieve our dream bodies. Having followed you for some time I know that is likely not the intended message but I had to point it out, as I think a message from you is a powerful one and it is my (literal) job to challenge messages that can be interpreted as harmful from a body image perspective. Again, love you! Just had to address that one.",UgiOqCp5I7r0kXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-04T14:53:19Z,0.9813957810401917

It's been a long road, but the original 30 days of yoga series was there to help me deal with the physical ailments that I could no longer bear in addition to the mental anguish. A year later it is wonderful to see another 30 days of Yoga that has an emphasis on both mental and physical wellness. I'm still a train wreck and I will always struggle with accepting the world as it is, but I accept that the path of recovery doesn't suddenly end and become another path. It is a lifelong adventure and rather than see that as a huge burden I accept that adventure for what it is, challenging and rewarding.

631.0,"Omg this is amazing! You are amazing! I always talk about how important mental health is, but the society doesn't tell us so. If someone says health we only think about the physical health whereas health should be 50% physical and 50% psychological. Maybe mental wellbeing should be even more important than physical. I believe everybody should have a psychiatrist and regular check ups just to talk about things, like we have regular check ups at our doctor. And if you are sick, you will always go to the doctor, but if you've been in a depressed state for a while you never go seek help. So I think this is amazing and everybody should be doing something for their mental health.

Before discovering your channel, I was struggling through a lot of anxiety and stress with my first semester away at a University. I consumed caffeine as if it were on an IV, I hardly slept and if I did then I overslept, I gained lots of weight physically and mentally. But a week ago, I decided to make a change and found you. This yoga camp is exactly what I'm looking for to help me work on not only my physical wellness but my mental as well. I'm really looking forward to practicing positive attitudes, self talk, and yoga along with you and so many others. I really hope that this wonderful start allows me to know how to have a great new year. Thank you so much for all that you do for others :) I just can't wait!!

711.0,"Adriene,  I hear the worry in your voice! No doubts my dear, We are with you! Your post brought me to tears. I made a commitment to this yoga and so, for the first time since I was a teen (I am 32) I stayed in instead of going out drinking and decided to set my goals for the year and your practice is one of them.When I woke up I felt horrible, ear ache, throat ache, tummy ache and I still preceded on. I did my morning meditation and then headed over with the intent to push forward in Yoga camp and the universe rewarded me with a day to catch my breath!  Mental health is a beautiful thing to include in yoga and mind body spirit must be one. I know there are people out there who may have been told this crosses religious boundaries but I  have brought my parents to yoga and meditation even though my dad is a Christian minister and was always taught that all yoga and meditation are eastern religious based and that it can't be good for him, (something about the devil getting into a cleared mind? lol) well, he does both now.That may sound crazy to some but its a common thought amongst many people I grew up with. I am so glad that they can experience the self love I do, without feeling like it takes away- but instead adds to their personal beliefs. <3333 Happy New Year!",UggpNodBl6SwQXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-01T15:11:37Z,0.9974139928817749

721.0,"Adrienne, this whole last year I've been doing intensive therapy to treat mental illnesses, including pretty severe PTSD and some traits of Borderline Personality Disorder which share the symptoms of disassociation (leaving the body). While it's all helped, I've noticed that I needed a physical departure from the trauma I've experienced because as the more behavioral symptoms have lessened, to a slower extent so have the physiological symptoms. Right around when I started thinking that, I found you and did the original thirty days then found myself transformed. I can tell you're a little hesitant because you're afraid (or you were nervous when you started recording this series) that some YWA people will walk away not understanding the value of what you have to offer with this program. I, however, am so grateful that you're doing this it is EXACTLY what I need right now in my wellness journey and I know I'm not the only one. I accept that today was orientation (I knew you were gonna do that!) so may I offer you you in return a guide for your acceptance. A lot of people will probably stroll,  let them walk. They don't need it right now and may not ever need it -AND- a lot of people will probably find you and then find themselves. What alienates some also unites some and also keeps some where they are. This is the dialectical nature of life we experience in every asana's push-pull-rest. I love you, I trust you, I'm ready. But first, I'mma go do that gentle sequence.",Ugg6JpolD0uzx3gCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2016-01-01T14:48:50Z,0.9706957340240479
