49.0,"I surround myself with generous people, because it allows me to give without expectation. When I give my time, energy or anything to generous people, I am seldom worried about being drained or ""paid back"" because I know the more I can do for them, the more they will do for people in their lives; which will hopefully create a cascading effect of positive vibes into the world by ""paying it forward."" And the world is round, and things often have a way of finding themselves back to us. Gotta watch out for the narcissists though, the energy hoarders who will do something for people someday when they have enough, the irony being that you always have enough but just in different ways.

I know every yoga instructor has their own vibe but I haven't felt a more real vibe from any other classes or videos I have done. I am so happy I stumbled upon your channel! Do you have any recommendations for a daily routine with your videos I can follow once I finish Yoga Camp? I am loving that I feel more toned, I'd like to continue working on that!

234.0,"I'm sooo loving your videos, mantras, and random bits of humor!  What I appreciate most is how you give your students ownership in your practice. You empower me.  Instead of saying, ""Do this. Do that,"" you give me a meaningful mantra, and let me finish it myself.  You say, ""Yogi's choice here"" and list options, teaching me to listen to my body and do what works. You give me enough instruction to lead me, but you let me go the rest of the way myself, in a way that is both affirming and deeply satisfying.  To sum it up:  you respect - and expect - my need to do what works for me.    I'm approaching 50 years, yet I feel like a new person.  I surround myself with youth!

I had so much negative energy today and felt so down. Travelling all the way to the town for a public yoga class but was trapped in the traffic; in the end, I missed the class. 3 hours on the road, but in the end without taking the class, my body felt so tight and tired. On my way back home, I was frustrated but I knew I could have some personal practice time with your video's instruction. The first thing I did when I came back home, was to treat myself with some delicious cake and milk; and waited for your new video to be uploaded. After this practice, i feel so alive and want to surround myself with positive energy. It is a daily choice to be happy. Admit the negative energy we experience now and then. Only after that can we accept it and change it.
