62.0,"My core has always been my weakest point. As a kid, doing situps was an insurmountable task, and monkey bars were a no-go. I have some unpleasant memories of kids laughing or giggling when it came to sit-ups, and that was a large reason why I hated gym class throughout elementary and middle school. I had no idea what was wrong with me, and nobody told me what was wrong with me, so it was years before I finally had that clarity. That was more or less the case until high school, when I started to work out at a boxing gym with my mom. That was when I learned to truly enjoy exercise, even when our trainer and good family friend would bust our ass every single time. So my core strength *has* gotten better over the years, but it's not quite where I want it to be yet. With that said, today's practice was definitely challenging, and a couple of moves I couldn't finish all the way through. But I completed the video nonetheless.

I began today‚Äòs practice with freestyle practice on my own which is really exciting as I always felt intimidated and overwhelmed by feeling forced to find my own way. This was because I didn‚Äòt feel myself, I couldn‚Äòt tell what my body and my mind actually needed. So feeling drawn to yummy forward bends and hip opening seating positions really feels exciting and beautiful to me. I started yoga in the beginning of March, nearly 18 months after developing severe feet problems which first would keep me away from my passion of running and lead to chronic pain, stiffness and a worsening posture. By the time unraveling from a toxic relationship I began the journey of acknowledging sexual trauma, mental pressure and dissociative numbness. Finding so much ease in practice now, regaining not only my breath but my voice, feels so promising. I am really grateful to all of this. Thank you.

Considering how many women deal with this very common situation, I'd love to see some variations for abs that don't include crunches, which are one of the worst exercises for a separation and can actually increase the distance of separation.  As it is, I opted to do my physio exercises during this day of yoga camp, but it wasn't ideal.
