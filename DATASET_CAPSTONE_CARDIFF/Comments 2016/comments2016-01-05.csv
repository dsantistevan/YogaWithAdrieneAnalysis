I have been quite stressed these past days because I feel as though I don't have enough time on my hands, I'm trying to juggle a math course, my job, yoga, my horse, my boyfriend and time is not something I have in excess so this weekend I didn't do any yoga and I contemplated not doing it today either. But I did! And I'm really glad I did :)",Ugz1378jh5szz8ei-qh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-28T13:35:47Z,0.9885498881340027

I have arthritis in my neck and Adriene's classes have been great at helping to ease the tension there. I've taken yoga classes elsewhere, but I was always rushing to meet the instructor's flow. Being able to work with these videos has given me the opportunity to slow my practice and give my body the time it needs to actually feel the positions. I am  a fan and will be doing yoga with Adriene every morning! With tons of videos to choose from, I can get the practice my mind and body needs.

It's great to have a yoga schedule to be held accountable for daily for a creature of habit like myself. I have a couple questions though--you're always saying to ""find what feels good"", but I'm having trouble finding the balance between pushing myself to build strength and being in pain which frustrates me! How do you know how much to push in these positions? I want to know my limits but also push past them in a productive way. Second question ties in with this:was this one supposed to be so rough on the knees? I can never do these lunges because I feel like all the weight is jamming into my bony knees. Am I positioning my legs wrong? Is it the hard ground under my mat? Just been working on that pose for a while and can't quite get it! You might not see this but thought I'd try!

363.0,"Adriene, 
I suffer from back pain due to my scoliosis. I have been practicing yoga for 4 years, but gave up often and became frustrated because I was not strong enough to maintain the poses. I guess I didn't know what yoga was at that time. 

My boyfriend has a similar issue, and just does not have the attention span to practice yoga.

Together, we have made it through 30 days of yoga and now working on your yoga camp. You help me to realize that yoga is about breathing and healing and taking it at my own pace. its about growing and easing into it. You helped my boyfriend to realize that there is freedom in yoga and now he practices everyday with me. Both of our pains have eased away, and my back is straightening up. Thank you for sharing your knowledge. It has made a world of difference in our healing journey :) 

Blessings

440.0,"Hi Adrienne, I'm loving this series. I am new to yoga and find that you are doing a really great job with slowly teaching the postures, transitions, and building strength. In this video, I found that the back was strained during both the leg stretch and forward bend. I am not sure if I should be keeping the back straight or curved. In Pilates, I needed to use a strap to keep the back straight. So I feel that both these positions require more instructions and variations. Would it be possible for you to do instructional videos for both in the Foundations of Yoga section? I feel people are going to hurt themselves and develop bad habits trying to do these postures.

I also get a feeling that these 5 videos are pretty much the same, but that might just be the aim here. So I'm really sorry that I won't be able to complete this course, even though I find Adriene an awesome teacher. I also think that even though the classes seem to be at a beginner level, they sometimes deal with quite intermediate moves, holds and even yoga terminology.
