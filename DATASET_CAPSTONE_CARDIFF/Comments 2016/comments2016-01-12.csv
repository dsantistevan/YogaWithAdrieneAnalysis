67.0,"✔️ I have a quote I wanted to share: ""A bird sitting on a tree is never afraid if the branch breaking because her trust is not on the branch, but on her own wings."" When it comes to trust, this quote really resonates with me because it's so easy to forget the power of mobility we have as humans. So many of us show up to practice to strengthen our physical and emotional wings, and it's such a wonderful thing when we realize the more energy we have in our physical bodies, and the more emotional courage we have to say ""no"" to things, the stronger our wings become. And then we can go on the journey of happiness, sadness, ups and downs and enjoy it. I'd like to end this thought with another Zen proverb: ""Let go or be dragged."" If we don't strengthen our wings, we will feel anxiety by being in a constant reactive state to things happening to us. This is something I am still working on myself; the practice of letting go myself so that I don't allow myself to get dragged (as often) by things I need to detach from. The branch may fall, but our wings are strong and we will let go of the things that no longer serve us! 🙏 Namaste",UgymiOEDd_4XiPqCLhB4AaABAg,15.0,168.0,2019-12-11T00:14:10Z,0.9989222288131714

77.0,"Man, I keep forgetting to comment on the videos.  On a few you mentioned you were in an car accident.  I was in something similar.  I fell out the truck, and had to have surgery to stitch my leg up.  That recovered great, it was just my back/hips that didn't.  I went outside to help my grandma, and that was the last straw that broke the camel's back.  Continued to have back pain, and I have been going to the chiropractor for weeks, and months.  My friend recommended I do Yoga, and I have been doing this since February; first started with your Dedicate series earlier this year.  I have noticed I've gotten toner, and lost weight.  I'm still having problems walking.  It's weird that I can do these Yoga moves, and when I go to walk it's like navigating a cavern with no lantern.  Even raising my legs to get in the car is bit of a challenge.  I'm glad my friend recommended your videos because I believe these moves are helping with me recover.  I just don't do anything that hurts me (bridge poses), I just do the boat one for as long as you are doing bridge poses.

Up until this point I have noticed the ways in which you tend to be very inclusive in your language with regards to gender and identity.  In this video though when you talk about your friend who said you have a ""man voice"" - I wanted to point out that there is no such thing as a ""man voice"" and that language could be offered with a more inclusive spriit. There are deeper voices that belong to people of ALL genders. Your friend seemed to imply that having a ""man voice"" was a bad thing? What about the many trans women whose voices resist changing and have a deeper voice? they are woman. So are you. I hope you will speak with your friend and also reconsider this comment!

172.0,I started your 30 day yoga camp because I was recovering from my hips being off and god love the chiropractor for adjusting me !! But I just could not get back into the hard core workouts I had been doing beforehand!!!  And it surprises me even though I'm not that flexible that I love this little yoga camp I look forward to doing it everyday!!! Now I really don't know if it's enough of a workout each day but to feel totally amazing at the end of a session must mean it's doing something super good for me !! So there are a couple of days out of the week I'll try and do a harder workout before hand and then I just can't wait to finish up with your yoga camp video !!!!

225.0,"Sweet dear Adrienne, you've releaved my vision of the Present.
I do the 30 day of yoga every morning as the first step of my day. 7 am like a warrior, 22h like a yogi, I do yoga with you.
This morning I trusted myself, and I did, but I knew that it will be a shitty day anyway.  I was not ALL here, a cutie grey cloud was over me. 
And it was ! Seriously it was, but I trusted my self and I followed my instinct all day. I made a decision, I choose myself instead of an other contract for work. Like a sunshine, this gift to myself was a big pleasure to live. I decided to remake the video of the 12th yoga day. And now, only now i felt what it is to really trust my self. I felt the energy of this flow you've created for us. And thank you because of my sensibility and your yoga, I felt a big hug to myself. I felt this love for myself as a healthy way of living. 
So thank you to teach me all this spiritual gymnastique. 

AnaÏs.

After finishing the practice I laid down for a bit more and started to accept all these feelings and where they comming from. I realized that I still have issues with my body... You see, I weight at around 210 lb and some poses are more of a mental challenge rather than a physical one (I now realize that) because it's about trusting my body and how strong and flexible can potentially be. After reading all your comments I felt truly inspired and, Adriene, your words and videos truly motivate me. So I decided I won't give up and I will try until I get that crow pose.
