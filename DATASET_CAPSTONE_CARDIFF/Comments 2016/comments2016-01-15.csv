61.0,"👋 Hi all! Man, it's so crazy to see how time flies when you are truly invested in things and/or having fun. It almost feels like there is a certain ease to life if we are willing to just let go, have fun and be a little uncomfortable by being open to new things. Lots of good things happened today: in particular the Half Moon expression manifested through me. It wasn't long ago that I not only couldn't do it, but I judged myself for gasping for air, being inflexible, etc. But you always remind me/us even that it's all good, find the chill zone, and if not today then another day--but don't quit.

I could say that this success (of expression) took me some number of days; but ""days"" and ""hours"" are such a limited measurement to describe mindset changes. What could be a day of practice might be multiple dimensions of travel inwards towards changing our inner voice, developing the courage to express ourselves, and so many other good things. So much gratitude for you to always helping us stay here and encouraged. The quote I have for today is ""The storm is in our mind, but not in our lives."" I really vibed out with everything you said today (and every day really, but today I nodded my head so much like I was listening to a great hip hop beat lol).

When your Camp began I could not do many poses that require putting weight on my knees or using leg strength (like plank and table top) and now I am closer to being able to do most of them. Camp, together with physical therapy three times a week, diligent practice on my own at home, and the goodness of the universe, have really catapulted my healing. As I reflect midway through camp, the MANTRAS (love your emails where you elaborate) are super crucial in this healing process and YOU just being you, your healing, happy, spunky self is also huge! Thank you for reinforcing this mind-body connection -- it really does make all the difference in recovering more quickly and in transforming on a soul level. Thank you a million times.

Just like another posed that I'm usually able to do, this one was very shakey today and I was not able to stay very stable or in the pose like I know Ii'm able. Then it dawned on me, that my body has been changing since I've been doing yoga. I believe it's the old muscles that used to support the pose, are now being supported by the right muscles and they now have to be trained to be in the pose. I could feel the weakness in the glute areas. I don't feel as frustrated as before as I realize this.

I found it really challenging to get on my mat tonight..Glad I did though, I find it hard to know to adjust to keep from hurting myself.

I love your playfulness and how you really explain things so even this newbie to yoga can understand. I find myself wanting more and most days do three yoga sessions! I'm even meditating better, not getting squirreled quite as often. I love always coming back to my breath and in the present moment! I'm hoping this will help me with my ultra running journey as well, being more balanced!  Who knew! Thanks again!!",UgjDDKbDpPYwengCoAEC,0.0,27.0,2016-01-16T17:56:20Z,0.9996566772460938
