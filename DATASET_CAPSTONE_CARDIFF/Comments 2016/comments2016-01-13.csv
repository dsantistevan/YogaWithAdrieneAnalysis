37.0,"I have to admit that I had real trouble with today's mantra ""I deserve"".
Normally I can latch onto something when reciting Adrienne's daily mantra, but today I'm stumped.
""I deserve"" sounds selfish or arrogant to me. Why should I deserve anything ? Do others not 'deserve' as well?
Please forgive me , I'm not trying to cause controversy , but for me this is a tough one and I'm wondering if anyone else feels this way?
I can get into "" I hope for"" or ""I would Like"" or even ""I'm working towards"". 
But ""I deserve"" sounds entitled and exclusive.
I know that 'Adrienne nation' is made up of all types but we all have one thing in common. We are trying to better ourselves.
So if someone out there can help me to feel OK with feeling like ""I deserve"" something I would appreciate it.
I can't get over the ""I"" part and I don't know why.
Like ""I deserve to be loved"" brings on thoughts of ""Doesn't everyone deserve Love?"".
I'm probably overthinking it but I can't think of anything that ""I deserve"".",UgzjfBdKsQ_rzCQoL4F4AaABAg,5.0,0.0,2020-12-18T23:06:44Z,-0.9971821308135986

In the beginning when you asked us to see what's going on with our body, then sang it, I was like ""did she do a Marvin Gaye reference? I need to stop thinking this much."" Kept it somewhat together until the ""foot massage in bed"", and of course when you channeled your inner Khia. Amazing friend, thank you for the laughs 🙌 The word choices today also had me chuckling like an idiot and I struggled to get my mind out of the gutter, but it helped me keep my mind off of soreness!👌Your inner thug life and deep romantic R&B have such balance, I hope one day to balance my chakras to that level of Marvin Gaye/Khia.

- I have realized I have become CONSCIOUS about my body. I've noticed it not only during the yoga class but also since I woke up in the morning.
It was weird for me because I always feel that I am out of control of my body. Despite of this, today I felt that my movements (and even my 'just being') were following the same rythm/path as my mind. It's been a pleasent surprise.

- I still can't feel myself 100% connected to my spine but I can see that along the yoga camp this will change.

It's a tricky one, you know... because if you say you deserve SOMETHING, and you don't get it, or someone prevents you from getting it, you build up resentment. Then there's egoic thought cycles about the world or others preventing you from getting what you deserve.

First of all, I want to say thank you. I've been following you and your teachings for about a year now and I've grown so much in my practice both spiritually and physically. Thank you for your gift of teaching and lightheartedness. But I also want to ask you for your advice. I'm very passionate about health and wellness and I'm currently in school for Human Nutrition with a pre-med track. I've began to save money to go to a yoga instructor school because I feel like becoming an instructor would be an amazing way to start my career and to have a job that I can do while still in school. While I'm saving, do you have any reading suggestions or other kinds of practices I can look into to begin my own yogi journey? 
Thanks so much!

So tonight before working out and yoga, I made homemade apple crisp for afterwards as a treat since it's Friday night. Anyways for this yoga session's mantra of ""I deserve"", you said it could be a pizza party so I kept saying I deserve apple crisp... Haha. Anyways in the middle of this video, I politely started to ask you if we could speed things up so I could get to the apple crisp, but the very exact second that I said hey Adriene... You said ""Quiet""... I pretty much rolled over laughing. It was perfect. I guess you told me! I finished the video and NOW it's Apple crisp time. Thanks for the laugh!!
