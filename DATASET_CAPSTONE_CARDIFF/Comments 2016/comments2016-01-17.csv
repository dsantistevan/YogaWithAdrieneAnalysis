Thank you so much Adriene, loving your video series so much. 
This is my 3rd 30 day series I've tried so far and I'm so in love with them and how they bring motivation and inspiration into my days. 

As someone with ADHD, having the mantra ""I am focused"" was so powerful for me. I'd been procrastinating on completing some of my tasks that I've been needing to do and I really feel like this practice this morning will definitely help me find the focus I need to complete my overdue tasks for the day. So thank you for giving us your time, I feel blessed to have shared my time here on the mat and will continue to carry this mantra into my day. <3 Namaste.",UgyOWqChDncAEFweRwZ4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2021-09-02T16:46:57Z,0.9997803568840027

23.0,"First time I felt so internally calm during yoga. Don't know if that makes sense, but normally my mind can still distract me with a random thought or another to-do. And today most of the practice I was just feeling calm. Loving this journey, mainly for how I discover little things about my body the more familiar I get and the more I learn to listen to my own body. 
And just to be realistic for everyone who might read this: those little breakthrough or discovery moments only happen sometimes. There are also practices where my mind keeps going, or when the thoughts about my body are mainly negative, or when I feel like I'm no where close to the original pose. But those little discoveries make it so nice to continue the yoga journey!",UgyDrQ3R2C0n8brNMrt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-10-20T15:41:00Z,0.9981642365455627

57.0,"üçÉ I am focused on progress not perfection üôè I think today was the first day I felt a synchronicity between my breath and movements--couldn't distinguish one from the other! When I woke up today to get ready for weight training, my body was in a bit of a funk, and combined with the disappointment of missing practice yesterday, I was going to force myself to go lift to clear my mind. But over the weekend, my mind and body were both recovering and going through their own individual healing processes; so I realized maybe I need to slow my roll because it's only been like two months, and I'm trying to do everything again! Health and emotional growth (and I guess life in general) are seldom linear, and sometimes I forget that when I get momentum in different areas of my life. This practice really helped flush out my mind and body, and practice is done. So I mean, practice is done, I feel tons better and I am reminded not to be a slave to my momentum or perfection, because the former can be blinding and controlled and the latter is an ideal that isn't real.

Anyways Question; When we sit in a posture this long my sides really ache, strain, and pull.

Three months of yoga and breathing and connectedness meant that I could forget about a bad knee and just focus on the fun! I was literally breathing and repeating on the chair lift, which was terrifying btw, and I could connect to the beauty and forget all of my fears. You have taught me so much.

Yesterday I didn't do that and tried to move with everyone else and wow, it hurt this morning. Thank you so much for taking the time to show us what yoga is really about. Thank you for being yourself and loving what you do. It really shows! You have taught me more about yoga and myself than any of those other teachers. Sending you and all yoga campers love.
