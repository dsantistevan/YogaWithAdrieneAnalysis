81.0,"What an excellent practice! Loved this one today. 23 is my favorite number and as someone with ""attention issues"", focusing ON focusing is a big part of my life. 

Just saw my best friend from college last night and all I can think about this morning is my social anxiety and how awkward I am. When Adriene said, ""where attention goes, energy flows"", I thought of how my negative thoughts about myself are turning last night's experience into a negative one for me. For the rest of the day, I will try to focus my thoughts on gratitude that I got to show up and see her. 

Wonderful practice; this is one I will be repeating.

The first night I did one of your quick 7 minute bedtime videos before bed, the next night I did my own flow (which I've never felt able to do before so that was amazing!) and as part of it I did happy baby and couldn't even keep myself upright, I kept rolling over to the right side. Heyoooo scoliosis good to see you! So yesterday I went to the chiropractor for my monthly adjustment and then took a break yesterday to allow my spine to heal a bit because it's always a bit sore the night after an adjustment. Then this morning I finally returned to the morning practice (hello breakfast for once as well) and it feels SO GOOD to return HOME to this. To yoga, to myself, to my morning breathing lots of love in lots of love out. 
Of course this practice was absolutely perfect for an after-spinal-adjustment day haha.

My yoga happy-place is Kripalu in Massachusetts :)  I knew I needed instruction, accountability, and challenge.  I lost my mom in February of 2019 (we were buddies)...and this last year has been one of busyness, some weight gain, and a diagnosis of a hiatal hernia (small), GERD, and some esophageal inflammation.  I am on a safe med for the GERD...and my vegan diet is serving me well.   But the yoga!!!!  with you!!!   About two weeks into the series, I realized I was heartburn-symptom-free :)   Now, I'm not sure it's the yoga...and you...but I'm thinking there's a connection :)  My husband and I spent the night in Austin in late December...on our way to my nephew in San Antonio.  If I EVER return to Austin...I would love to take a live class with you.   You have been perfect for me...the right amount of challenge and rest, your loving style, your voice...

I discovered Yoga with Adriene when I was looking for some online yoga videos because my neck was getting really bad and my pants were getting tight from all the snacking while working from home! I used to do in person yoga classes but it's been several years (and I wasn't much more than a beginner then) because I went back to school and I still do work and school full time. Also... just starting menopause.  Anyhow, this ""return"" thing instead of ""transform"" is an interesting concept and it was hard for me to get there. But now instead of obsessing over how my body is changing for the better I am focusing on making peace with my body and making peace with getting older.  Oh, and after today's practice I went from barely being able to move my head from neck pain to total full movement with absolutely no pain - not even a twinge.

I hope you find yourself well. Every day now for 23 days I've been beginning my day with you and Benji & I feel f****** fantastic.

Totally transformative dude....anyway, I wanted to send some good vibes your way all the way from Berlin and thank you.
However, I fear day 30, like what should I do next to gain more strength? I could also make an effort to check your channel, true true.

Too many Grade 8 student issues, job changes (learning to teach online, etc, etc), though doing other Tai Chi & QiGong things in the meantime, and then there's this COVID pandemic. All causing me to feel, the last thing that I have right now is FOCUS, though the theme of ""HOME"" still feels right. Finally, did it today, remembering ""wherever you are when you come to the mat, it's all good."" Thank you, Adriene, for keeping it simple!  Though, in the first 5 minutes found myself crying for no particular reason -- except that just happens sometimes when you go for days/weeks without direct human contact.

While doing the eagle pose, I focused on one point. On my breathing. On my ability to remain in the pose itself. But I would be lying if I said I wasn't thinking about the rewarding relaxing pose you would make us go into afterwards; it definitely kept me going. Anyway, thank you, Adriene!

But my shoulders are showing, some fatigue and discomfort and little to no flexibility,left over right in eagle pose was fine-ish, but right over left- no bueno. So I would like to learn some poses, exercises etc, that may assist in some shoulder flexibility without putting too much strain on the shoulders. I really appreciate your willingness to show the 'stages' of a pose, for example the crossed arms vs. the full twist in the arms.

I'm going to try putting more energy into positivity & self-love tonight (and beyond).
I already couldn't believe how strong and capable I felt doing tonight's practice vs. where I was when I started on Day 1. Focusing on my breathing alone has already impacted my life off the mat in so many interesting ways, including last weekend, when I shot a gun for the very first time at a range & managed to calm my nerves AND hit the bullseye 4 times by tuning into my breath!

482.0,This was a good one! Adding this to my yoga favorites playlist. My first time doing the standing eagle pose without falling on my right said. Fell on my left but almost made it! An improvement. This is my second 30 day challenge. Did the 30 days of yoga last year before Thanksgiving. Did some random videos for the rest of the year but just wasn’t as motivated and focused. I saw what a difference it made it my life to have and then not have a daily yoga practice. So my New Years resolution is daily yoga. I broke my glasses yesterday as I set them on the floor and then crunches on them during on pose. Whoops! But I was back at it today with my taped together glasses and all. Feels wonderful.

I’m definitely in the habit of daily sessions now and will be continuing even after the end of this 30 days!

Today was a little colder and overcast, and I spent most of the day laying around in a blanket. At 9:01 tonight, I jumped out of bed so I didn't miss my practice. Thankfully, I got it done and I'm now warmer than I have been all day. I was a little shaky on my eagle legs, but I was able to hold it for a few breaths before I had to reset; today ended up being one of my favorite practices all month.

587.0,"Here's a little something to deepen the idea of focus:
""Focus"" in Latin translates to ""HEARTH"".  
And the goddess of the hearth was Vesta.. Hestia for the Greeks.
She was not personified (no statues) but rather an imaginal figure.
Here's what Barbara Kirksey concludes in her essay on Hestia:
""As part of the archetype of the journey home to the hearth,
focusing is the experience of and connection to Hestia,
builder of the house, so that the soul may dream in peace.""",UgzpAyZ4i5uAeY7K5B14AaABAg,0.0,60.0,2020-01-24T18:37:15Z,0.992449164390564

Through this journey I have reconnected with family I previously would not speak to. As they are known to have abusive tendencies. I had a disagreement with one of those family members last night and in this disagreement I actually forgot that when people dont get what they want they tend to hold onto it and carry a sense of heaviness because it is hard to release negativity. Having been on my spiritual path for a couple years it's become common place for me to communicate what i need and i am not scared to set my boundaries with people who once terrified me. It's just interesting to me how behaviors that were once so common to my state being are now coming up in others and i am seeing their heart closed, heavy and unwavering in this sorrow the body insists on holding onto for dear life. I am proud of myself and I feel through embracing connections with those I can only love from a distance that I am learning not only about how I used to be with a new sense of clarity but I am learning I have grown stronger in the work I have been doing to consciously soften. I dont worry about judgement from these beings anymore, I dont make myself small for anyone anymore and it is so empowering to see the evidence of this. I wouldn't be on this journey if I hadn't found YWA over two years ago, so thank you for carving your light into the world. It has made such a difference for me on my journey.
