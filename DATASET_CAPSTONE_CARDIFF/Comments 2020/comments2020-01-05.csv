1.0,"Great practice, thank you Adriene.
I appreciate that this practice had plenty of challenging core work and extended poses. That reminds me that softness is not just for relaxing times. Softness can be found even during chaos and hardship. 
Just sitting still eventually hurts my back. I appreciated how much lighter I felt in the seat at the end of the practice compared to the beginning. It's lovely to know that I can sit down and trust the practice will have an impact on me (on or off the mat, as was mentioned today)",UgyCuiUr_XeTXIaQ_ZZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-07T04:31:26Z,0.9994122982025146

So I've started to HOME journey :) On the first day, I was like ``omg ! my body, and soul really missed yoga! I do feel better and some moves don't even hard like before``. and today I'm on the 5th day.

I never thought I'd be writing this but reading everybody else from the community share made me say something too.
I am going through a little rough time and there are days where you just feel low and you don't exactly understand.

I have done yoga on and off for about 10 years and for different reasons, in these past few years, I've found it challenging to practice. But after experiencing burnout, I have stopped working completely and am now building my days as it feels good and every morning I start with you. I've done enough yoga to be able to guide my own independent practices, but I love practicing with you and easing into it again, as I tend to want to overextend myself (in every sense of the word), something I am unlearning. Thank you for this journey, and I'm so grateful that you're guiding me on this path back into conscious movement and connection to the breath and heart.

206.0,"This may sound sappy, but here it goes. This is my lil' Canadian yoga story.

I started doing yoga with Adriene in early August, so this is my second 30 Days challenge with her. I started because my 27th birthday was at the end of July and upon seeing a picture of myself, on my birthday, sitting in a lake and enjoying myself, I burst out crying. COVID-19 has been hard on all, myself included, and seemingly every summer I do get body image issues more so than the rest of the year and this summer was particular bad due to the added stresses of Miss Rona.
So in retaliation, I bought myself new walking/running shoes, a yoga mat, and yoga block.
Now this marks my 35th, or so, day of yoga and I'm also walking a few kilometres everyday.
I'm not overweight, (27F, 5'9"") a bit chubbier than what I would like and I know that I want to tone my muscles more. My weight, per se, has not changed, though my goal to start would be to lose 15 lbs. I know that it's not good to focus on the numbers, for as I lose fat and gain muscle, the numbers won't necessarily go down.
All in all... I've noticed how much my flexibility has improved, for instance: now I'm able to do positions that before made my arms shake. These days, I WANT to do yoga, I WANT to go for my walk. Routine and habit achieved!
Today, as Adriene was near the end of this video and was saying to inhale and ""lift"" yourself, whatever that might mean, I admit that I started to cry. NOT sad tears, but HAPPY tears!
I feel great! Sure I'm not at my ideal weight and sure, my thighs are bigger than what I'd like, my belly has a bit more pudge than what I prefer, but I feel great! I have an incredibly, loving, and supportive boyfriend, we're moving to Niagara Falls next month, I'm a Masters student at Western University, and okay, the world might be on fire, but I feel fine!
I can't wait util I'm able to say, ""Oh I've been doing yoga nearly every day for [3 months]/[6 months]/[A YEAR!!]""

I have learned so much about myself in the past 2 years of practicing yoga almost daily. I am 63 and yoga has changed my life for the better.  It is such an enlightening experience to really get out of your head and realize how wonderful life can be if you just learn how to breath and walk thru life with a more positive attitude.  For a while I was telling everyone I knew about how life changing it was for me.  I decided most people have to find it for themselves when they are open to it.  I wish the entire world starting with children would practice yoga daily.  I think we would have a much happier existence if all could experience the beauty of the peace and strength you can find within yourself.

I didn't know how much I was withholding from myself by saying ""I can't"" until I started practicing. I want my body and mind to work together, but I feel that I am mentally fighting myself every step of the way!

508.0,"I am really enjoying doing these practices and I look forward to them everyday! But I'm wondering if I'm doing a couple of the most used poses correctly as a complete beginner. 

Firstly, the Forward Fold:
What is the main focus of that pose? straightening your legs fully or nicely folding you back? Also, do you need to support yourself on your arms or are they there just to stabilize yourself? 
Secondly, the Downward Facing Dog:
Is it more important to straighten your legs and flatten your feet or do you need to try and straighten your back more?

I am drastically late to the party as usual, but have to ask - has anyone else had a minor manly squeal of joy when they see Benji? :) 

Equally so, I in a weirdly vein way have been avoiding yoga the last few weeks / months. Fear of not having enough time, being too tired, etc. But in real truth. I kinda suck at yoga. I don't have the best balance, it tires me, and I have to do a lot of alternate moves but with that said.... it is good for me. It helps my mental health and gets me back to the person I know I am :)

696.0,"Dear YWA community, I feel like writing something myself today. This practice was hard for me, I was nervous for a small failure which had just occurred and I hoped to find peace in this practice, but I didn't. Sometimes softening doesn't come easy to me and usually when I have tension in my body, I find it hard to breath properly. So, in this practice I faced both of these personal small difficulties and after some minutes I started crying. I didn't expect that, but I took a break from the practice and went on crying. I needed to cry because I'm going through something difficult: a long distance relationship. I live in Italy while my boyfriend lives in Germany, but since 6 weeks he's on holiday in his country, South America. He was supposed to come back on the end of March and we had to meet and the beginning of April. The plan was to spend 10 days together finally. But because of the virus all flights from his country to Europe has been canceled and right now I'm feeling really bad in some moments. Suddenly I feel the urge to cry and I do it so desperately that I have pity of my own heart. I know we're both suffering about this painful situation but we show it in different ways and we don't talk about it. I guess both of us are scared.

I've always appreciated reading the comments of some members of this community, sharing they're personal life experiences, but never really understood why they were doing it. I think I'm now starting to understand one of the reasons why some members do that. I'm sharing this because I hope that telling someone about the small load that my heart is bearing will make it easier to cope with it. And a part of me also hopes some of you could have some suggestions for me üôè

also even tho today's practice was to soften, it was the hardest for me, which i'm greatful for, because i got your point on finding soft moment while doing hard work very well. and also i noticed that things i'm doing can become much much more softer and easier, not rn but at least i know now.

and i'll be more mindful for not  working harder than i need too, i'll trust the process and go with the flow, just doing the right needed amount of work, and things will work out (hopefully lol)

791.0,Adriene thank you so much for your guidance. Is it because I'm chubby that I can't put my foot between my hands after plank? Usually it takes me like 4 seconds to reposition myself so that I can get one foot between my hands and the other extended behind me. Will this come in time?  It doesn't seem to be an issue with flexibility. Also the knee to nose and elbow from downward dog is impossible for me.

925.0,"I really enjoyed and appreciated the questioned you asked, ""where in your body, or mind, are you putting in a little more effort than necessary?"" it opened up so many realizations for me. Like, for example I am such an introvert and can have social anxiety from time to time, asking too much about myself in my mind and my body starts to stiffen, which leads to me avoiding the issue at all costs. But just being conscious about it, can soften things so much already.

And made me doubt if I'm capable of soften that mental rigidity, all that I find hard every single day.
 My body struggled too with this particular one, but I could accept that. I realized I couldn't accept that struggle so easily in my mind. I couldn't help crying during that final swaying plank.

I have suffered lower back problems all my life, especially in the last few years and just accepted that low levels of pain and stiffness were going to be my every day reality, I've been to the physio and ostepath many times and it never really helps me long term. When I started in December, I hadn‚Äôt done any exercise for 2 years, I couldn‚Äôt even sit up straight while cross legged, I needed a tall block to sit on and I was still slouching. Today I was sitting tall and strong, without any blocks! I can do a strong plank now without the shakes, I even surprised myself with getting my feet flat on the ground for the downward dog (and not rounding my back). The back pain has slowly disappeared, today there has been no pain at all. It‚Äôs been a real breakthrough day/session today. Weirdly I think the hip opening exercises in many of the videos have really helped with that, I used to be so tight in the hips.

I not able to pull my belly button up because my stomach is so big and it feels like I am not able to take long inhales because my stomach is big and preventing me. Is that normal? I am carrying an extra 80lbs that I've been working to get off for 7 years, hormones/menopause has messed me up completely. I used to be able to breath in on a 20 count but now I have to breathe faster which seems to make my yoga practice so much harder to do. Will this change? will I lose weight and be able to do the moves like pulling my belly button up and arms into runners stretch on either side of my thighs, or pull my also large butt back into baby pose.. I'm having a rough day with all of this, maybe tomorrow will be better..

It continues to be a good challenge and I feel like I'm achieving so much in my physical wellbeing and personal life. Thanks for being an inspiration. And I must say, Benji is the most chill dog ever and he brings me so much happiness to see him go in and out of frame and just live his best life haha.

How your feelings can shift so fast. Or maybe that's just me. Maybe I un/subconciously put a lot of meaning in my practice, in the theme of the practice. So, yes, maybe I made it worse by not being able to soften myself, which I wanted to. I need to soften myself, soften my negative thoughts, soften my body instead of making it harder for me. I will do my best to integrate that vocabulary in my everyday life!!!

We all hold tension in such small ways that a practice like this really helps to bring awareness to that tension, even if its unconscious.

This has been an everyday practice for me, knowing when you let my body protect me and when it the right time to give in to all encompassing peace.

Thank you for showing me where my physically and energetic attention needs to go in order for me to best honor you and my highest self. üôèüïâ a fantastic mantra I've been using was taught by beloved Baba Ram Dass. It goes: The power of god is within me. The grace of god surrounds me. This is the perfect example of that protection followed by allowing softness. Saying the word power with powerful energy, and softening when saying the word grace. Incredible alchemy of the heart. This practice has been fantastic, it has reminded me of my presence and loving awareness I am capable of bringing to the table through out my day, off the matt.

Today was a little hard for me if I am being honest, my period came in for its monthly visit, I have a flu so I can't really breathe, I am stressed, my wisdom teeth are currently growing so my teeth REALLLYY hurts, and for some reason my colon isn't really feeling okay, but I still wanted to do today's practice.

 It was pretty hard on my thighs tho had to, if I am being honest straighten for a few seconds or lower my back knee for a bit, I am currently also sweating heavily. But here is the thing, after I finished... I felt so accomplished and happy, like... I did that!  I REALLY DID! And after sitting down while sweating, I had my windows open and this breeze came by.... And oh my god, I felt a small little chill, I felt my body vibrate with energy, my mind just became so light nothing weighing it down, I felt like I was one, and like I was connected to myself, my brain, my surrounding, to you, to every single person doing this right now. Yet, I felt so light... So so so so so so light. Not just light, I felt like I was surrounded by light..... I don't know how to describe this. It was I myself was a breathe, going with the wind.  

 This feeling, it was amazing almost, magical.... This has to be one of my most favorite routines so far.

""Am I working harder than I need too?""

Also, please if you have not considered or are unaware of what is currently occurring in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia with their disastrous scaled bushfires, it is an incredibly stressful situation. More land is currently burning that the country of Belgium and it is only getting worse with our Southern Hemisphere summer has just begun. 
Half a billion animals are believed to have perished, 28 people are believed to be dead, C02 (Carbon Dioxide) emissions that have been released over the months of burning are believed to take the atmosphere a century to be absorbed and processed. 
Here, in New Zealand, the smoke has crossed the Tasman, a journey of 2000kms, and we are now also suffering the effects with breathing problems, polluted skies, and drastic weather shifts. 
We are now beginning to live within an era of climate change.
The best way to help those in Australia is to please donate. 
-The Australian Red Cross
-Any Australian wild animal base (particularly NSW or VIC animal hospitals)
- to the Kangaroo Island Mayors relief fund
Anything, please. Our Australian brothers and sisters need our help. 
To find what feels good, please help us help those who need us.
