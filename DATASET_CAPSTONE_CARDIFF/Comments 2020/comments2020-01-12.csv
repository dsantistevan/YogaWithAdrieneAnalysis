Yours was the first 30-day video I ever stuck through, because they weren't particularly long, pushed me just enough while giving me options to rest if I wasn't feeling up to it that day, and your jokes and warmth just make me feel like you're here helping me through it.

My best friend and I have been doing HOME and Dedication during quarantine, and it really kept us sane during these times and also strengthened our relationship so much by simply talking everyday (even if it was only over FaceTime). This particular day though is special to us. 
When we first did this practice we found it so calming that we joked we would always do it prior to exams (the high school graduands in Germany still have to take the full A levels).
And that's exactly what we did, today was our last time, she has her history final today, and I decided this comment would be perfect to round things off. 
I have been writing this in my head for the last five days or so and I just really wanted to thank you, for you and this practices being a social connector, a glimmer of hope during long learning days, for not making us feel shit about our bodies, for being the calm before the exam and for being there for us.

I was so terribly out of balance and I believe that is how the cancer was able to come into being. Your videos have helped me bring yoga into my days and it has been such a blessing. Easing pain and bringing me into a balance. I have noticed a body awarness that was not there before and it has been a wonderful addition to my healing journey.

I always feel undeserving ov their affection and today I just felt it all at once, that no matter what I think of myself, they love me.

972.0,"Hi Adriene, I really appreciate all that you share with us and I love that you read our comments. Every comment I have ever written has been liked and read by you which I find amazing and quite heart warming. You may remember reading about a little ferret named Chauncey, he joined me again today and was just lulled to sleep by your voice. I wanted to share his story with you and the community because it fits into this theme of ""Home."" Chauncey is a rescue, he was first found abandoned in the Garden Center of a Home Depot when he was just a kit. He was adopted out by a family and for three years was a companion to another ferret. Sadly, when that ferret died, the owners decided they no longer wanted him. He lost both his best friend and his home. He returned to the same rescue shelter as before, but now he was 4. He was considered an older/elderly ferret, which many people don't adopt. He was placed in a separate area from the rest of the ferrets at the rescue because he was excluded from the group. He spent about 6 months after that in solitude, until I adopted him. The fact that this energetic and loving animal was abandoned twice breaks my heart, but I know that he now has a forever home and I spoil him as much as I can so that maybe someday he can feel secure. This journey ""Home"" is as much of a journey for me as it is for Chauncey. It's suiting that my first yoga journey with him is called ""Home"" as I have found my new home at college and he has found his new home with me",UgzA6PhbKUuE___2SwJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-14T03:25:04Z,0.9969973564147949

For years I'd been searching for that "" thing "" that truly embodies self love, exercise and feeling good and when I'd started a few years back with your videos I loved them, but struggled with finding the self love to completely give myself over to the practice. Finally, over the past little while I've been giving myself over to yoga. Practicing daily along with you, but also combining meditation,  listening motivational speeches, eating healthy, and being positive in my outlook in life.  This month instead of consuming alcohol which I used to "" de stress"" multiple times a week, I instead joined a hot yoga studio and am excited to be making new friends and new habits. Thank you so much for empowering us all to be the best version of ourselves.

I ended up meditating in child's pose afterwards and more tears fell on my mat. I thought about drying them, but I let them be. I'm glad that I'm starting to be a part of this community and that I'm not alone. None of us are alone.

1340.0,Back at the practice again this morning! It seems fitting that on a day of nurturing and softness I've come to the decision that may seem harsh to some. I'm deciding to end a romantic connection I've been pursuing because I feel I have lost trust this person and can't see myself returning to the connection with the same openness and vulnerability I had when we began seeing either other. It is through nurturing and homding space for  my being that I am realizing my love needs to be fully directed toward spirit and those important I hold dear on this physical plane. I tend to lose myself in a romantic partner but I would rather abstain from romantic connections than settle for a connection that isnt aligned with my highest self and her way back home. I am excited about reintroducing myself to spirit with a new form of devotion but also nervous to tell this person that it's over as they have fear of abandonment and a fear of rejection. I just wont be with someone who plays games. If someone wants real I'll be over here but I would much rather focus my effort on what's truly important now. Through this nurturing practice I am learning more about myself and my priorities in life. Thank you all for your openness and support. Thank you Adriene for creating such a healing community. üôèüïâ,Ugy4oosYJ5BbCohgEeV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-13T15:24:23Z,0.7812364101409912

My lack of self-care led to a burnout so severe I almost abandoned my field (and life I'd established) entirely. Thankfully, I quit the job that wasn't serving me, started a different job in a different organization, and am now feeling much more satisfied.

1368.0,"I‚Äôve been trying to put into words what YWA has meant for me..
It started back in January 2016; I was newly single, getting used to being on my own and living by myself, and per recommendation of a friend I decided to join this 30 days challenge. 
I was really looking forward to this (‚ÄòYeah, self-care!‚Äô), but quit after just 5 days.. 
I was impatient and I couldn‚Äôt be present. I got so nervous worrying I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòdoing it right‚Äô, I rewatched and redid the poses countless times which, after too many downward dogs, resulted in a weeklong headache. 

Fast forward to 4 years later; I find myself in a similar position, and I‚Äôm doing a second attempt at this challenge. The first 11 days have contributed to a better sleep, newfound strength and appreciation for my body. The challenge is helping me to get out of my head (I‚Äôm HSP) and I feel more grounded every day! I look forward to the new videos, knowing that so many others are committed to the same journey, and I‚Äôve even joined a weekly yoga class to get a little more confident in the poses. 
Thank you, Adriene, for building this beautiful community and giving us all a comfortable platform to learn and grow without judgement (and with warmth and a sense of humor)!

1400.0,"I have so much to say after that delicious practice. First--Wendell Berry's poem has become a mantra for me very often through the last year or so: ""What we need is here."" It weaves itself into my endeavors to create a hyper-local life full of art and good food and community and care. I am in the midst of two inter-related and completely disparate projects. One is imbuing my 2-acre cultivated land with perma-culture practices, and the other is producing a performance of Missa Gaia: Earth Mass created by the people in the Paul Winter Consort and now performed in a lot of different versions all over the world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksWvElS_-nE&list=PLw9KcFk9OmsDGrxBRiej-xrYItlXktaGu is where you can hear one of these community versions. These projects come out of a time of healing I was encouraged into by my wise body--crying our for more nurturing. Somehow that time I gave myself last year has resulted in the energy to engage these two projects which feel so right.  But that's not even all: I've had the privilege of playing for several church services lately and this lyric from a hymn I learned as a child keeps coming up. ""On the stormy sea, Jesus speaks to me, and the billows cease to roll."" Marry all that with some recent study of Aramaic through books by Neil Douglas-Klotz:  What I hear is the essential unity of what Yoga, and Christianity, and probably every other wisdom tradition teaches about finding the king-dom, or queen-dom within as a well of strength from which we can draw as we walk about in our world shining our light.

I brought my coffee and my dressing gown and my blanket and even though I was half asleep throughout I enjoyed the time to Nurture me. Thank you.

Even better, before my yoga I even managed to do a little meditation. @Adriene and all, please have a look to the app InsightTimer, and search for the course ‚ÄúComing home to yourself‚Äù of Sarah Blondin. She has a beautiful voice and I believe this is a perfect add to this yoga journey and above all, allows us even more to come HOME. Enjoy the ride and have fun, every day ‚ô•Ô∏è.

So, the blanket was warm, fuzzy, and soothing. Again, I was a little sore because of running last evening. And come on Adriene, ""breathing bolster"", I mean come on. How much cuter can the yoga practice get? Sigh! When will I have a breathing bolster? XD. Well, thank you for this practice. I am grateful.

I didn‚Äôt realize until just now that I don‚Äôt feel very loved in my life - and that can very much just be my impression and not how the people in my life feel - but knowing that I feel a lack of love I think will be helpful. Moving forward I will look for love, I will spread more love, and I will wipe these tears off of my face.
