13.0,"I can usually immerse myself in breathing, movement, and the present moment, no matter how hard it is outside of the mat. but today I'm showing up only at eleven in the evening, because of taking pills I had to eat shortly before, and today my mental health suddenly showed another fracture.
so today it was different. at first, I still wanted to give everything, as usual, but when Adriene said about breathing fire, I felt fear, because I knew that I would not succeed as before, and my body tensed. I tried to take a couple of breaths, but after that I just allowed myself to breathe as usual, listening to myself. and when Adriene asked how I was feeling, I looked into myself, expecting to see calmness or acceptance, as before during training, but instead...
anxiety. vulnerability. fatigue. loneliness. for the first time, tears welled up in my eyes right during training. I finished it without pauses, very slowly, trying to remember about breathing and that value is not determined by performance.
it was a good practice, even despite everything that was inside me. especially considering everything that was inside me. thank you very much.",Ugw-Bnnk_Rp0k5rlmWh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-09-05T20:09:27Z,0.7892352938652039

80.0,"I was so scared that it would be full of vinyasa since my period cramp really hurt but boy I was wrong. 

I always identify boost with being all active but I never know that I also need this kind of boost. 

I've been dealing with things like adapting to my first job, finishing the revision for my thesis, making my parents proud and socializing with work colleagues and friends. I easily feel anxious and stress and I often lash out to my loved ones which I'm very ashamed of. I also lack of confidence and afraid of expressing myself that hinders me to achieve anything in life really. Now I am trying to saving in order to get professional help since it's very expensive in my country. So for now, I only can find any free psychological consultation and do some self healing like Yoga. 

So, thank you so much Adriene for your videos that I can easily access. Right now, I am challenging myself with strictly following Home. Of course, not all done fully with intention. Sometimes I wish some session could end faster. There are days when I still lash out when I am stressed out and panic. 

But now, even though I couldn't express myself by crying. I know that my heart feels touched by this boost.

When Adriene had us breathe to ""let go"" and ""reset,"" that helped me. I know I'll be able to pick up my dog this afternoon, and I'm fortunate enough to be able to purchase another pair of shorts or have the broken pair fixed. Normally these things would ruin my day, but I'm not going to let them keep me down today.

I came back to your yoga because my lifestyle was damaging my back and I needed to do something to protect it, but with the thrill of the new year I felt the urge to do them in a row as they came out.

I use to go to a chiropractor for it and come to find out get really bad headaches beause of the misalignment in my neck.

I notice a few times during this series, the volume completely ducks out to emphasize connecting with the breathe - which i think is a terrific idea (i.e. 24:11 ) . My monkey mind, however, tends to wander at these moments, and think that I forgot to charge my laptop and that the video stopped altogether! When instead I ought to be the most in tune with the breath and meditative at this moment.


Just wanted to throw it out there in case others felt the same way, either way I think it's a great concept that maybe could still be accomplished by ducking the volume less significantly.

Breathing deeply into your abdomen is called the abdominal pump and it creates a more intensive vacuum than usual in your body. This increased blood return to the heart and then, by some fancy laws, also increases blood flow out of it. So what you‚Äôre actually doing when you breathe deeply into your tummy is increasing lymphatic circulation (decreasing inflammation), increasing waste disposal from cells, and increasing oxygen flow throughout the entire body.

724.0,"This time I paused a video to experience a complete stillness in Savasana.  I reached a new state here (the state of Yoga), a complete relaxation. At first, I felt like I'm expanding, then I'm shrinking, it took turns. I lost the boundaries of my body, it transformed into honey that is spreading all over. I didn't feel that I'm in control of my body, because I let it go, and all the sensations started disappearing (It felt like I can't move my arm or leg because I don't know where it is:). I allowed myself to go deeper and OBSERVE. 
The area around a third eye was my center. I felt that there is no ""I"". The UNIVERSE is an integral part of me, I AM NOTHING AND I AM EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME.  I'm losing my ""wrapping"", my physical body for a few moments TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE.  It is divine, you feel LOVE, you feel acceptance. You feel free, you don't need anything, because you already have everything. 

Oh, I wish I remembered this every time when I become selfish. I wish I caught myself when I cross a line or hurt somebody's feelings. I wish I respected every living being. ""We are all together, WE ARE ONE!""

A few times before I've already managed to observe a similar state. Maybe 3, 4 times, no more. I'm wondering what a state one can reach, what insights you can get if do Savasana more often OR to increase its duration. The deeper you get, the new states you reach. Something, you've never felt before. 

Guys, if you felt something similar, please, share your experience! Thank you, Adriene, for a wonderful opportunity to return to our true state!",UgznUIbKQmSJFqhjLUZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-22T13:00:43Z,-0.9748758673667908

I see so many people in public classes that rigidly follow the instructor - and I'm not saying that's a bad thing and it's certainly good if you're new to yoga. But practicing with you over the years has truly taught me to listen to my body - to find what feels good ;) - which sometimes makes me deviate from the plan, even in your classes. And I am so grateful for this because while I depend on an instructor led session I can also see the needs of my body for the particular day and in that way always make sure that I fill my cup every single time I'm on the mat. This is something I have also taken in to other gym classes where I feel that I either need to fire it up or take it down a notch.


What I really wanted to convey is that I think it's good to listen to your intuition and not be scared of deviating while in class - or life in general - because that's really what it's all about; adjusting to personal needs. And I have learnt so much about myself and my body through this process. And I think everyone would benefit from ACTING OUT on all their inner needs (the ones that serve the body or the mind in a positive, non-toxic, non-harmful way of course). So, thank you for helping me grow in such a beautiful way and for helping me to develop a better relationship with my own body and getting a clearer connection with my own mind. <3

I hope you see this because the positive impact that you made into my life is priceless to me.
I followed your 30-day yoga challenge as a New Years resolution 3 years ago when I was getting over a divorce, I had no hopes in affording college, no plans for my future, and lived in a roach infested trailer with my mom.
Today I am a yoga instructor in both Vinyasa and Yin, I‚Äôm a massage therapist, and am currently attending college with a business major. My mother and I are living in the state of my dreams (CO) living the best life I never could imagine.
I thank you for pulling me out of that darkness and showing me that yoga is more than just physical discipline.

825.0,"Yoohoo!! I can clearly see my ""Home"" from here. We're almost there everyone. I doubted myself when I got on the mat today due to what appears to be tardiness but then I remembered the principle of ""do it so you feel like it,""  so I am now facing the voice in my head telling me not to do the practice because I'm ""tired"" and doing it anyway. Fight through everybody, this is where the growth happens, at the times we appear to be struggling the most. Thank you, Adriene for the inspiring practice. This is truly a test of faith in myself. I am now even more committed after seeing how far I've come. Namaste.",Ugxp0L_Dodtk5uuKRCF4AaABAg,8.0,176.0,2020-01-22T06:11:43Z,0.9951112866401672
