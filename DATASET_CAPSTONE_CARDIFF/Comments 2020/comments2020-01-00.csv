204.0,"I just finished your 30 days, the  series from 5 years ago. Great introduction to Yoga, i really like your way of teaching and encouraging. I had some hiccups along the way and it took a little bit longer to get through those 30 sessions. Been doing Intermittent fasting and really struggling to lose weight, even paired with doing 30 minutes of physical activity nearly every day. But I do notice my strength.... my arms still look flabby as hell when i wave to people from across the room, BUT i locked myself out of the house yesterday and decided my best course of action would be to lift myself up through my bathroom window that sits at chest height from the ground. This was a difficult task and i said to myself ""SELF... YOU CAN DO THIS... a month of yoga better count for something Self! LIFFFFTTT"". A few minor injuries later i was through the window and not sure how i did it. Then i locked all the windows, cause that's just asking for trouble. xD. 
Now i ask myself, what next? I'm untrained and not ready for making my own way with yoga. I am struggling a little with some of the activities because i have Degenerative Disc Disease, my PT tells me no Bending, Lifting, Twisting,    Pushing, Pulling... every time i do some kind of   twist my spine is like bubble wrap. I'm trying to work through these limitations slowly. I dont know what to do next, so Here i am, about to start your most recent 30 days of Yoga?

In an attempt to fix that I‚Äôm going to take things back to the basics and just try to commit for at least 30 days to doing this challenge, meditate for at least 10 minutes, and find what really makes me happy. Usually I always either get suckered in to big workout challenges and burn out really fast or I just go for long periods of hating the way I look or how my clothes fit and eating to make me feel better.

380.0,"Hey Adriene!! So let me tell you what your yoga videos and your positive vibes means to me: I have been suffering with depression from a long time and even 2020 began with the same negativity- There was no hope left in me, I never smiled from the bottom of my heart, there was always something like a black hole inside me which kept on emptying me, I am overweight for my age which added up to the negativity and I hated myself for probably everything including my body. I was just drifting away in life without realizing my purpose and I even had suicidal thoughts. Then One day, one of my well wishers suggested me to follow your yoga videos while I was having a panic attack. Honestly, At first I thought that she was stupid to tell me to do yoga when I didn't have enough energy to even get out of bed in the morning. She asked me to take up the 30 days challenge. For her, I thought of starting to do yoga, but I followed your weight loss videos and not the 30 days challenge. And my good lord, The very first day everyone around me (including me) sensed a different kind of energy in me which had been vanished for years now. I lost weight fast which made me happier. I have been my happiest self in ages, all just because of you. And today, I decided to take up the 30 day challenge and i found myself searching for weight loss stories in comments and then I realized how much I have been hating myself just for who I am, And now I have decided to do yoga not just for getting me in shape but also for  ""finding what feels good in me."" I am doing it for myself. I owe it all to you Adriene!! Thanks for making everyone feel good about themselves.

You are a lifesaver ...

I am a single guy in lockdown in the UK
I started furlough a month ago and was determined to stay mentally fit even though the loneliness is tough so I thought I need something to keep me fit both mentally and physically and discovered your other 30 days of yoga program

I made myself do it every day even though sometimes I didn‚Äôt feel like it and made it to 30 days .
 I loved your approach to it and the way you encouraged us
I have now moved on to the home course and found that my arms are really weak ( they always have been very thin ) and am struggling to even do the pushups section

I've been going there for 4 years nearly every day. The impact has been really devastating on a lot of our well-beings. I've never wanted to do home Yoga. I like the energy of the class and the community of people.  I'm distracted at home. There is always a dish to wash or a towel to fold...something to wipe down. Today I decided I must return to the mat for my mental well-being.  I went deep into my closet and found my travel mat. I am so excited to start the 30 days of welcome home, and in 30 days my dogs will have their paperwork so we can return home to the USA. This is a figurative and literal journey for me.

The past few months I have been dealing with other things.  For instance: I did dry January which became dry February, I started intermittent fasting and have lost 10 pounds.  But sadly, my Yoga practice has fallen off.  Maybe too many changes at once!  But I am committing to your 2020 journey.  It is just what I need right now to help nurture/cultivate the other positive changes I am making in my life.

I've always felt about these 30 day new year yoga videos, that Adriene could read my thoughts and always chose the right theme for me.

Because I took 9 days off from work  -this week- to take care of myself and my home long before this announcement -in December. 
And there it was... the right yoga to follow. üòé

Im starting this practice a little late only did day 0&1 today after doing my usual ""wake up yoga"" with you hehe but tom i intend to do day 2&3 so the next day ill catch up by doing 4&the current days. I wasnt going to do the whole 30 day challenge just because i didnt start at the right time but as i saw the names of the videos i thought id like to recognize things about myself awaken etc, and in that moment i remembered things come in their time for you so lets do the dang challenge! Well catch up! Work for it a little right anything worth while ya gotta work for and this is just for myself to remember you got this! Anyone else in the same boat YOU GOT THIS! You want something go and get it, fight and work hard for it! I believe in you and so does Adriene and Benji

But yeah i closed my eyes cutting that lemon calm as ever.

1061.0,"Dear Adrienne,

I‚Äôve now been practicing with you for about four years. That spans living in two different countries, three different ‚Äúhomes‚Äù, and such a vast spectrum and mental states. This year was bad for me. Bad for my sense of identity and self esteem. Bad for my sense of hope and trust in others. I had the worst job experience of my life that made me question my place in the world. This series being named Home couldn‚Äôt be more accurate. The only moments I have really felt home this year were when I could squeeze out a few minutes to hop on the mat with you. Those moments were too few, though, and my mind and body feel weary. Hoping this reset to home will help me find myself again buried under all the doubt, stress, fear, and struggle. I can‚Äôt thank you enough for what you mean to me and so many others. May your light shine on forever. 
Love,
Alicia",Ugzu6xPJY-WwvQk8JIN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-02T17:08:24Z,-0.9992918968200684

I'm using movements and remarks from Adriene in my own dance classes and I see my dancers respond very wel to this.

12 months ago I decided to begin my year with you and your challenge Dedicate in real time.

I still struggle, but I have built so much this year passing through my fellings - and your yoga and your kind and impactful presence gave me the courage to do that.

I was so nervous to get back into it, as I had injured my shoulder a while back.    This time I would be extra mindful with my shoulder and the whole of my body.  
Also during this time, I minimized everything, and made no commitments to anything other than yoga, work, home, family.  I wanted to see what needs to be added back to life, and what can stay gone.  
During my yoga sessions, I built up more strength than I imagined in just 15 yoga sessions.  I was able to think more clearly, and.. My body told me that I needed to come back home, that I was capable of sustaining our family in a more healthful way if I was home.  
And then I see the Home 30 days of yoga starting.  Of course.  Of course.  
It's my goal to come back home in February.  
I'm so looking forward to this!",UgzLpzyd8prIL3lmBkF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-01T19:36:17Z,0.9804291725158691

Today as I watched Home's orientation video I had tears of joy streaming down my face. You see in 2019 not only did I complete Dedicate but also every calendar for the whole year. I not only surpassed my original goal but surprised myself with finishing out the year.

1886.0,"I'm 61 and started following the YWA 30 day programs last summer as a way of keeping me on track with practicing yoga daily. I started last year with a serious fall and a badly strained hip. Once I'd finished physical therapy, yoga was the obvious next step. I had other resources, but when I found YWA, I stayed. Can I do all the balance poses? Between the hip and some other health issues that affect balance, not well. But the welcome and reassurance that is always present in these videos is wonderful. The invitation to breathe and be present has provided the space for some needed and welcome self discovery. I am so looking forward to participating live with all of you.

Two days ago while practicing yoga there was this mantra that showed up from nowhere ""I am awake"" and in that moment it ment so much to me.... It's not only that my eyes are open. It means I am open to new things, I am here and ready to be at home and get strong and bold... It took me two months of yoga practice so yoga could kick in again as it always does...

This, YOU  have changed everything for me. I am more ""dancy"" and spritely than I have been in 20 years! I won't give this up. I am committed. It's because you are such an inspiration, such a good teacher, you are so mindful of a positive approach to the body, you are demanding‚Äì‚Äì but in the best way, you are a leader I can follow and I am not usually a follower.

On our way to Disney world we found out that my grandfather passed away and I can‚Äôt describe how close I was to him and how much it hurts me that he‚Äôs gone, he‚Äôs the last grandparent that I had. We found out that my brother had a lesion in his ankle and that it could have been cancerous(I literally cried till there was nothing left in me), both my parents received the news that they had diabetes and that if they didn‚Äôt change their lifestyle they could‚Äôve died. My best friend who is the only person who I was comfortable being vulnerable around moved away and we barely talk anymore. 2019 is also the year that my mental health has been at its worst, my anxiety has skyrocketed, I started having suicidal thoughts(I promise I haven‚Äôt hurt myself or have even tried taking action, they‚Äôre only thoughts), and one of my biggest flaws: anger. I get angry so easily and I try to stop myself but it‚Äôs too much. All I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôm ready to let go and head home.

I just started in a new city for school and don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll go after and how long I‚Äôll be here. Being ‚Äúhome‚Äù for the holidays is also weird because my parents moved out of the place we used to live and I‚Äôve not lived with them for 5 years now. 

I‚Äôve been feeling like an untethered balloon floating through life because there‚Äôs no place or person that I‚Äôm attached to enough to draw me somewhere. I don‚Äôt know where I want to live or what I want to do. I don‚Äôt know how long my life will continue like this, so I‚Äôm hoping to find a home within myself in this new year.
