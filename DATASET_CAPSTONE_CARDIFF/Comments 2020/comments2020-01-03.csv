231.0,I like your style Adriene but the practice is a bit too fast. Also there is no way to do this without  also watching the screen as your instructions are incomplete. I have a stiff neck from trying to see what to do on the screen while also completing the pose. Suggest you have someone do the workout next to you with her eyes closed or her back to you so that you can see how hard it is to follow your clues.

Thank you so so much for setting me on this journey! Ive had hip replacements, and have only half my balance. One ear doesn't work. Ive looked at people at my gym going off to do yoga but in 7 years have not been brave enough to try! ( I did aqua aerobics).
My daughters have done the challenge and encouraged me, so Ive begun! Im 68 but already feel so much more awake and in touch with my body.

I will get to day 30 when I get there, and it's okay if it's not with ""everyone else."" 
This is my practice and it doesnt need to match anyone else.

1282.0,"Adriene, thank you for being in my life. Seriously. You've been here for me for 5 years and whenever I need to be healed. This 30 Days of Yoga practice 'Home' is very special for me because though I've known you for 5 years I've never started to do a routine that takes 30 days to finish. I have gone through a lot in 5 years; depression, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, worst nightmares, getting stuck with bad version of myself every time I try to get better and those therapy sessions which I talked about my love for Yoga. You put Yoga love in me, Adriene. I hadn't realized how Yoga is a part of me. Now after very worst years, I still haven't connect with me properly, yet. Today was a hard day. I couldn't wait to get back home and do 'Awaken' part. I cried at the end of the routine. I wanna be better, the best version of myself. I know I'm worth it and I know everybody who came to their mats with hope is worth it. We are strong enough to be the best of ourselves. Although I cannot complete what I've started mostly (which seriously one of my biggest problems), I'm gonna change it with 'Home' practice. I'm taking this road to discover my Home and I'm so happy that I'm doing it with you.

1332.0,"As I rose to standing with my hands together at my heart, I could feel the prana pulsing through my being, my physical body shaking, my soul ignited, like a spark held to old kindling. A surge of emotion took over, and after taking in another deep breath, I surrendered to the emotion and began to cry.

So there I am, body trembling, sobbing, breathing, being. For a moment, I was so caught up in this surge that I completely forgot about where I was and what I was doing. I cannot recall a time that I have felt alive in this way before. It stirred up an intriguing curiosity that I am so excited to explore. 

Tomorrow will mark my 250th consecutive day of YWA. My journey has been indescribable. I am so eternally grateful for you and all that you share with the world, Adriene Mishler! 

This practice made me feel, in the truest and sincerest of ways, awakened.

1342.0,"Dear Adriene and Community, 
I fell in love with YWA with a Valentine‚Äôs workout in I think, 2014. I love the 30-day journeys. I recently stopped doing yoga for about six months, following a tough breakup. I took up running instead. I probably needed the yoga even more then, but I was already spending too much time in my head. 
I am so happy to start the year again with YWA and a 30-day program. The progression and flow are always inspired and at the end of the 30 days, I know I will exalt in the blessing. 
I am on Day three as I write this and now, it is time to let my inner and outer worlds come together. I am ready to awaken and yes, I have shortened muscles and stiffer joints but the YWA effect is immediate.  I am now ready to find again what feels good and get rid of the stagnant! 
I am already standing taller and feeling better, my body awakening, connected to the whole, and coming home to a better me. 
Thank you for the guidance and the community. I do feel like I have come home to a real worldwide community envisioning and enacting on the creation of a peaceful yet challenging adventure into a better future. It gives me great hope in these highly volatile political times.  20/20 vision.

For me I struggle with staying in the present moment and staying focused, the world will pull me this direction and that direction, and I always want to help when I can. However, I have my own goals and aspirations I want to accomplish and sometimes that takes sacrifice, such as not doing what I would like to do for pleasure to work hard hours toward my goals. Nevermind the feeling of trying to accomplish a real life goal (such as advancing your career) when going through an existential crisis. These videos remind me that everything is okay, and that this time is only temporary, and that there are thousands of other people out there that are sitting right here in this moment watching this video and doing this yoga practice with me -- working on themselves too.",Ugxwhw-d1-Gsy0MxsZR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-05T18:22:33Z,0.9994742274284363

My family is going through a stressful time right now and on top of that we had our last holiday gathering for the season at our house with lots of people. I did not want to get on the mat. I just wanted to go to sleep. I love hosting people and gathering in community but I also find it incredibly draining as I work towards healing myself from hashimoto's. But my husband encouraged me to get on the mat and I'm so glad I did. Usually it takes me days to recover from an event like we had yesterday, and I woke up this morning feeling almost back to normal. This is the reminder I needed, to awaken to nourishing myself instead of collapsing into indulgence. How I move through and out of stressful situations makes a world of difference.

This year I decided to join 30 Days of Yoga, and I'm so glad I did. The swaying movement, although it felt strange at first, was really a turning point in today's practise for me, and it made me feel so free and light, and the rest of the practise went by with ease. My cat even decided to join me on the mat today, which has definitely lifted my spirits.

Missed Day 2 yesterday, meoww! Today was a hard one for me, and in the evening I made my way home with an intention to eat some yummy things and hide from everyone. But I decided to save myself and turn to the support of the body through yoga, and succeeded by diving into Day 2 and Day 3 in a row, rebuilt inside myself the INTEND, and then fully experienced the AWAKENing. 
At 09:50 I just started singing, at the top of my voice, shaking out all the rubbish of the day, relaxing and really waking up - WOW, that was incredible!
I have been with you for several years, and I have found real support in these lessons, and I'm immensely grateful to you. With each new lesson, I learn to hear you better, to hear my body, and to realize how yoga works. And I'm sure - that is only the beggining of the trip to myself.
Thank you for what you do for all of us, thank you for everything you share with us.

1777.0,"Did day 2 really late last night after coming from a shift that ended at midnight. Phew! I think with the theme day 2 - intention - and with having a series of intentions (overall and for the month - I WILL be disciplined and intentional with my time; I WILL complete 30 days of yoga with Adriene in January) guiding me, I've found that there was very little resistance and more presence overall during the practice, even though my brain was a bit scrambled to hone in/focus on anything specific for my late night day 2! Slept like a baby after, though. 



I made it out for a 5k run today and did day 3 after, which was the perfect combination, as my body was already feeling alive and joyful. Today's theme made me reflect back on when I first started Yoga with Adriene. It's startling to realize how numb inside I once was; words like ""awakening"" can be a somewhat abstract concept, when you're in that ""sleepwalking"" phase. Yoga gave me the glimmers that led me to a more intuitive, felt understanding of what it means to be awake in our life. I wish this for every human being, a gentle dusting off of our old patterns, to shine the light in the dark places, and walk through with more wonder and awe.  



And it progresses! This - using the YouTube comments as a sort of written diary of my journey - is an interesting change for me! I've long been a lurker in online spaces. As I continue the journey of awakening, I choose to participate and create, knowing that my contribution is worthwhile :)

I've had more than a few conversations with like minded others in the last month and I've concluded that I'm not insane, but instead frustrated with explaining a different point of view from that of their root views. MY life wasn't supposed to be this Buddhist or Taoist to begin with and after doing simply for others to understand that their issues aren't issues at all, and then having it turn into a gritty situation because of my stubbornness I'd rather just sit in a quiet space as they learn that I'm only trying to help.

The breath doesn't only guide the movement, it also initiates it.  This ties into my intention as well (patience).  I recognized that if I waited to move until the next cycle of inhale or exhale started, the movement became fluid and soft.

1935.0,"Hi First, thank you for all you do.  Id like to comment on the music in the beginning and end of the videos... Because I have a baby asleep in the room next to me, I have to keep the volume down and since your voice is quite low in the video during the practice, I have to raise the volume higher than I normally would.  The issue Im having is with the music coming on with a sudden loud noise, and after every practice I have to immediately jump up and shut the volume off before the baby is woken up by it. So I never have the chance to just enjoy the moment at the end of the practice on the mat.  Before you used to have the little guitar instrument ditty and it was a low, soothing sound, but more recently the music has become much louder and upbeat.  Id appreciate it if youd consider matching your new melodies to a similar volume as your voice so that there isnt this dramatic uptake in volume.

2037.0,"A little Rumi for my fellow yogis on the theme of Awakening: 

The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you.
Don't go back to sleep.

You must ask for what you really want.
Don't go back to sleep.

People are going back and forth across the doorsill 
where the two worlds touch.

The door is round and open.
Don't go back to sleep.

:)

p.s. If there are any other new moms taking care of an infant at night out there, I feel like this theme is even more powerful as we've surely been literally awakened countless times during the night and now it's time to metaphorically awaken. :) Sending you love and support!!",UgxzK5NeKVEnKTUlrFp4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2020-01-04T12:43:21Z,0.9986691474914551

To live in true love and connection I am stopping buying anything with plastic, finding work arounds or simply letting go of certain things. It feels good and painful to awaken in this way.
