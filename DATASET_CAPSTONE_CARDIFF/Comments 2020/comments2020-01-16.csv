Formal prayer and prostration are feeble pursuits.
Fasting has little merit, other than to save food.

Only they go on pilgrimage to Mecca
Who are not wanted at home.

Only they pray loudly, professing their devotion,
Who are deceptive of intent.

But those who have found God‚Äôs Name in their hearts
Care not to fast nor prostrate themselves in formal prayer.

It's a moment of BEING HERE NOW to honor the spirit of Ram Dass and ourselves and each other!
I'll be there and I betcha Adriene will be too!  
Not to be annoying, but I'll post the same thing on more of the recent Home videos, as I'm sure many people who love Adriene would also love to be a part of this, and some people are still catching up.
Since this is the first, and probably last time, I'll ever feel moved to share something like this, I just have to say, as so many others have, how miraculous Adriene's influence has been me. Practicing asana with her has truly changed my life. It has led me into a meditation practice and honestly, a complete transformation of both my inner and outer worlds.
Adriene is truly a guiding beacon of light, and I thank her profoundly in my heart at least once during every practice for being who she is and doing what she does.

668.0,"Thank you Adriene from my heart to yours!
I woke up this morning and had a little aha-moment I would like to share: I think we as human beings are constantly looking for a place, a job, a partner to feel home - in the outside world. But this morning I woke up and it kind of hit me emotionally: girl, stop looking for this feeling of home, cause you are home already. Truly home. Stop finally searching around and just listen and feel and enjoy this inner peace. It is inside of you.
I can‚Äôt tell you how grateful I am for this moment, how strong this feeling was and how peaceful it made me feel. And I know that YWA and the 30-Days-Challenge ‚ÄûHome‚Äú are playing a big role in this realization. So thank you and the whole team for everything you are doing to make things like this happen.
Through you, I am one step closer to myself.

885.0,"Oof, leaving the comfy, warm bed for this AM practice...STRUGGLE.  

One of the mantras I've started this week: One Thing at a Time. Just taking whatever is in front of me and immersing myself in it as much as possible. My thoughts might still run a bit untamed and Lord knows I still get distracted (i have been toggling between writing this and dance party-ing), but still, it's a gentle reminder to return to the moment. 

& I also think that One Thing At a Time helps to... DO things more effectively. Multi-tasking/attention-splitting is a manifestation of the fear that I'm not using my time as productively as I could, so then, it ends up just trying to do one thing, having that nebulous fear that I'm not Doing the Right Thing, then jumping over to another thing...which is, uh...not super-productive. But if I can just accept and savor what is - that this is the thing I'm doing right now and I'll enjoy it - then I can let one moment flow into the next and expand both the ACTUAL time I have and my experience of time, as well. 
So, namaste all! May you step in the flow of life. May your presence be your power, and may you savor every moment for the precious, fleeting, and complete thing that it is, in and of itself :)

You have no idea how badly I needed to hear that. My husband and I just got our financial plan in place to get us out of debt, and I woke up today to the news that our car needs about $1000 of work done. Then I walked into my living room, and our foster dog peed all over her crate. Then I got the call that they discovered a hole in our radiator, so our car actually needs about $1400 of work done. Life was definitely NOT feeling good when I took to my mat this morning, and I almost didn't do this practice until later because I had to do yesterday's video first, since I was sick last night and couldn't do my practice. But YouTube auto-played this video after yesterday's ended, and I figured, ""Why not? I'm on the mat already.""
