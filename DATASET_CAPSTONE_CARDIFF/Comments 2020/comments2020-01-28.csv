14.0,I know all the comments were a year ago but I am enjoying this 'Home' 30 day practice now August 2021. It's 'all' still going on out there in the world and somehow we are all changed. This yoga practice has been such a blessing to me and I am so grateful for Adriene and her commitment to herself and all of those who have joined in this a year ago and since then. Thank you to everyone for commenting as I have enjoyed reading them and is still inspiring today. I feel so much stronger physically and emotionally. I love how authentic you are Adriene. Keep doing what you are doing and especially the 30 day practices. Breathe was my commitment to myself and I haven't looked back. I've made a 365 day promise to myself but really this is now an important part of my self care until I can no longer physically do it.

91.0,"Adriene I know you get so so so many comments, but I really want to put a big 'thank you' out into the universe, even if you don't see it. 
I have been practicing yoga since last November by simply searching how to do a move and then attempting it, maybe adding it into a little flow if I felt like it. I had heard of your channel but felt really apprehensive to try specific yoga videos as a lot of other channels I have tried have felt more like a HIIT session and didn't make me feel great. I found your channel while looking for something to ease my grief and saw you had a session for that exactly. Quite honestly it felt like someone was holding my hand, giving me space to feel sad and safe all at once. I decided there and then to try this 30 day journey Home and I do feel like I am almost there. I don't feel as if I'm searching for a Home anymore, Home is me.

A couple of years ago I was in a severe earthquake, I was a teacher and the building where I worked collapsed, we had to rescue kids from the rubbles and since then I've been very afraid. But I came to practice, and I discovered that not only did I needed the calmness but the reflection too; hearing you on giving back and not only taking away, got me thinking about the earth and the soil below me, and not being afraid or angry at its life but grateful and serving. It was a very powerful experience for me. How do I give back to the ground that supports me? to the soil that I feed from? to the Earth? In the end I was feeling so moved and thankful that it showed me how this journey has changed my perspective on everything. Thank you so much!!!",UgzNTynR4RZDn9bsGd14AaABAg,1.0,76.0,2020-06-24T01:14:44Z,0.9991058707237244

433.0,"Hello dear Adriene,
Today‚Äôs practice was deeply healing for me. But before practice I read your letter and that‚Äôs when the ‚Äúpre-yoga‚Äù began. You talked about staying open to receive the gifts that are coming. And I thought, ‚ÄúI really want these gifts, but how do I get rid of these barriers?‚Äù And it occurred to me that I am doing it now. I feel proud of myself for honoring my commitment to journey all the way home, to feel the feels, as you say. Feeling the feeling, I believe is what dissolves the walls, which are unfelt, hardened emotions. 

I loved today‚Äôs practice because it was something about your energy today. I saw your feelings, and I saw you feeling them (oh, the actor‚Äôs heart! What a beautiful thing!). So naturally I felt my own soul open and soften. I was able to feel subtle sensations inside, and I continued to explore the sense of expansion I was experiencing, after practice. I got in touch with a very vital part of myself that I hid away...but after today‚Äôs practice I allowed myself to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù, the way I used to. 

This emotional breakthrough is so important to me because I am a creative person and I need access to those parts of myself. 

So, thank you Adriene, thank you for You.",Ugx_3Ycw_GxOSNncD3h4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-30T09:14:00Z,0.9994586110115051

636.0,"Day 28: Nourish. This is probably the most introspective practice of this journey for me. I had read the email and the message this practice carries in the day as I always do. So, the whole time I was on the mat now I was thinking about the many ways I was stopping myself to feel better about myself or a certain situation. The many ways I was not allowing certain people to enter my life because of the fear and insecurity of getting hurt again or being used again by them. This practice allowed me to hold those thoughts, pause and think of how far I have come. I have learned so much from those experiences. So, this was an opportunity to tell myself to stop holding back, keep my head on my shoulders, and face everything head-on. Because maybe, maybe this time around I would be better at handling those people or situations. I would be able to set healthy boundaries and get to the other side of the tunnel.

You know kind of like people do with Game of thrones. It's been hard seeing all the episodes come Up and having to wait but I think it will be worth it. Still I cant shake the feeling that this is a naughty thing to do, am I being a bad yogi? Also, do you think I could skip some of the shavasanas when bingeing? It would really help me save some time.

682.0,"Adriene:
I was initially hesitant to begin this Yoga Journey with you; after all, I've never been to a yoga class, and I've only practiced yoga sporadically (maybe 3 times in my entire life).  However, my hesitation melted away to excitement.  I now I've value this time.  I treasure this time.  Yoga is the metaphorical ""chocolate cake"" I get to enjoy for breakfast.  I now understand the importance of breath, stillness, movement, connection, nourishment, and most importantly: the connection between the mind, body, soul, and spirit.  There is a method to the movement (and even the lack thereof in some of the poses), and I deeply appreciate everything you've taught me these last 29 days.  
In fact, I find myself down heartened to realize our 30 Day Yoga Journey is coming to an end.  Now, what will I do with myself in the mornings?  Dare I go back to my hectic routine, or perhaps find another calendar to follow?  Thanks for everything Adrienne.  This practice helps clear my head for the day, and it has helped improve my productivity.  Even in life's most frustrating circumstances, the best thing I can do is focus on my breath.  Thank you again for everything!

She always gives me the feeling of being totally ok the way I am and with how my practice went. On most yoga channels it is so frustrating cause you can¬¥t keep up and even if you do it your way, you feel so frustrated and worthless watching the teachers doing the hardest yoga positions while you are sweating in the easiest ones. I really could feel a lot of changes in my mind and strength in my body, regarding to self awareness, self love, building gentle thoughts and many other things.
