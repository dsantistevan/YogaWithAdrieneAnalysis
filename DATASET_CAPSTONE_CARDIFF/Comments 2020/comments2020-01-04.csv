You would be amazed how often the intention you offer matches what I need on a given day - without me actively searching for it. So THANK YOU.

Most of the time i'm just crying though because finding yourself is very emotional. So thank you for the laughs and cries, i feel very alive. <3",Ugy3wed1Us5jUeV5y4x4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-28T10:08:25Z,0.999739944934845

I've been practicing with you daily for the last 3 weeks. I woke up this morning and it is remarkable how great my body feels. I simply love it. I had to idea I could feel like this. I also never knew one could feel so many different energies through yoga ie I could feel the difference in this workout as opposed to the one yesterday. A little thing that I think is special is the number of times I smile during the routine at your suggestions. That is surely special. Your call to have fun is wonderful.

I'm doing day 4 a day later since I didn't have the energy to do it yesterday, health-wise. I love energy flows a bit more every time that I do them. My energy is awakening and it feels crazy, freakin' good!!!! (Especially today, I must say) It might sound silly but it's like something inside of me is getting activated and it makes me feel like I can do anything, like I can go on without feeling the need to stop! Breathing is even more important during these flows, it truly helps you move in a much easier way. Focusing on my breath tremendously helps me not focusing on my weaknesses and struggles. I might need to work on the ""upward-downward energy"", though, as I'm not sure I really felt them; maybe because it's 2 contradictory things so my brain can't focus on both of them...

1190.0,"Adriene, I had a kind of spiritual experience in today's practice, something I have never ever encountered before. When you said to imagine a current or flow going up front body and down the back body, I immediately pictured white balls of light moving in a current around and around my body in an endless flow, almost protecting me. I immediately started grinning to myself and closed my eyes. I don't know how I knew but I knew the white balls of light were spirits, I don't know what kind of spirits, just that I know that's what they were and they were protecting me and it made me smile through the whole practice.

At the end of the practice in mountain pose, I was smiling and crying and had this overwhelming sense of happiness and joy. I've never experienced anything like this before and I'm not a particularly spiritual person so it was a little overwhelming. I had a sense of nothing else being present in the room except me and the white lights protecting me, guiding me, looking over me. It was a serene and profound experience. I'm fairly new to yoga and this is my first YWA 30 day journey and I am thoroughly enjoying it.

Have you, Adriene, or anyone else ever experienced anything like this while doing yoga (or at any other time)? I'd be very curious to know.

Thank you for your videos, Adriene, and all your words of support and kindness and wisdom. I love your videos, they are becoming the highlight of my day. Thank you <3

1270.0,"HELLO! first of all - the new Benji in the corner icon is THE BEST. everyone should go watch the Good Morning America clip! Benji GOES IN on licking the host's face. he's usually so Zenned out during yoga, so the contrast was a delight. 

I practiced ""ACTIVATE"" this morning although I felt fuzzy and sluggish from the night before - so I felt a bit out of sorts and misaligned with the theme (at least in the AM). 
this day brought some stressful situations. I was projecting some anxiety on to what should have been an occasion for joy (catch-up with friends); my best friend, who lives across the country, was going THROUGH a family crisis; my phone broke, which turned into a 2.5 hour ordeal at the Apple store; & I missed my stop for the train, LOL. 
when I got back, I was ready as hell to ride the Relaxi Taxi, and I got a little toasty, peeled myself an orange, cracked open a beer...and was about to get out my brand-spankin'-new iPhone 8 to fiddle around, set things up (...and we all know how the spiral goes from there), when I thought... WAIT! Activate! 

so, with a little pause and with a little presence, I activated my choice to sit down to write this instead! 

It reminded me of the end of this practice, when Adriene is sending us off with her final message, then takes us into that last chair pose - a little push and, in reward, a generous surge of energy. 

...sort of like this! This reflective part has been super-fun and rewarding, as it gives me an opportunity to express myself and a fresh lens through which to view the day - I wasn't really intending to ""stay"" with the theme, but it popped up at just the right time, when I was making an ""easy,"" more unconscious choice that would have ended up with me feeling a bit ""blah"" and drained in the long run, especially as my relationship with the Internet and devices is a habit I'm trying to manage (consumption vs. creation!). so often, it's the littlest things that can prevent us from starting (i.e. not taking my laptop out of the backpack), but once it's in motion, it's, like, oh, DUH!!! THIS IS WAY BETTER

At 63 I feel strong and even though yoga has changed me physically,  it saved my life and it has changed the way I do everything else in my life. Like showing up! And to always remember the breath. I have a lousy virus so it has been a challenge to start this 30 day journey yet I know it is part of my healing journey.

This morning, I woke up to my mare lame from an abscess. While rushing out to get the means to begin treating it, the transmission crapped out on my car. Got that bandaided enough to get what I needed and get home... only to have the radiator go out, as well. Today did its absolute best to defeat me and I kept telling myself, ""It's okay to not knock out your to-do list. You did what you had to, and that's going to have to be enough.""

But then I thought about how I *can* control whether or not I show up to the mat. And so I did.

This was the most peaceful, most fulfilling practice I've had with you yet, and I kept thinking that it was because I was already so emotionally worn. But at the very end, when you said ""There will be bumps in the road on your way home,"" and then ""You have everything you need,"" the dam broke and I wept out what remained of today's tension all the way through our Namaste. 

I needed this, and you brought it to me. Thank you <3",UgynsMdy29t04MmQuWV4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-01-06T02:42:27Z,0.8877114653587341

I know that would not have been able to do this video on day 1, either due to mental or physical strength lacking but I feel like the journey is making me stronger, making me more capable. I can feel my muscles engaging more and can feel myself slowly getting the hang of things. I swear at one point, my hand had the weight distributed equally in the fingers instead of just in the wrist and it was such a small but significant thing to me. It means that my body is learning and adapting to do things to best help it and I just feel so proud of my hands haha",Ugyl_XfllQCMvWtgbzR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-06T00:39:49Z,0.9840549826622009

Thank you, Adrian, for making us all feel like a part of something, like you're personally welcoming us every time we open a video. I've been watching you off n on for a good year or two, and I'm really glad you've touched so many people and gotten so much support.

If I could ask a question for a moment, assuming that this won't be the last downward dog this month, how in the heck do you hold onto your mat? I don't know if mine is old or cheap or what, it seems rubbery-ish and my mom's mat feels the same, but my feet edge back and my hands slip; I have to grip the edges of it and dig in with my fingernails to feel secure. Could I be doing the pose wrong, or maybe it's because I'm overweight without much muscle? Any advice?",UgxD21rZGo9xIxPpFAF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-06T00:38:24Z,-0.9800252914428711

A surge of emotion took over, and after taking in another deep breath, I surrendered to the emotion and began to cry.

So there I am, body trembling, sobbing, breathing, being. For a moment, I was so caught up in this surge that I completely forgot about where I was and what I was doing. I cannot recall a time that I have felt alive in this way before. It stirred up an intriguing curiosity that I am so excited to explore.

When you move super slow, it's like you're getting the benefits of multiple poses in between each official pose - the muscles get more out of it, as do the joints.  It's like the super slow calisthenics, that takes real strength and control.

A romantic relationship I'm having may be ending and we are currently taking space. In these situations I have been known to get down on myself even if I have done nothing wrong. This yoga is helping me surrender, to honor myself in my process by showing up for myself when it's difficult to do so.

And today was the first time I‚Äôve felt relatively safe ‚Äúactivating‚Äù anything. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs  because of my new found ability to stop gripping, accept where I am and rest when I need or if you have mastered the ability to lead a class that feels both challenging and accessible (it was always that way but seems extra refined now).

I know many of you may be feeling the same. If there is one thing I've learned from Adriene and one thing I know to be absolutely true:  Just...show...up!  Really, truly, it is that simple. If you just lay in Savasana and only listen, Just...Show...Up!  We all have the tools we need - we had them before we started and will continue to uncover them on the journey.  I know you may be achy in the shoulders or sore in the abs - the result of commitment in the days before.  This practice seems to loosen up those spots and makes you feel better then when you started.  It especially improves your mood!  As my Ayurveda Teacher once told me:  ""At some point you become tired of your own excuses"" (for why you can't... fill-in-the-blank). This is the mind controlling the body. It is only when you step back from that voice and view the thoughts as the observer of the thoughts, only then, despite the difficulty, can you do what you know in your heart to be true.

It was immensely encouraging & humbling to notice simultaneously the mental & physical benefits of just a few months of practicing YWA & how these things are manifesting off the mat.

With deep gratitude from Comox, Vancouver Island, BC, Canada


""Every day, 
I see or hear
 something 
that more or less
 
kills me
 with delight,
that leaves me 
like a needle


in the haystack
of light.
It is what I was born for--
to look, to listen,


to lose myself
inside this soft world--
to instruct myself
over and over 


in joy,
and acclamation.
Nor am I talking
about the exceptional,


the fearful, the dreadful,
the very extravagant--
but of the ordinary,
the common, the very drab


the daily presentations.
Oh, good scholar,
I say to myself,
how can you help


but grow wise
with such teachings
as these--
the untrimmable light


of the world,
the ocean's shine,
the prayers that are made
out of grass?

During the last mountain pose, I heard in my head Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz saying, ""There's no place like home."" Then I realized how appropriate for this 30 day Home practice that my husband, daughter and I began the new year by starting to watch Wizard of Oz 19 1/2 minutes before midnight so that when Dorothy opens to the door to her house that has just landed in Oz and the film transitions from black and white to color would happen just as the new year/new decade began.

And from an emotional standpoint, I love that I can laugh and cry through the course of almost every one of these videos. 
I can't remember right now what it was that made me laugh... But it was ""like you love yourself"" made me cry.  That's what this season is for me... Acting like I love myself.

Then there are the times I get in bed late, I have to get the car to the mechanic at 7am, my cat wakes me up three times in a night.... you know how it goes. That's when I go to Plan B yoga. The window of time that works for me is 4-5 in the afternoon after I finish work but before I have to start dinner. I don't schedule any appointments during this time and I arrange my schedule to have that time open. If I missed am yoga, I have this backup plan. Bonus for me is that if I have done my morning yoga, I gain this nice space to read, garden, craft, call a friend, or (let's be honest) troubleshoot some daily crisis, which is a great motivator to do morning yoga! Wishing you all the benefits of regular practice. Love from NC USA.",Ugx6DOfONtOLCO6x28F4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-05T14:09:58Z,0.9914368987083435

1929.0,"Day 4/30 
Activate - It's almost 5am here in Texas, and I just noticed something about my body. Before I say what I've noticed, I should mention something else. I'm 23 years young and I have Fibromyalgia. When I was 14 years old, I started getting sick not knowing. Experiencing so much pain and being completely clueless to what was going on. I didn't get diagnosed until I was about 20 years young. That being said, this morning, I woke up and noticed my posture. I usually have this bump in my neck (fwd neck). I've had it for a very long time, but it's less noticeable now. I feel taller, like my crown is lifting higher. Less collapsing on my chest and ribs. 
I know it's because of Yoga with Adriene. I will continue my journey with you all because I want to see how my body will continue to reform itself throughout this ""challenge"". 
Thank you, Adriene and fellow yogis.
