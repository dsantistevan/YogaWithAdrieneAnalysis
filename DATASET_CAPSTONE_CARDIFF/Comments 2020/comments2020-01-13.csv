103.0,"Hello from the future-past. I am participating in the November 2020 Root to Rise monthly challenge and today is Day 13, where I'm supposed to be doing a 45m yoga practice. Just not feeling that today, so I decided to take a peek at my other options and landed on this day 13 of another challenge. 

This is an excellent practice. Gentle and tough at the same time, I really loved doing that practice and the way that I feel right now after doing it. 

Definitely want to echo the comment Adriene made about how quickly things can evolve. I'm not even two weeks in (boy, how long some months seem to take in this year) and I genuinely feel stronger, in everyday life and in my yoga practice sessions. 

I'm pretty sure I've been acknowledging this in my comments thus far, but if not, I just want to reiterate (it can't be said enough, honestly) how beautiful Adriene's technique as an instructor is. She pushes you to your limit while acknowledging and encouraging you to embrace your own current position, no matter where that is. I wish we could distill that element and give it directly to every teacher in the world.

I finally understand why this position was a challenge for me, and now I'm doing a super easy very of the boat pose which doesn't strain my hip flexors as much...

I have been casually doing yoga for a number of years now, but never have I taken the time or had someone guide me through the basic practices such as starting movements from the core. I know I should be doing these in theory but haven't been committed enough to teach myself. This program so far has been wonderful to establish these practices and I've been actively working on it even in my movements off the mat. Today when we were going through the motions and you reminded us to claw through the fingers and engage through the pelvic floor, I found in some cases I was already doing it, which to me is a breakthrough.

Just wanted to express my gratitude.  Especially through the COVID-19 time, most of my time is spent around my girlfriend's family.  We left our home in New Orleans to come to a safer space as cases in Louisiana spread like wildfire.  As wonderful as her family is, my time spent with you has helped me find peace in all of this commotion.  I am also soon approaching 3 weeks of sobriety and I feel that this has and will continue to help me maintain that longevity.


Also, thank you for your humor.  You're pretty feakin' dope all around.

440.0,"Hi, Adriene! 
Let me begin by offering my sincerest thanks to you for creating this incredible at home yoga journey. I was diagnosed with a pretty nasty case of Lyme disease a couple of years ago and have been struggling ever since to find a form of exercise that my body could handle. Do you have any tips for people trying to do yoga while struggling with Lyme? Joint pain is one of my worst symptoms, so any type of repetitive motion is difficult for me. I had tried many yoga classes, but none did a good job of addressing modifications and ways to be kind to your body. Thank you for making this such a big part of your practice! The 30 Day Home practice is my favorite so far, as is the Wind Down practice. You are doing truly incredible work and I am sure I am not alone in offering my gratitude. I did have a couple of questions for you: 

-I have noticed my right shoulder is a bit sore, and I notice it the most when I get into down dog. Do you think it is an overextension problem? Do you hear people having similar trouble? I don't want to push it, but I am guessing it's just a matter of building the shoulder strength? 
-Do you have any recommendations for long legs? I'm finding that whenever I get into my low lunge and I am bracing my knee in the  crook of my armpit that I cannot fully plant my hands on the ground. I have long legs, so I am guessing there is no fix for this problem, unless you think I am doing the pose incorrectly? 

Thank you for everything, Adriene. Truly. Such an inspiration!

Thus, in celebration, I did some research and decided to get my very first private lesson in a studio close but far enough for a couple of days get away with my lover.  Though I’m looking forward to this, I feel like I’m cheating on you Adriene. I want a private lesson with you!lol.  However, I’ve practiced a couple of times with other you tubers but they shore ain’t my little Texan lady! I only did that because you make fun of yourself, when you go into your roots! It’s not so different from my own rural Southeast Missouri upbringing.  Matter of fact a native Floridian has a very distinct dialect, as well.  Anyway, I will always follow you, my lady. I don’t think I’ve mentioned it, but I’ve only missed a yoga practice when I’m injured, two days in a row , at most. I’m on day 14 of home.  I’m repeating the whole month and loving it!

526.0,"""Space to grow."" I've been scared of some space that I'll soon be getting. I've been fearful of it, of what that space means, of what it could mean, and of what it will feel like (both good and bad). I'm shaky, nervous, anxious.... fighting this overwhelming sensation of bugs crawling up my back to sit on my shoulders. With all of these negative feelings and emotions toward this space, I never thought of it as ""space to grow."" Thank you for that cue. I'm going to work to flip my perspective a d see this as a space to grow, to fill, the ability to fill it instead of seeing myself in my dark little corner of my world and the space being full of monstrosities that will crush me without someone else to keep them at bay.

Good morning FWFG,

I'm only reaching out to you because I'm pretty sure yoga is allowing me to predict, and I use any of this loosely, the future.

It feels so strong in my head, but when I try to talk to the people in my life I get the most bazaar reactions.

I feel like nobody can hear me now. Like I'm in another world or demotion.

There's times when it gets overwhelming.

There's times when I'm working on a project and a wave of emotions engulf me and I know that I shouldn't move forward with the project, or there's a hidden mistake.

I work for people, so it's not like I can tell them that we shouldn't bid the building, because I have an overwhelming feeling of dread or mental pain.

I see things in my environment that I relate directly to the thought running in my brain, or here myself say something out loud for no reason that resistance with what the tone of my thought stream was.

There's times where it scares me and I wonder why it's happening to me. I also know I'm not the only one.

I've had people come through my life that seemed like they could help me through, but it never felt like they were. They could only help me to understand what it was, and I'm grateful for that.

I'm just trying to figure out a way to make it feel less aggressive. I understand surrender to an extent, and I'm sure I have more to learn. 

I'm pretty sure where the discomfort comes from is a control issue. I'm used to running the show.

I guess all I'm trying to do is share with someone who I feel actually believes me, and I don't really have that. Well at least it doesn't feel that way.

Really from the bottom of my heart I'm grateful for you and your people and all that you-all's do. 

Sincerely yours,

Eric wade",UgxnbMh0xjPH6r672nJ4AaABAg,3.0,0.0,2020-01-17T02:40:04Z,-0.9875150918960571

I started a daily yoga practice in June 2019. Before that I was completely sedentary, out of shape, weak, feeling awful all the time.

Yoga gave me a chance to dedicate myself to moving my body for the first time in my life. And now, only 6 months later, the improvements are dramatic. I’m more toned, lifted, and muscular, but the spiritual and mental benefits matter even more than physical results. Adriene is one of the first instructors I discovered on my journey. she really got me feeling enthusiastic and comforted with any doubts or insecurities I had as a beginner. 

If the boat pose at the end killed you, don’t worry - practice as much as you can and soon, you’ll have enough core strength to tackle it!!

663.0,"Good morning friends! 🙏 As yoga is helping me continue to get stronger, I've been more proactive in my personal life and getting busier...which means I have to be even more mindful of what I do with my time. Whenever I take on too many things, I notice that I crash and burn, and often it's because I end up making certain things less of a priority (not consciously); I literally have to write down and start scheduling things that I normally just did because I had time--I now have to consciously makentime--oherwise I end up getting swept up into the arms of adventure. Haha. Fortunately, I've been taking time to solidify the roots of my daily yoga practice, and at worst, I'll miss a day of practice that I make up the following day. A quote from Stephen Covey that often came to mind this week is the following: 

""The most important thing is to keep the most important thing the most important thing."" 

It's easy to love something if that's the only thing in your life...but that seems passive. I feel that love is active: that if you choose something despite many other things in your life that may also interest you or pull your attention, you pick it every time. And I always will choose you 🙏💜🕉️ Namaste.",Ugy3-9t-DXTgVlFl7TB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-15T16:53:39Z,-0.6209537386894226

900.0,"HELLO! back at it - with it being this little freewriting practice I've cultivated alongside this YWA journey. the last comment I wrote was for ""Inquire"" - I'm glad to find myself back here for this practice, since Adriene's words in the description suggest that Inquire -> Growth represented a mini-arc within this 30-day journey. be curious as to what's happening within you; ground yourself in your own truth/reality; dig deeper to expand yourself; be kind by nurturing yourself along the way; and grow! 

I feel like I've had some mini-breakthroughs in the past couple days, and I've been sitting here for a bit, trying to wrangle it all together - but I find myself wrung-out-and-content, in that sort of way, after you've done good things for yourself (exercised, showered, cooked) after a weekend of, hmm, less than optimal choices - so instead, I'm just going to let it be and enjoy this moment and this feeling. may everyone here, by shining the light of consciousness within, grow -- and like sunshine on a plant, may that growth bud without force or maneuvering.

I just want to take a moment to thank you. On day 13 this journey already has changed my life so much. I did the practice this morning and yet now, during the day I keep wondering if I can still do the practice today. I look forward to it so much and if I do in the morning, I feel sad I already did it. On the other hand, I just love doing it in the morning because it‘s sets the tone for my day perfectly. I have been so much more relaxed and calm during the day and I can feel that I‘m getting stronger. I work a job where I have to be standing all day and normally I would get bad back pain in the evening but now I don‘t any more. Thank you so much, I will definitly keep this up and I‘m planning to do all your other 30 day challenges as well.

 I myself, am Christian.
I have been practicing yoga on and off for about a year.
however lately I've been questioning if it's roots would affect my faith, even if i'm practicing with prayer and God on my mind, is it still against God's word against doing everything with the intent of strenghtening your relationship with God and the Lord??
i can't seem to shake the feeling that it's worshipping something against my beliefs and i've found more arguments against it rather than for it, however that may be due to keywords in my google searches.
