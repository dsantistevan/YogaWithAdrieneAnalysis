May you be open to receiving the love and heartfelt admiration I send to you. 
It is truly my greatest honor and pleasure to have the opportunity to ask questions, create opportunity, and to guide this yoga practice.
Thank you. Thank you for saying yes. 


Your willingness, your commitment, and follow through serves as such an inspiration for me.

16.0,"This is the first time I've actually completed the 30 day yoga journey with Adriene. Last year I left an abusive relationship and have been healing since then. I used to do yoga when I was younger but stopped doing it after entering into the (at the time unknown) abusive relationship. With lots of support and savings, I decided to take a year off of working to work on my physical and mental health. I started late, but figured I'd do the 30 days of yoga. I just finished it and I cried so hard at the end. I'm so proud of myself for getting up every day and doing it no matter my energy level, and today leading myself while doing it beside everyone else (spiritually) just felt so good. There were times I wasn't sure what to do next so I pulled back in and focused on my breathing while I went back to a neutral stance like mountain or downdog or laying down. I'm not really sure entirely why I got so emotional at the end, but I think I just got so overwhelmed with positive feelings and I tend to cry when I get overwhelmed, even with good things.

That was long, but I just wanted to say thank you so much Adrien and everyone participating in this whenever. It really does help a lot and I feel much better than I did a month ago. I'm looking forward to MOVE in January 2022.",UgzVdfc83UMp3R8uz5B4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-12-15T07:25:34Z,0.9977207779884338

And today, now, I've just finished without skipping a day! It was an amazing 30-day journey that helped me not only physically but also mentally. I really enjoyed each day and your lead, adored the moments with Benji, laughed at your precious humour. And this last video embodied all the vocabulary I've learned, I remembered all the positions from each day - those are beautiful memories. When the final song began to play, I cried, I was moved. Excellent work, huge impact for me, blessings to you, Bengi and all the community which was supportive as well.

44.0,"I feel like writing this down. Last year was hard for me. Towards the end of 2020, a friend of mine recommended I do these 30 days yoga programs. At first, I was reluctant and it wasn't working all that well...But i kept on coming to these videos. First thing I noticed, I was breathing better. I took the time to breath in and out during yoga and it translated into my life.

Then came endurance,  I had a rough time finishing 20 minute videos, but I kept on doing them. 

January was so fun this year! I was in the middle of Yoga Camp when I noticed Breath was happening live! I stopped Yoga Camp and started the journey live with you guys and the feeling was very positive for me.

Now, almost a year later, I'm still breathing well, exercising a lot more (running, push ups etc etc). Yoga had such a huge impact for me and I am so grateful for my friend to tell me this existed. Same goes for you Adriene and the yoga community. 

And today I cried a bit. finishing the 30 day journey was both a great learning experience and knowing ' this was the end ' has hits my feelings. But it's all for the better. I have better tools to deal with whatever may come my way.

You guys are awesome and if you're struggling, keep coming to the videos, I wholeheartedly believe you can do it !

Here we are, here YOU are. Day 30. I just completed all 30 days of this journey and reflecting back it wasn't always easy to get to the mat and click play on the video. but i made it, and here i am, with a body thats more flexible and energetic than when i first started, and a yoga vocabulary that is more full and vibrant than when i first began. reflecting back on this I gave myself a hug and said I am proud of you Corey :) 

it is important to give ourselves moments of appreciation and just pure gratitude. I invite you to take a moment and thank yourself. reflect upon who you once were and how you have grown through the process and although at times it gets painful and scary, you always pull through. you deserve a moment of appreciation, from my heart to yours,

you are loved, you are appreciated.

237.0,"This is my 30th day in yoga, so it‚Äôs been a month since I first started. I decided to do yoga because I figured it‚Äôs not too much for my body to handle unlike workouts. At first, I was hesitant in certain shapes or if I should do this before that, but somehow, Adrienne‚Äôs voice just echoes in my head, tells me what to do and encourages me to keep going. After the session, I cried when I saw the quote at the end. At first, I didn‚Äôt know why I cried, but when I reread the quote, it really struck me. For this year, I really do strive for growth, for a better me, for a healthier mentality. As I cried, I kept muttering to myself, ‚ÄúI finished the 30 days‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of myself‚Äù. Actually as I write this, I‚Äôm still crying T_T I easily give up on certain things when I know that I can‚Äôt keep up, but completing 30 days was a huge accomplishment for me today. Thank you so much Adrienne for being there and knowing that I‚Äôm not alone with my struggles.

Background: i didn't like yoga at first because i'm the hardcore type and was a cheerleader/athelete a few years back. I tried yoga from free gym classes but i just didnt get it. But because of the pandemic i needed a mindful exercise to holistically lead me into the right mentality; and thankfully i found Adriene's channel. It's so beginner friendly and she's not just about the trend.. she made me appreciate the ESSENCE of Yoga and not the face value of being a ""yogi"". I get it. Thanks to you, Adriene.  This 30 day video made me almost cry; i could tell by your stares that u were ""proud of me"" like u were actually talking to me. does that make sense.

The reason I started yoga was that I wanted to fix some muscle tightness/pains from working out and not stretching correctly for the major part of my gym career. I didn't expect there would be such a healthy mental improvement from doing yoga as well. The deep breathing, mindful movements, and really just Adriene's positive dialogue throughout the 30 days have really helped my mindset and way of thinking. Anyways, looking forward to more yoga, more growth, and getting a lot more use out of the yoga mat my sister got me for Christmas!

Adriene you are a fantastic human being. I am so grateful to have found  you. Making yoga a daily practice for me is now so much more a reality after working through these 30 days.

Today was the last day, and it‚Äôs almost as if I was always meant to end this year with this series. About 10 min in, the weight of this year and the gratitude for making it through this year all hit me, and I just sat on my mat and started bawling. I said all the things I was grateful for, set new year intentions, and sent love & light to everyone that suffered this year.

361.0,"Tonight is Christmas Eve, and a hard one for me. For all of us on a collective level, but for me on a personal level entirely separately. So there's a lot. I almost didn't show up today. I wanted to do one of your old practices instead. I thought I had to wait until I was strong enough. I felt frustrated, because your guidance has been one of the only things I have been able to truly trust, to count on, and not feel so alone, because someone is there to catch me. But I showed up today, with all my anxiety and grief, I showed up. Something told me to show up, I heard it above my uncertainty and fear. I showed up. Feeling alone on Christmas Eve in a pandemic, where nothing looks the same. Not even yoga looked the same today. But here's the message that I found, or that found me. ""Even when things look different, the good parts are just the same."". Love will always catch my fall. Love will always show up. It could never be absent. It is everything. So in a period of transition and grief, that's what I can count on. And so between fearful thoughts, I began to embrace ""different"". I began to praise ""different"". And see it as a blessing. As my Rebirth. No, this doesn't feel the same. And it is because of the beautiful healing journey I've been on. But the Love is still here just the same. So I'm letting go. Letting go of what I thought it was supposed to look like. Because here was a surprise, something totally new. And it was a beautiful one. Home is inside of me. So I can never be lost. Support and guidance and Love are right here. In me. Home. 

Namaste, Adriene. Namaste to anyone who may read this. This practice made me cry. And the quote at the end was exactly what I needed right now. Here I am. Beginning again. After my trauma. Here I am. Reborn. Home.

362.0,"Can't believe I did it! Can't believe how excited I am for the new 30-day series coming in 2021! I was never able to commit to daily yoga in the past, but I got an apartment on my own a few months back, and being alone so often made me realize how much I needed something like this as a way of taking care of / checking in with myself.

I was really nervous for this last video since there are no verbal cues. It was definitely challenging, but it also resulted in some really cool moments. Like many others have said in comments, I kept hearing Adriene's voice in my head. When we did star pose, I heard ""take up space"" and I smiled and started to tear up. The realization that I am HERE and I am ALIVE just hit me so strongly. And then when we were in plank pose and did the thing where we touch our hips to the ground, I remembered to whisper to myself, ""I am strong.""

I just want to say thanks to Adriene and thanks to all of you! It's amazing that, even though we're all in different places, we are all on this yoga journey together. Namaste.",UgxndJFa_Ungl8V7w-x4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-12-24T14:15:37Z,0.9996483325958252

also many times to myself I was saying things like...
Lots of love in, lots of love out. do what feels right. lost warrior pose, and many more.
when I layed down and after one more deep breath, I put my thumbs to my third eye and said out loud Namaste.

A friend recommended your channel to me during the first lock-down and I started doing your ""30 days of yoga"" in May. Since then - as of today - I completed all of your 30 day challenges and I'm so glad and grateful that I did, because it has helped me so much to stabilize physically and mentally. Doing yoga has become an essential morning routine for me!
Although the 30th day was always a challenge for me and still is in some way, today was the first time I didn't think ""What am I going to do next?"" the whole time. So thank you, for giving me the tools, for teaching me so much about caring for my inner self and for providing all this amazing, free yoga content.

Ive never left a comment but always look forward to what you are going to bring to the table. Recently I did 29 days of the home journey and I loved every part of it. Through the home journey I found a new appreciation for commitment that‚Äôs rooted in flexibility. Today I went to finish the last day and after a few minutes of having to look up and try to figure out where I lost track of what the next move was I just decided to replace the practice with something that I could hear. For me it‚Äôs hard to really get into all of the things that make a home practice juicy when I can‚Äôt tell where each posture will lead. Once we started in downward dog I couldn‚Äôt turn my neck to properly see you and it didn‚Äôt feel good. I want you to know that I really appreciate the way that you lead people with your voice. Your classes are detail oriented and I really can just zen out and know how to articulate my body to work toward what feels good. I‚Äôm sure that some people really loved getting the opportunity during class to speculate and find what feels good for them, but I felt mostly distracted and I just felt like maybe I could offer you that perspective.

Committed to this new challenge for myself. Thank you Adrienne, I could hear your voice in my head in every pose. It was very satisfying to peek to take you as reference and find myself in the exact same pose, regardless of the JOURNEY that brought us to that specific one.

And I gonna continue to do so. Thank you so much for showing us the path, guiding us, grounding us, not just with your videos, but with your little and calm voice in our heads even off the mat. I have become so much better and calmer, especially when dealing with difficult situations and people, I have become less fearful and actually giving life a chance, instead of closing myself up and hiding behind.

I came back to it and powered through, but I didn't enjoy it. The quote at the end was a bit of salt in the wound, because this last session has completely destabilized me and made me question whether I want to continute doing yoga. I discovered Adriene's channel because of pain I was having in my neck and shoulders.

412.0,"I pushed off doing this very last practice for months after finishing the other 29 days of Home. I knew I wanted to finish the 30 days at some point, but the idea of a self-guided 40 minute practice was incredibly daunting and so I kept choosing guided practices in favor of finishing the challenge. Maybe it was the Holiday spirit, but I finally did this practice and am so grateful for it. Thank you Adriene, despite having never met me in person, for giving me the tools and vocabulary to guide myself through a yoga practice - so much so that sometimes I would take a peek at the screen after doing my own thing and we were in the same move! Whenever I would lose focus or flow, I could remind myself that I could just meet you in downward dog and the 40 minutes felt much less intimidating.

I cried out of frustration or out of happiness on some days, sweated on others and meditated when I needed it the most. I learned to be kind to myself and listen to my body. This day was harder because I had more freedom with my movements which was both scary and exciting at the same time, but I loved knowing I could watch you whenever I felt like I needed help.

In this session today I also had moved through different emotions as someone else mentioned and I had a real A-HA moment when in boat pose... For years I lacked the strength and confidence to do it properly, as I could never do it without intense cramping in my hip flexors or without putting pressure on my sciatic nerve. I believed I was a lost cause because it was always so uncomfortable/painful, I just thought ""it's not for me""... But with this daily practice, I am now able to do a modified version with much less discomfort in my hip flexors. I can't do it ""perfectly"" but I'm okay with knowing that I'm making progress and it feels amazing. ‚ô•Ô∏é I feel so much stronger than 30 days ago.

The recovery was and still is ongoing, very long. I found myself so tense and clenched up from pain and anger that I decided I needed help with some stretching.

450.0,"It's been 8 months now since I heard that my job was shutting down and I would be laid off due to the pandemic and subsequent lockdown. I can still taste the fear and anxiety that took over in the wake of such uncertainty, but then also the sense of resolution and surrender that had to follow in its wake. It is in those feelings that I received a message from a friend who I'd lost touch with over time. It was an invitation to do 30 Days of Yoga, the first 30 day journey that this channel embarked on. In the interest of staying grounded and creating stronger routines to manage my mental health, I accepted my friend's invitation.
     At first I told myself, ""Just finish one solid week."" At the end of that week I felt more confident, and so I told myself to just finish one more week. After that it was smooth sailing to the end of that first series, and I cannot tell you how proud and accomplished I felt at the end of that time. I'm someone that struggles with consistent routine, and discipline has always been a weak point. When the idea first came into my mind that I might continue on and try to complete every available 30 day journey in sequence, I dismissed it immediately. ""I could never"" ""I'll give up"" ""I'll surely fail along the way""
     What slowly disintegrated those thoughts was the love for, and patience with my body that I'd been cultivating over those first 30 days... and so I continued on. I told myself, ""just one more sequence"", ""just one more day"". I created a journal to slowly check off each practice as I completed it, and over time something changed. 30 Days of Yoga, Yoga Camp, Revolution, True, Dedicate, and finally Home... This has been such a profound and beautiful journey, and I've uncovered so much on my way inward. It's a blessing to have observed Adriene grow and blossom into such an amazing teacher and friend, to see and experience the maturity and wisdom settle into her body and spirit... And it's a blessing that this same maturity and wisdom has taken root in me too.
     In this time I've revealed to myself a sense of self-belief. I've learned to trust in myself and my intuition. I've seen how diligent, disciplined, and honest I can be. I've laughed, and cried, and screamed... I've become more patient, kinder to my body, and awakened more love and gratitude for it. I've demonstrated to myself that I can achieve anything simply by taking one step. So much has changed over these months and the landscape of the world around us looks so very different. That same sense of resolution and surrender that first drew me to you all that time ago is still necessary, still vital... But I am capable and strong. Thank you for the beautiful gift of your time and friendship. Thank you for holding space with me on my mat, and for being there in a time when so many of us needed you most. The YWA Team and community is such a truly profound and meaningful thing.
     Moving forward I'm going to continue on a special journey of my own making. I've patiently marked all of my favorite practices over the last 8 months.

Well, here I am, 30 days later, and I have so much more energy, a clearer mind and a stronger body.

I did lots of different kinds of exercises and i pushed myself above my limits, hurted myself in the process. And turns out yoga was exactly what i was needed! Adriene's little comments in the videos such as ''dont worry if u cant go all the way, if u cant do this its totally fine'' really helped me. Even though i cant quite do the poses i felt like i've accomplished something. I started to laugh at my mistakes. When i felt that i couldnt practise that day, i didnt felt like i was disappointing myself. Yoga's relative slow flow made me more aware of my body and  how i did the poses started to matter to me.

564.0,"In out-of-the-way places of the heart,
Where your thoughts never think to wander,
This beginning has been quietly forming,
Waiting until you were ready to emerge.

For a long time it has watched your desire,
Feeling the emptiness growing inside you,
Noticing how you willed yourself on,
Still unable to leave what you had outgrown.

It watched you play with the seduction of safety
And the gray promises that sameness whispered,
Heard the waves of turmoil rise and relent,
Wondered would you always live like this.

Then the delight, when your courage kindled,
And out you stepped onto new ground,
Your eyes young again with energy and dream,
A path of plenitude opening before you.

Though your destination is not yet clear
You can trust the promise of this opening;
Unfurl yourself into the grace of beginning
That is at one with your life's desire.

Awaken your spirit to adventure;
Hold nothing back, learn to find ease in risk;
Soon you will home in a new rhythm,
For your soul senses the world that awaits you.

626.0,"I appreciate the sentiment of an unguided yoga practice for day thirty but I left the mat feeling very anxious and frustrated to the point of ending early because I felt the need to keep craining to look at my tv every 5-10 seconds to make sure I‚Äôm on pace or doing the right positions. I assume from other comments people were able to memorize the flow but I wasn‚Äôt there. I felt compelled to either keep looking incessantly to keep up with the video or do something completely based off intuition which didn‚Äôt feel like the right thing to do either.

Really lost connection with that practice throughout my 20s. Partied hard and accidentally didn't do any yoga for about 8 years. Foolishly in my mind I thought I would pick back up where I left off when I was 18 (NOPE). It feels so good to come back to practice. I am so glad I did this, and really want to incorporate yoga into my daily routine again. Thank you Adriene!

637.0,"I loved the concept!  You have taught us, worked with us, and we have worked with you for 30 sessions.  It was time for us to try our wings.  It's amazing how clearly I see my behaviors, attitudes and approaches off the mat come to the mat.  I recall Adriene saying this from time to time in these 30 sessions.  I panicked a little when she said she was going without a mic.  I mostly trust her now, but not myself.  At first, I occasionally looked to see what she was doing & followed. I did my own thing, like the side plank  and listened to my body, but somewhere along the way I started trying to keep up with her completely.  The half and full forward folds and rises have come to mean surrender & opening myself to my Higher Power's strength etc.  Those were very personal beautiful moments.  I love to read what Adriene writes below the video.  It's often said in the video.  I sometimes cry because I'm getting in touch with myself again.  I'm returning to myself.  There were a lot of messages in the 30th day for me to process.  I'm super grateful for the gifts I have received from my HIGHER POWER, through YOGA & through ADRIENE's HOME series.  I too heard her voice throughout!  I hear it off the mat too!  hahaha!  I appreciate the comments made by the community below.  I can always relate somehow to each of you.  I'm new here, but look forward to getting to know people and make friends!  Sorry for journaling in the comment section!  I'll work on that. I'm talkative & have been isolated since March!

639.0,"Hi there Adriene! This is my story: When I first started your yoga program I was recovering from covid-19. I was not ill anymore, but for maybe three months my immune system had been very vunerable, I got new colds and other types of infections all the time, and I was so tired that a doctor took me off work part time. My working memory was failing, I had a hard time dealing with new or complex information. In the beginning I could only do yoga every second day, because the exercise drained my energy enough for the exhaution to ""spill over"" to the next day. My arms and legs were shaking in easy positions like Standing dog. But I persisted, and after a week or so I could see the difference and started to feel a little more like myself again. For different reasons (like I had to go slow in the beginning, and some days I would join people in yoga who did another one of your programs) the program took mee almost two months to finish. But by the end of Home I felt mentally and physically recovered. This became a long post, but what I really want to do is to send a big THANK YOU all the way from Malm√∂, Sweden. All the best / K√§bi",Ugxaf5gmggPoo1zrTnd4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2020-09-07T05:54:42Z,-0.995107889175415
640.0,"Dear Adriene, another 30 days journey, wonderful. The last video is without words. A bit nervous at the beginning, but it all turned out fine. I just knew how to breath, when to joke. And the cute Bengi, omg. 
Always put my laptop on my right side. So it seems you lying down beside me, like a mirror. I peak you from time to time, and even my eyes closed, I see you smiling. You are my guide, also my dearest companion. When I found you share the same ponytail as me today, I felt great joy. Haha. 
Through this journey, I'm trying to figure out what home means to me. Hometown? Dormitory? I found it at the end, the real home is my own body. Every time I looked down on my feet and touched my sweat on my back, I was amused by my body. ""It's a very beautiful body, how can I never feel that way before?""
There's a Chinese poem: ""Ê≠§ÂøÉÂÆâÂ§ÑÔºå‰æøÊòØÂêæ‰π°"", means ‚Äúwherever I find peace, that is my home.""

659.0,"I will be honest. There were meny moments I couldn't focus or commit this time. I got a scatter brain and I couldn't stick with you or listened to your voice or more importantly my own voice/heart sometimes. In fact this was my second time doing your 30days yoga journey and I did your very first 30 days yoga practice 5-6 years ago. Back then I had such a mindblowing and wonderful experience. So I was a bit disappointed at myself this time. But no matter how hard it was or how poorly I practiced,  at least I made a decision to never stop and always come back on the mat. Here I was on the 30th day, I knew what was coming - a freestyle yoga. This time I wasn't expecting much. I even had doubts about mylsef if I could do by myself. When you put your microphone down and the nice gentle music started, I reluctantly closed my eyes, sat legs crossed, breathed deeply, then the magic happened. I could *finally* shut down my brain, listen to my breath and my body, then I could finally let go and reconnect my heart. I lost in the beautifu music and followed the rhythm of my breath. I realized the goal and purpose of this practice wasn't to be perfect, but to listen to yourself, which means reconnect your heart -HOME. I did find a way HOME in the end.  Toward the end of the practice, I got emotional like many of you. It's always a beautiful feeling. When I finished up my practice, I sat leg crossed, closed my eyes and breathed gently again. Then I slowly opened my eyes.  My dog was standing right in front of me giving me the best smile while holding her favorite toy. Then she jumped on my lap as if she was waiting for that moment.

Mostly because I have to set my computer up off to the side in my space so I can't see it easily during the practice. In the beginning I was glancing over to the screen every few seconds and my brain was all over trying to figure out what was next. This sucked as normally I'm calm, my brain is shut off besides following the cues. This would have been easier for me if Adriene just said a loose guideline for what to do and where to go and than just sat there smiling. At one point I decided to just breathe and do what I wanted but then found myself still glancing at the screen and switching directions to follow. Finally my solution was to watch her go through the poses and very slowly follow. That way I didn't have to think about as much. By the time we got to the floor I couldn't see the screen at all so just did what I wanted and closed out.

689.0,"Dear Adriene.

I really do hope you read this.  Today marked the end of my HOME journey and as someone who completed your 30 Day Yoga challenge a couple months ago the humbling realisation, that the last day may be another freestyle type Yoga session, all flooded back to me.  The passing of the baton, passing of the torch and gift of total trust was given to me once again today.  Despite having the thought in the back of my mind that ""oh this gonna be another freeestyle video,"" the wave of sadness and gratitude was still overwhelming.  I always get too used to and too comfortable with having you there to guide me, that I feel sad when it's time to say goodbye.

But this time I make a promise to make sure this isn't a goodbye.  It's simply a 'see you next time.'  Because this time round you aided me to find a deeper love, appreciation and serenity that I thought I had found during the last Yoga journey.  Am I still going to miss the idea of it being a 30 day journey/challenge?  Absolutely.  However, this time the ending feels different.  I don't feel like a complete novice anymore.  I feel more complete.  And I feel like Yoga is not just a challenge or goal for me to reach.  You have helped make Yoga my lifestyle:)

I did this challenge alongside the Insanity workout and I am on day 30 of 63 for that workout as I type this comment.  This challenge has helped my cardio performance so much that I wish I could thank you eternally.  Since I do have another 30 days left of Insanity, I very may well just restart this HOME workout since I have a hard time letting people go haha.  Or I may do other random forms of Yoga per day until I reach the end.  But the bottomline is - I can't go.  I appreciate you too greatly!  And now I love Yoga too much.

Thank you and see you next time!",UgwPebiZJj3HPkMjDFd4AaABAg,1.0,42.0,2020-08-25T13:49:40Z,0.9896453619003296

Which means I can do whatever I want. Find what feels good. So I put together a yoga practice that fit my current needs - mostly restorative and focused on stretching aching muscles. I glanced up at Adriene every now and then to see what she was doing, but I was perfectly happy doing my own thing. I was really surprised by this, because during previous day 30s I always tried to keep up with Adriene. And now I just...didn't. It was really empowering to realise I had all the tools to put together a 40 min sequence by myself, for myself.

That said, I still prefer being guided by Adriene :D",UgwNmElTpC7KPq_987N4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2020-08-02T14:35:33Z,0.9972789883613586

I was a little nervous about ""Silent Adriene"" mostly because I've done most all of this whole practice by letting her voice guide me (especially the times when she says go ahead and close your eyes if you want to and I already had).  But I was able to do it today -- maybe not perfectly or at the very same pace -- but I did it and enjoyed the journey and new experience!  I was worried about missing all of he wisdom that she imparts along the way -- kind of in passing -- that I've learned from but I heard many of those messages repeated in my head as I went along today; both of how to do the yoga poses and move as well as  how to take it into daily life.  I must say that I loved the music!!!  And it was like watching poetry in motion to see Adriene move so beautifully through the poses. 
This was a great yoga experience and I recommend it to anyone and everyone! I'm going to do ""Home"" again after I try some of Adriene's other series.",UgxJblo8D4ZGvIydTpB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-07-31T17:06:33Z,0.9996265172958374

This made me a bit emotional to be honest. Before Adrienne I was very skeptical of Yoga.  It was a very lovely and welcome coincidence (or maybe not), that on the last day of the 30 days of Yoga just before I was about to start, I got a call from work and I got a promotion!

During quarantine, I knew I had to start embracing a healthier lifestyle. I started doing HIIT and (eventually) yoga every other day after being recommended your channel. I started with the Home series cuz I thought it was created by the need to quarantine, but it was just a fantastic coincidence! I‚Äôve never done yoga before and decided to try it. Here I am, 2 months later and I just completed a self-led practice with the tools and grace you gave us during the Home journey. Like many others, I was intimidated by the 40 minute video length, and learned the hard way that day 30 wouldn‚Äôt be guided. I didn‚Äôt think I could do it, but I just started by sitting in a comfy position and leaning into the breath. Then everything just.. happened. 20 minutes went by of listening to my body and moving into whatever positions I could either remember or felt like doing. I feel so much happier with myself, with my progress, and my physical flexibility. I didn‚Äôt expect this to stir some emotions in me after completing the Home journey, but thank you.

However, we never really know how to handle Day 30 of any journey. While it's nice listening to the music, we all struggle with the actual yoga sequence, getting cricks in our necks trying to see the screen while in downward facing dog, lying on our backs, etc. We all feel like we can't enjoy (and relax into) the movements because we're constantly checking what's next and how long you hold the positions for. So sadly, we've ended each series with a little more disappointment and frustration than would be anticipated.
Of course we trust ourselves and the movements we've learnt, but we don't want to make something up when we're all doing it together - just because we can't see what's actually happening.
Dear Adriene, if you ever read this comment, we would be thrilled if you would consider adding just a bit of commentary at the end of your next journey, so that the transitions from and to positions not facing the screen become more manageable.

1017.0,"So, I've been bedridden from November of past year until February of this year, crippled by full-body eczema and the depression that came with it. I'm usually fairly stable mentally (which I'm so thankful for) so the depression hit me like a freight train.

However, as I started slowly climbing out of the darkness, with the help of my incredible parents, therapist, and medication, I started to regain my sense of self.

This month, I finally decided that enough was enough - I was going to put my past behind me, whilst still holding on to the lessons and the grace that it taught me. That's when I stumbled across this 30 Day Yoga Journey.

I don't know what made me click on this particular one - after all, there were more recent Yoga Journeys - but I like to think it was serendipity, a higher power, maybe even my intuition, that brought me to you, Adrienne.

And I've done it. I've done 30 Days of Yoga, 30 days of taking care of myself for the first time in a long time  30 days of walking the path, not back to the old Ciara, but towards the new Ciara that I've always been. I've uncovered parts of my personality that I never knew were there. I'm resilient, I'm strong, and I have more optimism and hope inside me than a Disney princess (or prince, for that matter).

For the last 15mins of practice, I just lay on my side in the fetal position, with my clear skin and peaceful heart, and cried. I just cried and cried and cried. In that moment, I felt reborn.

I'm damn proud of myself for doing this, and I'm so, so thankful that you, wonderful Adrienne, have chosen to share your gift to the world.

I extend love to everyone. I extend love to myself. Most of all, I extend love to the home I've rebuilt inside of myself.

Thank you, Adrienne.
Love,

1035.0,"I am 25 years old. I want to start off by saying that this is the first goal I have ever set for myself and have willfully achieved. I started this 30 day yoga practice during quarantine, when I began deeply examining my life and reconnecting with myself spiritually, once that finally had the space for me to address it due to not working my usual, very stressful job. It also naturally created a lot of chaos, me opening up doors to myself that I had long locked shut (I've tried to commit to yoga for so long but never made the time for it). I had very little yoga experience prior to this. I definitely had no core strength or balance. I turned to yoga for mental clarity, for emotional release, and for physical health. There were hard days, but the reward that I hold now was well worth it. I haven't felt this type of mental clarity, ever. I haven't felt this good, ever. I have more patience, more grace. I am overall more calm. What I once never made time for, I now can't go a day without. I find myself excited for this practice every day, ready and willing for the internal discipline it's taught me to have. It has helped teach me, that ultimately, I am in control here. I am worthy of giving myself the time to grow. These positive changes influenced me to apply to college (my last course was 7 years ago). I am taking more initiative and chasing after my dreams. I truly owe it to these videos, this practice, and you, Adrienne. I can't wait to begin the next 30 day yoga journey tomorrow.  My new goal is to do yoga every day for a year. If I can make it 30 days, I can make it every day. I surprised myself doing the last day of this challenge. I actually was able to keep up with you and move through each pose easily. I realized I have grown a lot stronger than I thought I would grow to originally. I could go on and on about how this practice has changed my life, but alas, I'll be with you in my next journey!",UgwWs1OKVjDatM7WX-x4AaABAg,4.0,117.0,2020-06-29T22:10:36Z,0.9981167316436768

I thought about quitting and not doing this one, but then I realized how this attitude has affected my life, so I stoped second guessing and dived right in. I was so surprised that when I checked we were doing almost the same asanas, and i remembered ""intuit"" ""ground"" breathe"" ""keep"" ""lots of love in, lots of love out"" Suddenly I was flooded with this trust and confidence, it was so beautiful. I joined you for the last asanas and as soon as I finished reading the quote  my heart melted and I was crying!! Thanks to you Adriene and to this great community!

And speaking of the journey HOME, it was literally for me, since I moved in a couple month ago. And now, after finishing this yoga-journey I also feel like I have found a way into my literal new home. It does feel like home to me now.

I cry easily but during yoga I am so focused on moving and RELAXING, I thought years of joking about had made me immune to cathartic crying.

I did since second time of March more than a dozen of your practices. After this Day 30 video I felt that I need to give it a try and start the Home practice. It do not went so well, like in daily bases cause I made 2 practices/day when I did it and only about 3-5 times/week. I started doing yoga with your help as a woman who just wanna loose weight, but who do not like extreme cardio or weight lifting. I do not tell that this series of practice changed my life, but it definitely showed me a new path, where I do not have to rush it and where I can give myself one-two days to just relax. 
Practicing yoga I learned some self-acceptance and forgiveness. I learnt that when I feel that I need to take a break to actually do it and to have boundaries at college-studying and at studying.

1173.0,"Oh, Adrienne. I've been a silent lurker here since I've started doing yoga for the first time ever with this journey. But during the practise, a thousand thoughts were popping into my head, and I felt like I needed to write something afterwards.
It was magical. I truly cannot say how much yoga have changed me, physically and mentally. I've had a tumultuous period with my studies this year, and starting this practise about a month ago was a way to deal with the stress. Fitting is also how the 30th day came up with the day of my final exam, and I'm ending the whole year with a beautiful practise. :)
When I heard at the beginning that you won't speak a thing in Day 30, I was hesitant, almost as if I was a child who's getting sent to school by a mother for the first time. But it all disappeared in the first 5 minutes. The music and the flow connected me with you, and all the people practising, like never before. There's something in the silent, thoughtful, mirrored movement that serves as a wonderful communication tool, and it felt even more like coming home.
I teared up when I realized the music I've started associating with ""victory dopamine boost"" that's usually at the end of the videos is playing alongside some of the harder parts of the practise. It's so metaphorical, and so freeing, to see our hardships as something to take courage and strenght from, maybe even happiness!
I also noticed that thorough this practise I didn't complain in my head even once. Not with the boats, or the plank pushups - I simply acknowledged that they were part of the Journey, and calmly prepared myself, knowing that I can do my best, and it will be enough.

It was about mind, body, and soul. I have come to be at such peace with myself with your help; to feel loved and supported from the inside to the outside.
I've never thought I would be able to freestyle a practice of my own. But I did it, and it felt amazing and fulfilling. I took a few peeks at you and at some times we were doing the same thing. One time you smile reassured me that I was on the right path.

I have been doing yoga and teaching it for years. This is the number one hands down best yoga experience I've ever had. Adriene thank you for what you do.

I've realized that in life, ""mistakes"" are inevitable. I am always doing the best I can. I can't beat myself up to success. I can't avoid pain and bypass to success. I get to stick with myself and love ALL OF ME no matter how messy I get.

I am a Theater and Dance major, so I have a physical practice built into my days through Jazz, Ballet, Modern, movement classes and physical theater. I feel so lucky and grateful to have found this journey home. I was so desperately missing the connection with my body that I had known consistently for the past 3 years of my education. Having my routine and my physical practice suddenly taken away left me feeling confused and frustrated. I felt like a stranger in my body. Through this journey I have learned that being distracted by long days and rehearsals, dancing constantly and going to the gym to maintain my instrument is not the same thing as a loving connection with my body. Working myself to exhaustion is not the same as finding what feels good. I always struggle when Adriene asks me to surprise myself. What do I have to offer that's surprising or new? How can I do that when I'm a beginner and still learning? Well, today in this silent practice - I absolutely surprised myself. Thank you, Adriene.

I decided to lay on my back to finally get in that meditative state and eventually it felt like it was time to get up.

I'm 23 and I feel like I never really accomplished anything, I never finished anything... I've started so many things that I was super excited in the very first days and then eventually ended up giving up. I thought this yoga journey was going to be another one of those things... even though I was promising myself I was going to make it till the end, there was this part of me that was sure I was not going to finish it. But well... I made it!!!! First I was starting the videos after midnight because I was waking up really late and watching tv shows all day so after midnight was when I had time, but after day 5 or something I decided I was going to do it in the mornings so I started to wake up early just to do the yoga and then during the day I also started to do more productive things. Slowly, in these 30 days, I went from somebody who would wake up at 2 p.m, stay all day in bed eating and watching Netflix and then go to bed after 4 a.m to somebody who wakes up 8 a.m, does yoga every morning, works out in the afternoon 4 times a week, studies every day for at least 4 hours, spends time with the family and goes to bed at 22 p.m. I feel like I woke up to actually living again and I honestly believe it was all because of yoga.

This journey has done so much for me, in awareness of my body and posture, in focusing on my breathing and how important the breath is. I too struggled to get a flow without verbal cues today, but feel I got a lot from the session. It wasn't perfect, but then I have never even attended a class. (I intend to as soon as we are allowed!!) I am sure I don't get the best out of all the positions, because they need tweaking and practising, but this journey has made me realise that it will all come in good time and to go with what feels good. My intent was to find calm in myself, after a tough few months before we all got grounded. I found this process healing and enlightening and intend to continue this journey for a lot longer.
It always surprises me that when Adriene says ""I love you all"", you know and feel the truth and warmth of it. Amazing!
I wish you all peace going forward and thank you Adriene for the experience and guidance. We all love you right back!

1293.0,"Throughout much of this class, I kept thinking to myself, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this!"" I felt uncomfortable, uncertain, even scared. But it was in that discomfort that I began to notice some pretty important things. 

I have a huge fear of missing out that hinders me from being brave and doing things differently, or even asking myself what I want to do. I‚Äôm afraid of not belonging, or being on my own. I kept glancing at my screen to see what Adriene was doing so that I could follow along, losing focus of the integrity of the poses, of my breath, of staying present.

I don‚Äôt know how to follow or even feel my intuition, or maybe I just don‚Äôt trust myself enough to do so.

I‚Äôm a perfectionist, and get caught up with the minute intricacies of whether or not I am doing something right.

I‚Äôm afraid of doing things wrong, and resistant to try new things on my own.

I still don‚Äôt know how to do anything with ease and grace. Especially failure.

I struggle with truly being mindful and present.

I am very hard on myself.

My mind always feels like it‚Äôs running a hundred miles per hour, and when I am left alone with myself, the uncertainty I feel only brings in the chaotic thoughts even more persistently.

But in the silence of this class, I also found that it turns out I'm stronger than I realized I was. Doing just a little bit every day for the past thirty days has led to results that surprised me.

It was only in the last few minutes that I asked myself for the first time, ‚ÄúWhat do I want to do?‚Äù and began to diverge from what Adriene was doing. It felt terrifying, and also exhilarating, to be making my own choices and trusting myself.

I may not have liked this class at the beginning, but I sure as hell needed it. If anything, this last day taught me the ways in which I need to grow. I began to tear up when the quote from John O‚ÄôDonohue showed up at the end. 

Although I did not enjoy how I felt during much of it, today's class ended up feeling like magic when it was over. Looking back, this might be the best experience I‚Äôve had in the past thirty days.

I am so grateful, Adriene. Thank you for helping me catch my own magic. <3",UgxgV-4kFRNn4V3DPcZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-06-06T02:23:57Z,0.8168743252754211

1302.0,I am usually a silent watcher on YouTube but I have to sincerely thank you Adriene. I started this journey to try help with my PCOS and endometriosis but it's given me so much more. Today I was finally able to keep my feet flat during downward dog and I felt myself get so emotional.

1303.0,"I love adriene with all my heart and I was so happy to see benji wandering around -- and so did my dog who always watches the screen intently. I want to preface by saying I really do love everything about ywa; I tell everyone about this amazing corner of youtube like a town crier and I'm buying myself my first ever ~subscription~ to the fwfg community for my birthday this monday. My boyfriend and friends are for sure tired of me dropping yoga into every conversation so they all began practicing to appease me. Surprise! They have now joined the cult of everyday practice and are now the town criers to their own circles :)
I do feel like I failed this one though.  I knew the second I read no mic that this wasn't going to go well for me. I'm seeing themes of this in some comments too. I am a perfectionist in recovery so not 'nailing' every pose or landing on time really got to me. I was out of sync with my breath and body and really in my head. Which is beyond ironic as ywa -- specifically this home journey -- have pushed me along the path of self acceptance and confidence. This journey is nothing but remarkable and it came right on time for me but I was frustrated today. And I feel like a toddler crying from frustration simply because I didn't cry from joy or relief like the others. I'm not sure where to go from here; should I try this practice or the entire 30 days again? Did I miss the rules, should I be doing my own movements? Or should I be trying to keep up? Was I not ready? Or am I not zen or trusting enough to have finished correctly? Did I not find the right home? Because it feels as if I had my bags packed and ready to move in but I don't have the keys to the door.
Okay, I digress. This is not a bash on the ywa community or adriene herself. I have nothing but love and respect for everyone and their mats but it seems jealousy has wiggled its way in as well. I need my fellow perfectionists in the comments to know they aren't alone. Not sure I have any advice to comfort us but I definitely feel the same way. @khadija zaheer @ajmonkeyflash @Archie & Alfie @Steph anie @Kathy Moseley",UgxB8YrpSMTm3lpILiJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-06-05T11:52:01Z,-0.9742854833602905

However, I am proud that I managed to do some of it alone, remembering what we did during the series. It's gonna take more work for me to be able to do 40 minutes of yoga with no guidance but I'm ready to do that work and maybe next time, I'll be able to.

I've followed all your 30 Days series and check in with your regular videos inbetween, and each one has helped me so much. Seeing the number of your subscribers grow fills me with such hope for the world too; that so many people are discovering yoga and enriching their lives.
I teach English to international students online and share your channel with every new student I meet! The response I get is always positive and they tell me how you're helping them with their communication skills as much as their physical and mental health (I'm sure the phrase ""Hey yo!"" has a universal meaning across many cultures! :-D )

I can almost put my heels down in downward dog and I don't fall over (as much) during the warrior positions. I can do the planks without having to stop.

I remember Day 30 of 30 days of yoga, (it was about 5 years ago!?), I felt so lost not having a video to follow and it was impossible to think up things to do which was disappointing and upsetting. Now I finally relish having freedom to do what I want, this was the perfect end to Home for me.
To anyone who panicked at this - it comes eventually! You can learn the poses but I found it's a totally different ball game being able to read what your body needs that day. I hope this marks the beginning of me doing many practices alone. I think at first I'll still need this video on in the background to help me get ideas when the mind goes blank, but maybe someday I'll be able to just do it me and my mat... 
Even though I was able to think of a lovely sequence today I found it hard to be alone with my thoughts without having Adriene to listen to, which I wasn't expecting. I guess it shows I really need to work on the mindfulness and meditative side of yoga now. Excited to continue on my journey until I am a fully independent yogi!

I was determined to stay on this journey. I wanted to tell you that the last session was cathartic and really made me dig deep within. My first thought was ‚ÄúNoooo I need your voice‚Äù. Then you said ‚Äúyou already have the tools‚Äù...your encouragement and support lifted me as I cried my way through the yoga session. And I did it. Thank you because I needed to be pushed, I needed to allow myself to let the emotions flow and I needed to be reminded that what I need to survive this is within me.

1450.0,"I just paired this 30 day journey with my 30 day IVF journey. It made the meds and injections feel like a part of this amazing series. It was wonderful to wake up everyday looking fwd to the journey rather than having fear or resistance to it. I highly recommend this series for those women going through IVF. I modified toward the end, eliminated any twists and tummy time, but was able to complete all the way up to day 29 before the surgical procedure of egg retrieval. I did a modified version of day 29 and 3 hrs later I was ready for egg retrieval. I had to wait 48hrs after procedure to do any yoga so today I am happy to say I just finished day 30!
The IVF process from beginning to end was a welcomed breeze and I owe it to this series. Very grounding and perfect for this time!! Thank you Adriene. I hope we get some viable embryos but even if we don‚Äôt, I will forever remember this time fondly with an empowered and grounded feeling of home. üôèüôè Namaste everyone.

1454.0,"I am so grateful I found YWA. This journey home into my body, in the serenity of my own home, was the most beautiful gift of this quarantine. I loved your guidance, your rhythm, your levity. I have to say I loved the last day's flow and wanted to know if there was a guided version of this flow available anywhere or would you be willing to do one with guidance? 
I would love to practice this flow with guidance until I can do it with no guidance, but I think I will need another 30 days for that. I would love to make that my next yoga challenge! 
The Day 30 Home class was a little dangerous for my body because I had to keep peeking at you to follow the sequence in positions that stressed my neck and back to look. I think it would have been helpful to do the same flow fully guided on Day 29, then in silence on Day 30 so we were already familiar with what the flow was. 
I loved this experience and it has definitely turned me into a loyal YWA yogi who is finding what feels good in her body. Your dharma is a truly a gift to the world. Thank you!",UgyvE72AdG0Ue69LVdl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-05-28T16:25:40Z,0.9993190765380859

1492.0,"I rarely post more than a few words on Youtube. But this young lady is certainly worthy of incredible praise. As a middle-aged guy I never considered yoga, as I am more of a rowing guy at the gym, but in lockdown for a few months I found Adriene on Youtube and off I started on my 30 day yoga journey.

Now I must admit, I probably looked ridiculous in my living room on my exercise mat trying to crane my neck to see my tv and wondering how does this lady get into them positions with such ease. But, unperturbed, I ventured on. As I progressed I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it and by day ten I was quoting positions to myself and doing a bit of 'free-styling'. Obviously being middle-aged, I forgot to breathe correctly and was 'out' when Adriene was 'in' and so it went on. 

But all that did not matter; this quite beautiful lady, who will never know me, gracefully led me on a 30 day journey that has quite frankly been amazing. I am now a fully fledged and committed yoga starter. Now, I must add that all this was on Youtube and quite free and Adriene should be given some high praise for doing this. So much so that I will be purchasing further sessions, as the 'girl's' got to make a living right.

So before I sign off, regardless of who you are and or where you are from, if you are just passing through, I urge you to give this a go and it might just change your life.

I started doing Yoga because i was incredibly inflexible, had a bad posture which lead to having struggle with breathing while working out and playing soccer. I must say I really became so flexible I never believed I would ever become in my life and my posture has also gotten much better, but  the most important thing I've realized is that Yoga isn't just stretching. It's so much more and I'm so grateful for being able to experiencing that. I cried so much at the end of the 40 minutes, when the theme started playing and I saw your smile and then the quote. I felt so loved and not alone it's honestly incredible. During this journey I also learned how to love and respect myself, which was so hard for me just about one and a half months ago.

1664.0,"Dear Adriene, 
Thank you for creating such wonderful yoga sessions! I've been practicing for several years and have not made so much progress in such a relatively short amount of time from the guidance of your videos. I initially was attending in class yoga sessions but due to the coronavirus outbreak I turned to online sessions. I'm grateful I came across your page. After the first session I was hooked! As an intermediate yogi, I enjoyed the pace of the videos, the various modifications offered to intensify or ease the postures, and the manageable sessions for creating a daily practice. I appreciate you for emphasizing the importance of bringing the breath into the practice. I was able to go deeper in my postures which ultimately increased my endurance, strength and flexibility. What I'm most grateful for is the sense of calm I felt as soon as I pushed play and watched your videos. Thank you for sharing your cute puppy Benji in all your videos. He adds the perfect touch, is therapeutic, and promotes connection. From the bottom of my heart thank you for your dedication, efforts and sharing your gift with me and the world. With love,

At some point, though, I think I stopped looking at the screen and just flowed to the way it felt right. And before i knew it, you were done, the music went silent, and i was just about to lie down. üòÖ dunno if that was supposed to happen, but i kept going anyway, giggling all the way to the end.

By the time i finished my flow, i sat up to a seat, and lo and behold, my tears decided to chime in and started to flow on its own too. üòÖ

No words can ever express how much i appreciate your gentleness, and patience all through out. I deeply thank you for allowing me to journey back home and trust myself (unconsciously).

We always say life is to busy but now in the UK we have been in lockdown for far longer than I can remember  (more than 30 days for sure) and its hard to know how to fill the days! But when I do my yoga as I have for 30+ days I feel as though I have achieved something with my day even on and especially on days when I haven't wanted to get out of bed. Living alone and going through a break up while living in lockdown has had its ups and downs. But knowing I have this time 'on the mat' with a friendly, familiar face and Benji has really got my through. There's days where I have a cry on the mat but I always come away smiling, more centred and better able to get on with my day.

1729.0,"This was beautiful. Thank you  for this opportunity Adriene! I must admit, when you first said that we were doing our own thing today I was a little skeptical. I nervously giggled for the first three minutes (whilst acknowledging the silliness of that response). I started off with the breathing from the beginning of the Synchronize class, and then fell into the groove and just listened to my body and gave it what it needed today. It became a hip-opening restorative class as I did a 1h15m intermediate vinyasa class yesterday in addition to Day 29 andi was a hurting unit today). I never before would have allowed myself to do a practice on my own, but your gentle push into it helped me to trust myself enough to try it.

1731.0,"Whoa. I started this journey really hoping but not really believing that I could do it. I was never good at regular exercises. But this became so much more than ""exercising"". I really tried to get into this headspace, that it's more than poses and how accurately I can do them. Adriene's patient and calm instructions made it all possible even though I'm quite overweight. I learned that my body IS my home. I learned how much I'm really capable of, some of these poses never seemed possible. I came with the single intention: show yourself that you can do this, that you are persistent, reliable. And I am. If I can do this, what else can I do?
Of course it woulnd't be possible without Adriene, to whom I send my most sincere and heartfelt thanks. Your gentle instructions, unwavering faith, your soothing voice coaxing me to just TRY, your belief in me, your thanks at the end of each video - it made me a better person. And I am very grateful for that. Great, now I'm crying :)

1734.0,"I started doing random morning yoga with Adriene videos the day before we got the news that schools would be closing here in NYC due to Covid. After about 20 days of various videos that got me going and feeling good, I chose this 30 dayHome journey to keep me motivated and connected to yoga. I truly believe that yoga with Adriene has kept me centered and balanced and breathing in a way that I would not be without it during this time. I am a single mom of three young kids- 6 and almost 3 year year old twins. Their other mom is an essential worker so they don't see her as much as they used to and I don't get much of a break from being the sole caregiver, teacher, cook, housekeeper, etc. It's a lot. But I have kept yoga as a daily constant even if it meant in the beginning having crying two year olds hanging off of me because they're not used to not having my full attention. Now they sometimes join me for some parts of the practice, and my 6 yr old will randomly come to me and say, ""Hi, I'm Adriene."" :-) This has been a wonderful, sometimes emotional, journey. I'm looking forward to choosing my next 30 day journey here. Thank you for you, Adriene. You are a gem.

I'm really sad that this beautiful journey ends this way, it doesn't really feel like home getting so disappointed with myself after hyping myself up for days and thinking that I could do it... it must have also been a bad day for me, and I was already emotional without adding this stress ! I'll keep on practising with you but I guess I'll always make sure that I'm mentally in a good enough place, and check that it seems doable at my level !

1841.0,"Adriene, I have been homeless for two years. One could say I'd been homeless for much longer on some level but two years ago, I made a conscious decision to forego maintaining a physical ""home"" to move into a sense of home that did not depend on external conditions. With just a backpack of supplies, I thust myself into a vulnerability that challenged me, moment-by-moment to show up honestly ‚Äî speaking honestly, listening honestly and living honestly, authentically embodying my core values, principles and wisdom. I leaned into the uncertainty present in every momentary set of circumstances to fully dedicate myself to unearthing the Truth in the heart's center while hitchhiking up and down the West Coast, taking only temporary housing offers and volunteering.

I started Home late, in April, after a short-term housing arrangement turned indetermimable with the pandemic locking down the state. It seemed that I might stay put for a while despite how my heart felt, well, compromised and unheard.

Eventually, I did manage to leave despite the climate and stepped out into an unfamiliar uncertainty. 

Just like everyone else, I feel much more vulnerable in the pandemic climate. Moving about has been central to my life as a homeless person for the last 2 years. Unlike most, I don't have a base in which to take shelter for an indeterminate length of time.

And this has been true for these last couple years but now I can't rely on the support of open doors when I have to move on for whatever reason. I feel vulnerable to making unfortunate and possibly unhealthy compromises to remain sheltered - a condition we know is ultimately unstable anyhow.

So my experience and appreciation of instability is deepening. Surely, none of this will last but neither is relief guaranteed. Life may very well continue to present conditions wherein its inherent instability must be faced on increasingly deeper levels, no choice and no escape. That's a frightening prospect but, of course, that way lies surrender and liberation.

I wept throughout this day's practice. It's humbling to see how much work I still have to do to land ""home"", how my practice has led me here and still I feel frightened, vulnerable and uncertain.

But I know that I see you and I see what you offer; it's not just a way to move that builds physical strength, agility and flexibility ‚Äî these are just by-products ‚Äî but rather a way of seeing and allowing ourselves to be seen, by ourselves and each other.

Adriene, I see you and I know you see me. Because it is not my heart and your heart but THE heart which sees vulnerability with tenderness, compassion and unconditional love. This is always a precious, precious blessing; thank you.

I can't know where this next step will land but I remain open and inviting the path to rise up to meet the four corners of this foot. And wherever I have the chance to lie back and sink into the earth, she'll be there to hold me, she'll have my back and together we'll carry me Home.

Blessings, Adriene. May you always have support for your journey Home. May you always return to your heart in gentleness, beathing deep into love. Thank you.

In kindness and care,
Natasha",UgxBPD9l7zDsExIHlQB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-05-11T16:19:01Z,0.3637464328389585

It gave us structure and a fixture in the day we could look forward to, we also really bonded doing it together. I was doing yoga before but not like this it was without mindfulness and for the result, not the journey now I know there's more to it than that. Today I noticed that unlike a month ago I learned how to incorporate the breath and it makes such a difference.

 throughout the video, i could hear many of the teachings from the previous days cycling through my head, whether it was ""observe"", ""spread your hand across your ribcage as if it were dipped in honey"", ""halfway lift, your version"" or my favorite ""belly to cobra or chaturanga to upward facing dog"", hahahah. i even said ""i am strong"" aloud. this was such a beneficial journey for me, and i can see myself coming back to this video in particular and creating my own flow mixed with notes of what is going on on screen to further enrich the practice. i am so so grateful for this, and i found your channel at the perfect time for me. thank you so much, adriene (and benji!!!) <3333",UgxbtTqQ6AZnBIgMS4B4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2020-05-06T19:14:29Z,0.9994307160377502

But this was a perfect welcome to a beginner like me, who was interested but intimidated. I've recommended it to many and will continue to do so. I appreciate this YWA Channel SO MUCH! I am especially thankful that I was already accustomed to daily practice prior to quarantine. Now it's even more important to get the time in. Sending love to you Adriene & of course to Benji!!!

2002.0,"The music was so powerful to me in this flow (I actually used to find the intro a bit too cheesy but how it has changed!) - triggering the daily notion of clicking on YWA, all the different feelings that I've had at the start of a practice - the ups and the downs. But each day being greeted with the intro music and again at the end of my practice, feeling restored, healed and ready for the day.  It served as a reminder of the journey we have all been on together. This at home practice, on my matt with Adrienne. Like the millions of others united in their destination but with different paths or meanings.  I started practising YWA in 2016. I wasn't sure this feeling could come from a virtual class, but I carry your voice in your head throughout my day beyond my practice; ""Set your intention"", ""Let go of what's not serving you"", ""where the mind goes, energy flows"", ""we call this the Texas T""

2010.0,"Having done 'Revolution' and 'True', I knew Day 30 was going to be a freestyle practice and I wasn't looking forward to it. Not one bit. But this time was different. I decided to keep my eyes closed and to just go with the flow. And it worked ! I peaked at my screen a few times and was amazed to find myself in (almost) the same posture as Adriene.
This practice was wonderful. I was able to fully commit to the journey for the first time, even if it took me 34 days. I will be back to the mat tomorrow with 'True' which I didn't manage to finish the first time around. Maybe I will complete the practice in 30 days this time. Maybe I won't.

Today, completing this practice I cried because I was giving myself so much love, deep inside I was telling myself ""You see? You can do whatever you want. You are amazing. ""
I  guess I finally found the movement that makes sense for my body, something that besides being challenging, I love to do. During yoga I know there is no right and wrong.

I have never done any yoga before so I was unsure what to get out of this but I am so thankful for the opportunity to go through this. I was mildly panicking when you said no mic, but I was actually able to follow along and I do feel stronger at a lot of the poses than when I started.

2096.0,"Just finished and I feel so relaxed and accomplished. This journey has made me healthier in mind and body. It has given me a reason to stop what I am doing and connect with myself every single day. My family knows when I say, ""I am going to do my yoga"" to allow me time to be alone. As a young adult trying to figure out my life during these tough times, I am beyond grateful to have this escape. I'm still learning to give myself permission to let go.

I've never done an unguided practice (without a voice telling me the moves) and the first 10 minutes I was constantly trying to look at my screen to see if I was keeping up with the moves. About 20 minutes in I swear I started hearing your voice saying when to breathe in and out haha and wow by 30 minutes in something must have happened during these 30 days because I swear we got in sync. I would look away from the screen, breathe into the movements and by the time I looked back you were doing the exact same thing! It's like our minds just were connected (as crazy as that sounds).

I felt like a baby bird being thrown out of the nest for the first time and not knowing whether I could fly. It was a bit of a nervous first flight but the last 29 days have taken me to this place and I realised I had everything I needed to go solo. I'll be sticking with Day 30 for a while to help me remember all the moves to create my own unique flow. I could have done with a Day 31...Day 30 with the mic on and Day 31 without, just to save me looking up to see what the next move was going to be but I can't thank you enough or recommend this challenge enough.

2143.0,"JUST FINISHED A SECOND GO AROUND! !I never thought I would be ""A Yoga Guy""... In December of 2019 I did my first couple YWA sessions (and first ever real yoga sessions for me). I found YWA looking for videos geared towards back and neck pain as I am a graphic designer/single dad and spend most of the day at my desk or chasing around a toddler. I continued these sessions through January and decided to take on the Journey Home for the month of February. In conjunction with a few lifestyle changes, I lost 12 pounds!! I was so happy! What was better yet, my neck and back pain were going away. March was more of an every-other-day yoga practice kind of month and my weight stayed about the same. So in April, especially with the quarantine going on, I decided to take on the challenge for a second time. I'm thrilled to say I lost another 8 pounds, making it an even 20!!!! Not only that, but to see the improvement in my flexibility and strength in that time frame was awesome! So I've decided to do another challenge for next month but will take on one of your other sessions (any recommendations?).

2164.0,"Just finished my 30th day, body feels stronger and more limber. Daily meditation practice that comes with it has been really useful for staying grounded during these times. Something that would have made this final practice feel like a better 'sendoff' would have been if it were verbal only (very basic, minimal instruction) and no video. 


Craning my neck out of line with my spine to see the video for the visual queue made me feel frustrated, because I was constantly reacting and playing catch up rather than anticipating how I'm going to transition into the next position. Wasn't able to sink in and enjoy the juicy parts either because I had to keep an eye on the screen. Hard to turn inward with this format of video.


That said, this series is awesome and I've recommended it to many friends.Adriene is a wonderful teacher, I love her philosophy of self-compassion and grace, ""finding what feels good"" makes this practice easier to stick with.

2191.0,"Dearest, darling Adriene, and all of you wonderful humans practicing alongside me, thank you. During this quarantine and uncertain point in my life, where I have completed college but am so unsure of the next steps and am anxious about the pandemic, this practice and reading your comments have been a rock. Before quarantine, I never thought yoga was for me. But I have found so much dang peace moving my body with my breath. How unexpected today's practice was! I had no idea today would be a time for us to try on our own, with Adriene practicing with us. Without Adriene's voice, oh my goodness, my thoughts came rushing in big time!  Memories of my childhood washed over me, ideas and goals of setting out to do this practice, a deep longing to feel something meaningful or spiritual, reminders to clear my mind and try and focus on my breath. And, for some reason, I sensed a lot of fear/anxiety within my body, within my mind. I think I just have so many gosh darn hopes and dreams, as all of us humans do :) And I really, really, DEEPLY want to strive to be a certain kind of person--someone who just lights up with kindness for herself and others. Hahahaha anyway, as all of this was rushing through my head,  instead of grounding myself to Adriene's voice, I realized I could do the same thing with the music. So I kept my deep breathing, and did the best I could. Had to toss in some yummy hip-openers! And the 40 minutes did fly by--definitely felt more like twenty. 


I hope everyone is staying safe and well during this crazy time. Thank you all so much for being here. Thank you Adriene, for making a beautiful way of being/feeling accessible to all. 


Thank you, Benji, for being Benji. :) 


I am so scared for what is to come, and sad for certain things that have past. But I also know that there is a beauty in the unknown, and so many people are here along this path with me.

2235.0,"It took so much longer than I anticipated to finish this journey, and I think that's telling of a lot of my mentalities and neuroses. Even during this practice, I kept finding myself thinking, how much time is left, what pose do I do, should I be doing what she was doing. But a quiet little Adriene voice in the back of my head said something along the lines of ""you're probably thinking, okay I have to do warrior next and *phwoosh * jam into the next pose, but can you find a way to relish in this posture, this moment, right now?"" and that was so important to me. I discovered that in yoga, as well as in life, I'm always thinking of what I have to do next, how it needs to be done etc etc, and as such I miss out on so much happening RIGHT NOW. I think that's what my ""Home"" is. Right now, in this moment. And it's surprisingly harder than I thought to live in the moment..
I thought that by the end of the 30 days (or 4 months in my case) I'd have figured it all out. That I'd be ""Home"". And as such, I felt a bit of... disappointment at the end of this practice? Because there wasn't any eureka moment, I didn't feel like ""ah, I'm home now."" But I'm proud, because I know that this 30 day challenge was more like a gateway, and a guide, leading me to the road that would take me home. Tomorrow I'll be attempting to commit to a daily practice, and hopefully as I go, I'll truly be able to find my way back home.

Then I went through all I thought about but she was still going- I didn't do enough, I should have kept going, I could have got more, I should have breathed more, I should have held it longer. So I did a few more, I watched as she finished and stayed in savasana so I could be reminded of what I could add, and let myself listen to my thoughts as they passed. Then it comes to a close. I realized that if I'm not doing as much as someone else, it makes me feel bad, but I did what I felt and that's good enough. I realized that I did some things imperfect and it made me feel bad, but I did them and I'll improve, so I can let that go and move forward.

2274.0,"Hi Adrienne,
I just finished your Home 30 days journey and I can't tell you how much this meant to me. Two years ago I herniated a disk in my spine and it gave me crippling sciatica- I couldn't run, bend over, or lift things. I went through physical therapy, started doing weight training to strengthen my back. During quarantine I finally have had the time and been feeling healed enough to try out yoga again for the first time in years. This sessions meant the world to me, to come to the end of the 30 days and feel flexible, strong, and anchored in my body in a way I haven't in years. Thank you! At one point during the flow I did a forward fold and grabbed my toes, not to prove anything, but just because it felt good, and it made me tear up because two years ago my doctor told me it was possible I'd never be able to touch my toes again, even with exercise. So, two years post injury I'm getting my Personal Training certification and transitioning into a career in fitness because fitness changed my life and gave me my body back, and this 30 days working through the Home series has felt like another integral and powerful step in my recovery.

2314.0,"Oh Adriene, what a journey! I loved every single day of this journey. I must say I got scared when you said you would put the mic off. I was so stressed and I was sure I wouldn't be able to keep up the pace. But then, everytime I would turn my head to look at the screen, I would see you smiling back at us. Every. Single. Time. It gave me so much strength. I was hoping to hear your sweet voice at the end of the video... But when I looked up, I saw a black screen with a wonderful quote from O'Donohue. It made me smile until I saw my own reflection on the screen, it's like I was smiling to myself. And what a wonderful smile it was. I was (and still am) so happy. I burst into tears, tears of joy, pride and love. I couldn't have hoped for a better ending.
How do you do this, Adriene? Thank you so much! I've got nothing but love for you and this wonderful community you have created.

2323.0,Thank you so much Adriene for these videos and for today's practice especially. It was simply the perfect way to end these 30 days. I actually got very emotional at the end which surprised me. I started this journey at the end of March when we had been in lockdown for about 10 days in Ireland already and I was not coping well with the lack of routine and feeling very lonely. Practicing yoga for the last 30 days has not only made the last month bearable but actually enjoyable. I am definitely not going to stop my daily practice and will follow May's monthly calendar.

I love the power it brings me, I love the sweat that drips off my forehead when you say ""come on 2 more."" I love relaxing on my bed after a long 30 minute session. I've never felt like this before. I've reached day 30 many times before, and it doesn't matter how many times you've reached the end point, but what you learned and the journey you took that got you there.

2384.0,"Dear Adrienne, 
I started and ended this practise with tears rolling down my cheeks. I started practising with you in 2017, but could never make it through a whole 30 days of yoga. I've been on and off since then, never feeling like I had the time or mental energy to fully commit to an everyday practise. 
I began this yoga journey Home 30 days ago, on the day that New Zealand entered its first day of lockdown. I figured that I would have the time and need the routine, and I was right on both accounts. Although most of my practises ended up being in the wee hours of the morning, I began to treasure the twenty minutes we spent together. You became a beacon of certainty in this time of huge emotional and mental turmoil. You allowed me to take back ownership of my body, kept me moving even on my most difficult of days, and most importantly allowed me to feel truly proud of accomplishing 30 continuous days of yoga. 
We are exiting the strictest stage of lockdown at the start of next week, and I can't wait to take your wisdom and daily practise back into the world with me.

2412.0,"Dear Adriene,

Honestly, I admit my 30th day practice was not my best practice through out this Home journey. For the first half of the video, somehow I was irked by the abscence of your voice guidance and I couldn't keep my breathing steady. I was frustrated.

I found it really surprising, since I always love your sessions, this was the first! I even paused and tried to assess my feelings. Like, what is going on??

After calming down, I tried to continue the video. Then, throughout the last half, I could feel my 'inner'  was stopped. My feeling is not flowing, stagnant. And while doing the movements and listening to the music, I wept. My tears just melted and melted.

I think everybody is trying to adapt during this pandemic, so does myself. And i thought i am doing okay, but clearly I am not. I had a feeling I had numbed myself so I could have my quarantine days at home undisturbed.

But through this 30th day practice, my stagnant feeling started to flow again. I communicated with myself, accepting that I am not okay and so does everyone in this world.

Then, I remembered. Journey home is not always smooth one, and I am gladly accept this with an open heart.

Thank you for this experience, Adriene. May we all accept our feelings, good and bad. Namaste.",Ugx4MUE2LDiDl8YvE6l4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-23T13:06:01Z,0.9104405641555786

2435.0,"I just finished this practice down here in SW Austin, typing from my yoga mat, quarantined at home like the rest of us. Pretty emotional right now -- been a tough 24 hours. My old dog, Henry, hurt his shoulder on a long walk in Slaughter Creek and had to go to the vet yesterday where I couldn't even get out of the car to be with him while they examined him. He's okay, just getting old, they said. But I was reminded kind of crushingly of his mortality, and then of everyone's mortality, this thing we're all thinking about but not really saying or implicating ourselves in. And so, when Benji entered the show today -- his down dog turned into your down dog turned into my down dog -- I just kinda felt it all again. I'm so glad to be home with Henry, so glad that I completed this journey -- I'd never done much yoga before this. A few classes at the gym this winter, but that's about it. I feel more now, I think. This has helped me so much, allowed me access to things I didn't know were there, made me stronger and more vulnerable at the same time. I can't thank you enough. I really mean that.

2452.0,"I will be honest, every time day 30 swings around I find myself lacking the courage (and the perseverance!)  to be alone with myself for whatever amount of time I need. However, this session was different in many ways. I did not have time to practice in the morning, so it was moved to the night. That said, I have not had the pleasure to brave the final day of 30 Days of Yoga, I found the silence to be intimidating. I struggled to be utterly alone with myself, and whenever the final session would swing by, I would just begin a new 30 days of Yoga journey. Yet, I found myself willingly, albeit a bit nervously, participating this time around. I followed you, but I did deviate and included multiple push-ups and intense moments where I found myself pushing myself not under your guidance, but my own. I wept at the end of it, for I truly felt I had found my way home. This quarantine has put my mind in places I did not think it could go, and yet you managed to gently pull me away from the edge and guide me home. Thank you, Adriene. I have been following your practices for nearly a year now, and I found incredible joy and pride when I whispered the names of the poses out of recognition. I cannot thank you enough, you are the universal yogi and have brought immense amounts of peace into my life, Thank you so much.

I didn't count on yoga being something I looked forward to at the end of each day or something I would continue doing after this challenge was done. But here I am; day 30 of the challenge and so not ready to leave yoga behind. 
When I saw that this last video was 41 minutes I almost didn't do it because God I'm tired today, but I sat down on my mat and pressed play. When I heard that you wouldn't guide us like you normally do, I almost stopped this video, cause there was no way I could do yoga alone and just make it all up. But now I was already on the mat, so I didn't feel like giving up already. So I tried. Just doing what felt good. And then all of a sudden the music stopped and I was about to complain that you turned off the music mid video. Until i realized, that the video was done and I had made my own yoga rutine for the last 40 minutes.

I started it a week before the UK first when into lockdown for C-19 (already had a regular practice and dipped in and out of yours every so often) as I wanted something to help me stay healthy in both body and mind as I dealt with a huge amount of uncertainty, for both myself and my loved ones, of whom I miss dearly. It... truly truly has. I'm finishing this practice stronger, and happier than when I started - despite everything that has happened in that 30 days outside of the mat. I am finishing with tears - mostly of joy and gratitude. And a promise that I will keep coming back, every day, until the end of lockdown and beyond.

My downward dogs are better aligned, my balances last longer and I am stronger!! I thought I'd be the only person still doing this in March/April, but the comments here have proven me wrong.

2700.0,"I can't believe what these 30 days of yoga did for my body and mind, especially my body. I was so stiff and sore on the neck, shoulders, back, you name it. My posture was terrible, I was tired all the time, headaches, etc. My sister lifts weights and she always told me that I should do it too to strengthen my back. She has been doing it for years and she still has occasional back pain. After 30 days of yoga, it's all gone for me... I'm not a spiritual person at all, but you don't have to be to enjoy yoga. I never liked exercising because it always felt like a chore. When I was on the gym for a year I obviously noticed my body changed, fat was gone, muscles were in, but I almost never really felt a big difference. Now I know why. Today I am so aware of my body that I almost FEEL it changing, like on the inside and not just when I look at the mirror. It's honestly amazing and kinda... spiritual?? What is this sorcery, Adriene?? I am not a spiritual person! Am I? One thing I know for sure though: I am never looking back. I finally found a physical activity that makes me feel good and doesn't feel like a chore and I think it has done more for me mentality than I realize. I feel confident enough to make my own yoga flow from now on, but I'll come back to your channel always and do your other videos too (and new ones!).

2705.0,"This may be an unpopular opinion but I highly dislike that you took off the sound, I couldn't finish the video because it wasn't even relaxing for me. 

My neck and back were hurting more because I was constantly having to look forward during every pose to see what you were doing. My muscles in my abdomen and leg were twisted the wrong way because I was unsure of which way to turn without guidance and how to do certain moves without looking up. The constant looking up and doing the move wrong without guidance ruined my whole calm and made me anxious.

I thought maybe the point is to make up our own flow rather than follow yours then why include the video at all then? Why not just tell us to practice on our own or put a calming scene? Because I tried doing my own thing but then would get anxiety see you in a completely different motion. I'm here to be taught yoga, if I wanted to create my own flow I wouldn't even be here. 

I couldn't finish it because I decided finally to just not try to follow you at all but then I run out of moves to do...I am a beginner so I can do a couple basic things but expecting me to do 40 whole minutes of freestyle is a bit much in my opinion :/ 

I think for my 30th day I will just go follow one of your videos on yoga for neck or back pain and do that instead now that those areas are screwed up from this. That's what feels good for me. To each their own.",UgyjRyZbSRQlGYqk1th4AaABAg,2.0,1.0,2020-04-08T03:03:55Z,-0.9987781643867493

2719.0,"It's April 6th, quarantine in Moscow and the first day of a new cycle. I am achey, irritated, low, generally upset and have a mild cold. 
I was so angry at myself for feeling this way, as I've been looking forward to this practice immensely. I felt like I failed, ruined everything, succumbed to despair and disappointed the very essence of Yoga with Adriene. Breath lots of love in sounded like a cruel joke today (especially considering the blocked nose). I wanted to postpone until I felt better.
But I showed up. And decided to allow myself to just BE. With who I am today. And move in a way that feels good today. 
I cried through most of the practice and did the silliest moves, but my Half Moon was the best it's ever been. And then I look up - and Adriene is doing it, too. And I remember that we all have days like this, every single one of us. It's universal.
So why not embrace it? Sometimes this is where my head is, and it‚Äôs a part of my Home.  And it‚Äôs also good, because in it‚Äôs own twisted, neurotic, touchy way it want the best for me, tries to protect me.
I am my Home.
And I am ready to face the day with tenderness and love  - for myself.

2732.0,"I'm not going to lie- I thought about stopping this video about 4 times during practice today and just ending it there.
I thought 40 min, all this flow, choreographed, this is too much, too hard.
I got into a real wave of depression all day and honestly didn't even expect to be doing this last video. I looked through some pictures that made me laugh, got a glass of water, and turned it on.


When these thoughts came up I had to remind myself what I've learned these past thirty days - that I don't have to compare myself to anyone, that I can find what feels good. For me that meant some extra childs poses for breaks and chaturagas because I really enjoyed how my arms muscles felt in them. 


This past thirty days has not been easy. And I'll admit that I'm not like OH MY GOD THIS JOURNEY WAS AWESOME AND WONDERFUL AND IM HOOKED ON YOGA. A lot of times, it was super hard. My mind would wander, I would get mad at myself for not wanting to work hard enough, yadda yadda. But it's not how easy it is that gives it value. It's how strong I've become in the process, how fluid my movements are, are clear my mind can be. It's about regaining control over who I am and who I want to be, while cherishing what is. This journey has given me confidence, strength, and power. And that's why it has meant so much to me.",UgxDzgjxYq6WkWJcAUl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-05T04:15:47Z,0.993862509727478

2781.0,"Dear Adrienne. Thank you. Thank you with all my heart. I did this yoga journey in January-February, and then life overtook me and there was three sessions I didn't finish. Until a few days ago, after two weeks of confinement, I came back and wanted to finish. I find magical that the days aligned so beautifully. This morning, I decided to give myself silence and no outside noise in the morning in no form at all (whether it be a book, a podcast, a text message or anything) and I was delighted to find out that the practice was in silence as well. It was my favourite. And then at the end, deep sobs came out. Because, today was supposed to be the day where I moved to a new city and finally start building a new life. I obviously cannot due to the circumstances. This session allowed me to live this emotion, to be disappointed, but to also know that it will be ok and that home is within. So thank you, I appreciate you and what you do. It is truly magical. Best of luck in these times.",UgxGXQQIBjyG05jKhUt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-03-31T11:17:43Z,0.9993901252746582

I really hope you get to read this. I am a person who struggled severely with an eating disorder. I entered residential treatment in October of 2019 and am currently in an IOP program. Your videos were recommended to me by one of the therapists, and I am so glad she told me about you. I have a history of over exercise to the point of destroying my body. You are helping me to cultivate a better relationship with my body, and to find a way to move that empowers rather than tears down. Each day along my journey with you, I'm learning how to move mindfully for health, rather than to burn calories or judge/critic my body.

2839.0,"I started last year's 30 day journey but didn't stick with it, so this year I committed myself to finishing this one no matter how long it took, no matter how many days I missed. I stuck with it daily until I got sick about halfway through. For a few weeks I couldn't do yoga, and it took me a bit to get back into the daily practice, but I remembered what I had told myself in the beginning and I kept at it. Getting back into it was difficult, because I had lost a lot of the progress I had made, and I was very discouraged. Slowly, I started to see it come back and I realized that I could do this. When you said today that you were taking the microphone off, it terrified me. But I decided to trust in you and myself and it resulted in one of the best practices I've ever had- something I didn't think I was capable of doing for myself. I heard your voice in my head the whole time, reminding me to breathe, to take up space, and to do what feels good. I was surprised at how many times I glanced at the screen and found you in the same position as myself, as well as the amount of times we were doing different things and that I was okay with that. I teared up at the end of this practice today, filled with so many emotions. Thank you, Adriene, for this wonderful gift. I've made yoga a daily part of my life now, and I intend to stick with it as long as I am able. Namaste <3",UgxJXUhSCy3s70RdIvp4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2020-03-25T14:08:13Z,0.9980460405349731

2841.0,"Oh man, I was so intimidated when you said 'I'll be turning off the microphone now'. I genuinely thought I'd be completely at a loss of what to do and about ten minutes in would already be in corpse pose, thinking I had reached the 40 minutes already. But once I got going, it was actually surprisingly easy to go from one pose to the next, following the kind of flow you have taught us. I peeked at the screen now and again, I'll admit it, but got over not being in the same pose as you like nothing. It was okay. This was my own 40 minutes to fill in as I please with all the great tools and poses you've taught me over these 30 days. And aside from some minor mishaps in half moon and crow, it went really well and the 40 minutes were over much faster than I anticipated.

2854.0,I always look forward to Adriene's  30 days of yoga. It's a good way to get back into a daily yoga routine to keep you going for the rest of the year. This is not one of my favourite days because I know it's the end of it but also because I keep having to look at the screen to try and figure out what's next. If you're like me and  to follow the routine closely I suggest you watch session once through first. I actually didn't enjoy it until I decided to allow myself to make mistakes.

2863.0,"The last 30-day yoga ended with the same and this second time is no different for me - I just am not the type to have or create my own routine on the spot :-( So I stopped midway, slightly annoyed, because if no voice is there to guide me, I constatnly peek at the screen and it is distracting. I tried my best but no, 23 minutes in, this is not for me. I will finish up with a short video from Adriene's list to have a feeling of closure but this did not work for me.
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY that I do not appreciate all Adriene's hard work and her guidance for those 30 days. It took me 40 days, during which I had to say goodbye to my Grandma and to my beloved tom-cat, we laid the foundations of our house and the pandemic broke out... And all this time, this mantra resonates in my mind: You've got the tools. So thank you so much for that, Adriene, and I'll sure keep yoga-ing with you in the future!

2887.0,"thank you adrienne for this amazing yoga journey that you took us on. As i lied there in shavasana trying to clear my mind and have a moment of stillness, i realized that (of course) not all my problems are suddenly solved. i still can't concentrate that well, i fall over in half moon and i am impatient and on edge pretty much all the time. But i also felt an immense, stubborn love for myself, something i never really felt before this deeply. I realized that no matter what, I will continue to love myself whether i love me back or not. I will continue to do yoga even though it takes me great convincing to get on the mat because i know how good i'll feel afterwards, i will eat healthy food instead of a diet of chips and ice cream because i know that i feel way better and i will be kind to myself and all those around me even tho i want to snap at people and tear myself down. Because I love myself and i love living! From the bottom of my heart, thank you adrienne for being a role model, a wonderful yoga instructor and an inspiration in kindness, patience and love. ‚ô•",UgwOafOFQ4u6smMoiNR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-03-21T11:08:14Z,0.9987843632698059

What I've rekindled is the playful essence of my spirit and my hands and feet's spirit too! I was playing in boat pose and started flicking my feet in point and flex. Imagining little splashes of water. I've held a grudge again my feet for so long because they pronante in the wrong way and have large bunions. I've seen them as this stand still obstacle in my movement practices. I never truly feel grounded my feet. The part of me the literally supports my whole body to connect with the earth, I've shunned as a part of me.

With these magical splashes, I forgive you my feet. You deserve much more love and support from me.

I‚Äôve been really appreciative of this practice, and would like to do more. Adriene, I‚Äôm just wondering if this is the standard for ending each series? It‚Äôs going to be hard for me if so. Maybe there‚Äôs a balance between the music, the opportunity to create a personal practice and use the language and sound guidance? Maybe if you named the next pose and let folks move into it on their own? I‚Äôm asking because it would be more healthful for me, and I‚Äôd like to complete each series.

I followed Adriene for the most part, got in to my own groove a bit, and was shocked when I realized that 40min had flew by! I felt calm for most of the practice, but when I saw Adriene closing the practice, I got so emotional. Tears came to my eyes. This year's journey went so well for me- I'm proud to say that I only missed one day in the whole 30 days! (I was traveling in Jan, so I started on my own in Feb.)

Last year (Year 2), I managed about half the time before following along because I‚Äôd run out of ideas. This year, at last, I felt quite a natural flow from one sequence of movements to the next. I have never tried practicing yoga on my own, so this was a really significant step for me. I really enjoyed the time to feel my way into each posture, making it work for me.

I have done my own yoga flows in the past but I realized through this freedom and trust you invited us to participate in how much I have been relying on the guidance of others as of late.  I teach and preach inner authority, alignment, personal power and yet, I've been abandoning my own while I shift into new and uncharted waters.  I felt so much fear come up as the practice began and sat with it all.  I used the opportunity throughout class to remember that I have the wisdom, I don't need to go fast or do it right or perform for anyone.  That the way I move is perfect and right for me and that's all I need to remember and come back to.  This was so profound and so perfectly timed.

3098.0,"Dear Adriene,

I've been going through a rough patch and this yoga journey has been the only thing I've been able to stick to daily for the last 30 days. Actually, most days, it's been the only thing I was genuinely looking forward to. It kept me going, time and again. In your own words, my yoga mat literally and figuratively got my back. Today, I sat down on my mat at the golden hour. At first the prospect of going through this session without your vocal guidance distressed me; I thought I'd only get stuck in my head, afraid of missing a ""cue"", of not knowing when or how to move. But only a few minutes into it, it dawned on me that that's not the point; yoga is not a choreography, it's a language. A therapeutic language. I never trusted my body as much as I did during this final practise, however clumsy the outcome. I actually, genuinely listened‚Äîto my breath, to my body, to my needs. I'm not talking about a hyperfocus kind of mode; it rather felt like I was letting go of something, in the subtlest ways. I melted into the moment, into the environnement and sounds and light around me, into my body. At the end, I lied down with my left hand on my heart, the right one on my stomach‚Äîthe two areas that I probably tend to mistreat the most. It took me a minute to notice the tears after I felt the steady, loyal beating of my heart and the warmth of my abdomen. After this 30-day journey, life is still what it is, sure. I wasn't expecting a miracle. But something has changed withing me. I finally want to take care of myself. And from here on out, yoga is going to be a central point in this process. It's only the beginning. So much love x",UgyTHXNkUt0edx2zVeR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-02-25T17:53:25Z,0.9748535752296448

Lovely way to finish the 30 days challenge although if I had one criticism I would have is that it would be really helpful if you were to put a bell or sound at each switch of pose.. was lovely to do it on our own but was distracting for the longer holds of poses when having to keep an eye on your movements. If there was a sound when poses changed would only have to look up at that.

I was a little scared and worried about doing yoga without you telling me what to do (I think it may be somewhat easier to do it that way), but once I started doing it, I couldn't believe that I did yoga by myself for 35 minutes!!! You've taught me the vocabulary as well as the moves and allowed me to create my own freestyle yoga practice! I think the main thing that I learned was just to take time for yourself and to love yourself (whatever that may be). It was great! Using you as a guide to remind myself of the moves, I was able to do my favourite poses and hit spots that were ""yummy"" and helped me feel better. Thank you for this journey! I'm going to continue with the next calendar. Namaste!",UgxYJgZG9m8y2gFkR5l4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-02-24T12:31:35Z,0.9986365437507629

3127.0,"Although I absolutely love all of Adriene's workouts (she's my official ""yoga instructor""; this video didn't work out very well for me (or the other 131 people who gave it a thumbs down).  Adriene, in my opinion, is a pioneer.  She gently guides and instructors her students as she takes us through the various poses.  I can't take a fast passed yoga class and her videos are perfect for me.  It's impossible to watch an instructor AND get into these poses at the same time.  Especially figuring out what the next pose will be while in downward dog with my head upside down at that time.  Having to keep my eyes peeled on my laptop screen without simply following the guided instructions of her voice, made it impossible for me to benefit from this video in an easy ""flow"" manner.  I'm not alone in that opinion so, hopefully, none of Adriene's other classes are silent as this one was (I've taken over 50 of her videos and a few are my favorites which I do all the time!).

Well this year, this year I did it! So many feelings, but gratitude kept coming up. Grateful that I have a body that allows me to move, grateful for you, Adriene, that you provide us with amazing yoga over and over again and grateful to be able to share my thoughts with such an amazing community.

I've ordered books recently and want to start my own practice, but you have taught me the basics and i appreciate what you do immensely. However, the last day of both 30 days I've done, it's just painful trying to follow you without audio cues. It completely takes me out of the practice.

3193.0,"Hello, Adriene!
I started this journey a little late and with a lot of unhappiness in my heart. While I can't say that yoga helped against that, I certainly feel like even the motivation to wake up early every day and do it was a clear boost for my spirit and morale. I was so very surprised when I saw some signs of muscles on my arms, as well as when I realized that I gained some more length in my very inflexible legs! Today was my biggest surprise by far during this journey and it happened when the usual outro music softly started playing. With my hands in front of my heart, I just started crying and even as I write this I have tears falling down my cheek. They're not tears of sadness, nor happiness, but something else. It feels as if I've been watching a piece of art or something highly inspirational.

But I am babbling now! I want to thank you for being you, Adriene and for everything you do for us. I hope you'll remain this bright being which you are or grow into an even brighter and warmer one. You are wonderful and I wish the best to Benji and you! I will try to go through the other 30 days challenges and see where I'll end up. :)

3206.0,"A month ago, I began a new chapter of my life, I moved from Sweden to Australia, to be an au pair for 6 months. 
This is what I wrote in my journal after today‚Äôs practise:
‚ÄúI was just at the end of the practice, thumbs at my third eye and crying from being humbled and so, so grateful for all my yoga pals around the world and Adriene, when C and A walked in. D had another bad evening and L needed me to watch them. Sometimes, things just don‚Äôt go according to plan, or the plan changes abruptly, and that‚Äôs a beautiful part of the journey too. Today, I‚Äôve had to try to let go of the need to know and plan what comes next. In this, during practice when my mind wanted to continuously plan the next pose, and when I looked into the travels I want to do after I‚Äôve finished au pairing. /../ Can I bring back my intention with this trip, to go with the flow and not plan too much ahead? I want to take one thing at a time and see where it leads me. I‚Äôm on a journey. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt decide where it ends‚Äô...‚Äù

I‚Äôm so grateful for this journey, this practice, for lovingly having my back through this first month of a new adventure. When the change and newness has been too much, it has been my comfort. It has helped me reflect and grow, feel my feelings, and has grounded me. It has helped me slow down and take notice, when things have moved too quickly. It supported the transition of moving across the world, and Adriene, I cannot thank you enough for that. HOME created a home within myself when I left everything and everyone that has ever been home to me far away, and now that safety will forever be there. I am so loved, by other people but also by myself on a new level. It‚Äôs intrinsic, unconditional, and will follow wherever I go next. That inner support makes me brave. It makes me believe that what I do, and how I do it matters. That is true, for all of us. I love you all.",UgwzHivzDNjMBwNEsI14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-02-17T08:48:33Z,0.9983556866645813

It was strange not to hear your comforting and encouraging words but I found myself following your moves on screen and was pretty much second-guessing correctly the next move. 



You are a wonderful teacher Adriene, and have taken me from the sofa to (almost) daily practice in the space of about 8 weeks (I started my journey just before Christmas). In that time I've learnt how to breath properly again, rediscovered stretches and moves I don't think my body has known since I was a toddler, gained some new strength and balance, and feel a new sense of purpose and well-being. I even find myself having a secret little stretch when I'm doing something mundane like washing the dishes or brushing my teeth!

But when I started HOME, I said that I would not judge the process. That I wouldn‚Äôt say or think anything negative about my body for not being able to hold a pose or for having random pains on occasion.  And I wouldn‚Äôt beat myself up for anything that came up during the 30 days. So I figured out how to keep going.

And I finally finished Day 30 on Valentines Day, of all days!  To me, that feels perfect.

3269.0,"Thank you Adriene for this, I do these journeys with you every year and love them and am so grateful for them and all your hard work! 
However I must honestly admit that I really dislike this tradition on day 30 to take off your microphone. Like someone else also mentioned in the comments, it‚Äôs frustrating and very difficult to follow along without audio cues because I‚Äôm forced to look at the screen and crunch my neck all the time making me feel rather uncomfortable. I‚Äôm a yoga teacher myself (which you have inspired me to become!) so there‚Äôs really not a problem with me not being able to listen to my own voice, I can easily do my own flow and listen to my body etc but the reason that I do yoga with someone else is because I‚Äôd like to follow along with their flow, and that‚Äôs incredibly difficult to do without audio cues. If I‚Äôm in childs pose for example, how do I know when to come out? If I come out whenever it feels right to me, I might miss out on a whole sequence and see that you‚Äôre suddenly in a completely different pose that might need another pose to come into it, and so delaying me even further, in which case I‚Äôll get so much more out of it by practicing on my own. For this reason I enjoy just watching your day 30‚Äôs each year to avoid myself frustration. I love the sequences every year and at least it serves me as a kind of meditation. I just wanted to share my personal experience with you and I hope you‚Äôll appreciate my honesty! I love your channel and have been following since your early days. Keep up the great work!

Always do my Yoga outside, but this time its different all around is destruction of our trees, buildings, etc and the two trees nearby has broken branches.

3293.0,"I love your channel, and have enjoyed every video (I usually spend 2+ hours a day doing yoga from your channel) up to this point, but I found it frustrating to be left to my own devices on the last day. While I know most of the moves already, it's hard to know when you're switching, so I end up looking up at the screen almost constantly to make sure I'm not missing poses (which I did, and the other ones were compromised by my looking up at the screen.) This made it impossible for me to continue keeping focus on my breath/core. The fact this happened to be the longest video of the series just made it more frustrating. I stuck through til the end in the hopes I'd still feel good after, but I didn't. The way I see it is- if I wanted to do yoga without any instructions, I wouldn't be on Youtube watching beginner videos in the first place.

I was so moved at the very end, when the HOME theme song hit. The emotions and tears came out of nowhere. I was legit crying! And that hadn't yet happened to me in this series, even though reading comments, I see it has happened with others. Reflecting on it though, the release of emotions may be because I am so busy in my life off of the mat, that when I come to the mat to practice with you and this beautiful community we have created, I feel such gratitude and profound peace inside myself. And knowing that this HOME series has wrapped up is like... an acknowledgement that we have done it yet again. I had done Dedicate and True before this, and...the music incorporated in today's practice was so meaningful- like a nod to series past. I love this channel, this community, and the way yoga (and your presentation of it) has shone a light on the inner teacher and the higher self within me.

I was just concentrating  on my breath and left myself guided by my soul and my body. It was the first  time after a long period where I've trusted myself again and proved  that I am capable of doing something.

I was ready. I just started crying from the very beginning with her words and hold my tears during the practice at several moments. I was very excited and nervous as if it was a test. I wasn't always synchronized with her but I didn't feel bad about it. Her instructions resonated in my head and I said a lot of them out loud to give me confidence, the name of the postures, the mantras... One that really stuck for me  on this Home journey was "" Find your footing"". A great metaphor I can use off the mat. 
Everything was really dynamic, I felt my heart racing , I enjoyed the effort with a smile. The music was fascinating too because it was the ""Home"" theme. I finally arrived to the end of this journey really happy with my accomplishments. I needed to let go some heavy burden that I've been carrying around for more time than necessary.

Even we do not see changes much our body changes and we can not do all the postures, our flexibility got better. And what is the most important, we look forward to exercise. We liked the fact that we could exercise together. That was important for us, and we liked that it was kind of surprise what is waiting for us for the next class. During our last class without the guidance, just music, we realized that we still have to work on remembering the patterns so we decided to continue with another 30 days challenges. Which one you would recommend, the one from last year? Some of the postures are really hard for us. Like changing the positions to get the leg from plank to the front. Same to return the leg bag to the standing position. Our feeling is our arm is too short but may be there are some advice or trick that we did not figure out yet.

There were times I was joyously happy and sometimes where I was totally frustrated. all this culminated today, where out of nowhere, when we put the 29 days altogether, I slowly became deeply connected to a sadness that I was able to release in a heavy wave of emotion at the end of the practice and I have felt so light since! I was pretty amazed at how much I remembered and was able to do without you telling me to as well!

I just finished the challenge because I came down with the flu around Day 15. I must admit, I was heartbroken to finish behind everyone else... but I finished, and I am so happy! Throughout this challenge I have gained SO MUCH flexibility!!! I can now do the splits, touch my forehead to my knees in forward fold (with straight legs) and touch my heels to the mat in downward dog! I have to admit, these are things I never thought I would be able to do. Yoga has been the one constant throughout this crazy, crazy month... some days, between work and school, it was the only time I had for myself... and most of my days have been 16 hours long! Basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say is... thank you, for everything. You are truly amazing... we all are!

Meaning I wasn't giving my all to each pose and it didn't flow like usual. The whole point of this for me is having a guide, if I'd wanted to make up my own routine I wouldn't be here.

this past 30 days have been a magical journey, a real shift in perspective. the synchronicities all around me are mind blowing. so many things about the ‚Äújourney home.‚Äù how fitting. ‚Äúhow‚Äôd they know?‚Äù it‚Äôs almost comical to me looking back now. that the answers i was seeking were within me all along. i can‚Äôt thank you enough, adriene (and benji)! i am grateful for this platform, and your willingness to serve not only yourself but others all over the world. something even close to yoga with adriene is something i haven‚Äôt found yet in my local yoga community. i love the intention, the way adriene lets you know ‚Äúi got you,‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got this,‚Äù you‚Äôre strong,‚Äù ‚Äúfind what feels good,‚Äù ‚Äúfrom your center,‚Äù is such a reminder that yoga is so much more than asanas. you have somehow found a way to put the foundations into each and every video, and i believe that is why your videos are so helpful and hit home (üòâ) for so many people.

I was watching Beyonce's homecoming performance on Netflix and I enjoyed the achievement more because she worked so hard to get her strength and stamina back after having twins.

I started this journey crying at the end of the first video (for the first time after a  yoga video) I ended this journey crying at the beginning and the end of this video. Today I read your mail and I already started tearing up. Then I started this practice and I just started crying. So in tradition I just showed up with what I had going on and started to find what feels good. So for the first few minutes just sat there crying. And the tension that I've been having in my shoulders the last few days just disappeared. Usually I get this pain in my throat, this lump in my throat so big that I almost can't breath. This time I felt my throat a little for just a second and then it was already gone. So eventually I started the slowly move and begin my practice. During this practice I begin too feel so light. This last few weeks feel like I have been digging deep in some old pains and have been processing them. It has been tough but also needed. At the end I thought, I did it and just felt so grateful. So the tears came again. And while laying there I heard you voice Adriene so strong saying, you are loved and you are worthy. And I truly felt it in my heart and soul. So you guessed it I started crying even more. So thank you so much Adriene for this Home journey and helping me process this old pains. I'm forever grateful, Namaste",UgyW_fYjwtpyItNdyyp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-02-02T10:44:13Z,0.9964779019355774

I‚Äôm so glad that I stuck with it, though! The 40 minutes flew by and there was something so serene and mindful about just doing the practice to music and focusing more on the movements and how they felt.

And it was one of the most amazing experiences. I came to the mat every single day, despite the challenges life throws at us. I came to the mat at 3 am and at 11:00 pm. I had days where it seemed too hard, and days where it felt effortless. It thought me to trust myself, to listen to what my body needs and wants, to feel that elusive self-love, to let go of negativity and toxic anxiety, to relax my shoulders, and to breath.

I practised every day of this challenge even if I had to stay up till midnight to do it, even when i felt super tired and then yesterday, on the last day, the most important day, i had a stomach bug and was simply bed-ridden. Absolutely gutted that for the first time i could't finish on time but it was all worth it when i finished it today, every second of it.

A huge Thank You for all the Yoga journey! It makes me feel better in many ways :)
There is also two small things I would consider to change in the future.
One thing is: when you turn to the camera when doing the first side, then I have to turn away from the screen to do the same move. Sometimes I tried to do opposite side first, but that's confusing for me. So for me it would be easier to follow, if you did the other side first, so I could watch it while I'm doing it.
The other thing is really not that important and personal preference. I kept wondering why you chose to show us your pretty butt in close up every single day in the intro. For me it seems to private and a little inapropriate for the seriously good yoga you are doing.

3835.0,"31 days ago I decided to follow the HOME journey (now fondly known to me as Yoga with Adriene with Adrienne). I've never done one of these month long journeys, and never really committed to something like this before, not fully anyway. But I figured, why not? Some mornings I didn't want to get up, but I did. Other mornings, I was up before my alarm. Some days, I had company next to me on the mat and others it was just me. Some days (especially this week), I came home and turned to another video just to help me decompress from a tough day. But, every day, I did it. I don't normally post comments, but these 30 days have meant something more to me - they have shown me what I can do and what I want to do - and I couldn't miss the opportunity to thank you for this video, for this series, and for this opportunity to challenge myself and truly commit to something.

Adriene, you are healing the world, one person at a time. So much is wrong with the age we live in, yet here you are, guiding us through the impossible.

I thank you for taking your time and putting heart and soul into these yoga practices. Every day I relearned to love myself a little more and be less harsh towards myself. At the beginning of this 30th day practice I sat down on the mat and cried. I couldn't believe it. In that moment I couldn't quite believe how quickly those 30 days actually passed by and how I did the daily practice EVERY DAY. But it really scares me how quickly time flies by.

The peace that I have found on the mat this last month has carried into my life in so many ways, this practice continually brought me back to myself, and nurtured joy and strength within me.

This month I was not perfect; I fell, I hurt, I griped, I cried. But like so many others here, I showed up every day, and I grew...stronger, braver, happier.

In this session I melted away years of self doubt and limiting beliefs that I can't do anything on my own, or I'm not good enough. In the middle of this session I started rocking some crow pose because I got so excited that my toes left the ground last time. I go in for my second round of toes off the ground, and *POP* I had a split second of panic before I realized I wasn't in pain. I had popped a significant portion of a calcium deposit on my left wrist. I mean, this thing was at least an inch round and I thought for sure I would need surgery to come close to fixing this problem. It's been on my wrist for 7 years now, and has caused me tension all the way up into my shoulders. Seven years. And it popped during my journey home. That's no coincidence.

3930.0,"I live in a motorhome (bus).  We travel from Ontario, where we live in the summer to Nanaimo, BC, where we stay in the winter.  I joined the gym last year when we were here, to stay in shape and weight train to keep myself strong for our handicapped 66 pound dog who we have to lift in and out of our motorhome.  Last summer, we spent so much money on having some of her bad teeth removed and so many other things that in our budget, (we are retired) I couldn't justify spending the money to rejoin the gym.  It rains here, a lot.  I saw a pop up shed on sale here recently, made of tarp material and steel poles that I asked my husband to buy me as an early birthday gift.  My birthday is in July.  I popped it up beside the bus, lined the floor with a tarp, put some jigsaw mats in it and voila.... Yoga hut!  Every day I've been going out to the little She Shed and doing 2 sets of 10 pound dumbell lifts, 2 sets of 50 squats, a plank that I increase every day by one second (I'm up to 2:17) with your January daily yoga session in the middle.  It's me time, it's glorious and I'm proud to have done it every day except for two snow days.  Thank you so much for all you do here.  You and Benji and that lovely calming voice, with the twinge of humour and the creak in the floor.  I've loved every second.

3935.0,"This was the best way of ending this ride Home. I struggle with inconstancy so much, that this 30 day experience was in the beginning a way of proving myself that I could finish something. But little did I know that this would not become into another to-do list, but into a new way of living, a new way of exploring myself and my body. Every day I noticed an improvement and discovered new things (at the beginning I couldn't even do downward facing dog properly, or reach the ground without bending my knees a lot in forward fold). Today I let myself explore and do quite a lot of ""freestyle"", and it felt so amazing and liberating. As you say ""trust me, trust yourself, trust the practice"".

This was really emotional for me. Particularly hearing the music that served as the themes for the previous years of the 30 Days of Yoga. It really struck me - more than usual - how long I've been practicing with you as a guide, Adriene. It may sound silly, but you are someone I ""see"" every day, and I appreciate that time so much. And it must be an exhausting endeavor to be the person that literally millions of people see every day. This series especially was a reminder of that, and I can't express my gratitude enough for the work that you have done and continue to do.

But I'm not crying or emotional- I have to say the silent thing doesn't work for me as well- it's not because I don't trust myself or my body it's because I can't remember what is next, or when to inhale or exhale, or what to pay attention to in each pose, and you'd think I would remember, but I don't, so I like to be reminded- my brain was working harder w/ the silent thing- and then the ""go slow"" but I'm slower at times than Adrienne was or faster, or distracted by trying to look at the screen to see what's next, and I totally miss the verbal cues and Adrienne's silliness too.

I missed Adriene's comforting voice, but it was interesting to see what I was able to do on my own. It was not perfect. I may just be having an off day; or maybe the independence of the practice scared me; or maybe the marinara sauce from dinner is making me feel sick. I struggled more than I wish I had. 
This made me doubt myself, but then I remember how difficult the first day was. The way my forearms shook and the sweat that coated my body. I also remember how proud I was that I did a whole 40 mins of yoga, and how excited I was to start this journey.


And I now realize that the journey Home has only just begun. I've gotten my feet wet; I'm slowly making my way into the water. This journey has been so eye opening. I've learned how much strength I actually hold. I've been more loving and accepting to myself. I've found a new nightly tradition to that helps me got to sleep; sometimes the yoga makes me feel better than I do all day long. I've grown a better understanding and appreciation for yoga.

4034.0,Wow this practice was amazing. I thought that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do today‚Äôs practice without you to guide me but boy was I wrong! I surprised myself in how much I learned and remembered from the last thirty days and with he fact that I went the whole forty minutes without feeling like I need to take a break for mental or physical reasons. This whole month has been one beautiful practice after the next. I hope in the months to come I can continue on my journey on and off the mat. This month I was able to do my first (and second and third) crow pose which felt amazing! I thought I would never be able to do it because I have so little upper body strength but I proved myself wrong and now I feel like I can (and will) do more and more balance poses in the future.

The first 20 min I was in my zone, I did what I felt was right and it felt right. I found home. Then I was lost hahaha but you were here with me and I found my way again. It was a beautiful experience and I hope to be in this journey with you for a long time.

When I started 30 days ago, I was depressed and battling the existential crisis. Nothing helped me, you name it - movement, books, spiritual tools, meditation, even sun, and healthy food. Through this process, I realized why it was like that. ""I"" was not there, I was not committed to healing at all, cause I had no idea who this ""I"" was. I loved the dark as it was comfortable, paradoxically warm, safe. And then I committed and fully surrendered to my own healing. And MAGIC happened. 30 days later and here I am, suddenly enjoying life and light again. All of a sudden I decluttered my whole apartment, bought a lot of houseplants and started creating my own urban jungle. And please mind this, I was not interested in plants al all my life. I do not know what exactly happened and I have no words. Dear Adriene and every each and one of you, I love you for being my humble guides home. Thank you, I am forever grateful.

4126.0,"I've been saving my comment until I completed all thirty days. I have started and failed to finish three of your past 30 day challenges Adriene and this year I decided, and worked hard to make sure that did not happen. I've gotten up earlier; I've been late for work; I've done yoga with my nephew crawling into my lap and between my legs in down dog üòÖ; I've done it in the evening if I woke up too late. I printed the calendar and everyday I did a little celebration dance as I filled in the day with a pattern to mark it as complete. 

Over the past month, yoga has  been a calming space, a catalyst for change, a push to get started and a challenge. I've had so many emotions over the course of this journey from clearing my head of anything that is bothering me to allowing myself to think through things I've have been putting off. I appreciate your channel so much and today after thirty days of doing yoga consistently, it was so reassuring to peek up and see that I was in Warrior 2 with you. I crafted the first thirty minutes on my own but followed along for the last ten. I made sure to work in a power pose and a goddess pose because honestly, that's how I feel after completing this challenge üë∏üèæü¶∏üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è#superpowerfulgoddessyogi.

As I said to myself after, I say to you here: May you be well, May you be happy, and may you be loved. 
With love and kindness, Nathan Gilles From Missouri. <3

Adriene, I can't thank you (and your team!) enough for how much time, effort, energy and love you've put into this. I am so grateful. You've already single-handedly changed my 2020.

4161.0,"Hi Adriene! Hi everybody! 

 I've been struggling with anorexia for quite some time now. Last year, I embarked on this 30 days yoga journey and managed to keep up with yoga for half a year before I had to focus on intense recovery from my mental illness. I spend the last six months of 2019 eating well and not moving any muscle, for fear that exercise will trigger weight loss thoughts. I ended that year with a body that was stronger and healthier, but with mind that was torn between further recovery and self hatred. 

This year I embarked on this journey once more. Excercise is still scary, especially the community associated with it, but yoga with you is like a warm, safe space. As you say we don't do yoga, we practice it. There are no goals, only intentions. Every time I step on my mat, my intention is to be happy and hopeful again. Today at the end of the practice I thought, maybe for the first time in years, that I'm grateful for my body that is capable and strong and can move and do such amazing things. It was a revolutionary thought to say the least! 

I hope yoga with you will remain a big part of a happy, hopeful life ahead of me. I'm truly thankful for you, more thankful than I can say. The feeling of self acceptance I felt today was one of the most beautiful moments in my life.",UgzJ_e0fbcqdug54sXx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-31T23:45:59Z,0.9995194673538208

I was scared to go in without the instructions ... i fell few time and had to go backward in the video 3 times ... it wasnt perfect but i went through it and it was mine.
I can't believe i achieved this, Adriene i will never thank you enough for what you gave me and i want to commit to that. I deserve to feel good and i owe it to myself. 

Thank you so much ... I love you :') ‚ù§",Ugwc_f733URBHFdholJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-31T23:14:48Z,0.9867144227027893

I usually practised yoga only when i had a really tough time and it sure helped, but now i feel empowered to practise yoga more often, as a way to reward myself both in good and bad. Thank you for sharing this experience with me Adriene, thanks for making all this possible. Altough this practise was non guided, I could still hear your voice in my head telling me to breathe in and out and taking things slowly. Big up to everyone who has been here since this beautiful joruney started, it's not always easy to fulfill a challenge especially if it's an everydat challenge, I believe this is the first time i've stayed true to myself and completed a challenge that i do find joy and peace in.

I'm a beginner and enjoyed most of the 30 sessions, but doubting the whole thing now because that might just not be my style of Yoga at all if this is what we were aiming for.

4250.0,"Hi, first time in the comment section :) I first came across this when someone shared it in a discord server I am in. At first I was sceptical to it, like ""me, do yoga? naaah"" but I decided to give it a chance. was still a bit sceptical in the beginning but stuck through it, even if I looked completely ridicilous :D And this 30 day journey has been the most special thing to me so far in 2020. Every day after finishing, I have always felt at peace and genuinely happy, which is a rare thing. It's as if every bad depressive thoughts, any worries, everything just dissappeared for a good while. Also knowing that everyday that you, Benji and everyone else out there was here doing the same thing, it was reassuring in a way. I teared up a few time while writing this, there where both sad and happy tears. This has been the most amazing journey I have ever had, it showed me that change is possible, and what we all have within is very special and stronger than we think, and that it is just as or more important than what is on the outside. I am for sure gonna continue with yoga after this :D So, thank you Adriene, Benji, behind the scene people, everyone else here for this very special experience, for showing me that all needed to change is within oneself. And I hope you all continue to have a blessed and beautiful 2020, I'm sending all the love from Norway <3 Namaste",UgyEbYgN9JnfFjARCYF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-31T22:25:41Z,0.996968686580658

And always when I arrived at day 8, everything in my life started going crazy, and eventually I had to stop. So, last year I gave up. This time around everything Was going perfectly fine... Until sunday!!! I caught up a respiratory infection, and had 40‚Ä¢C of fever for 3 days. Had to go to the hospital and everything. My first impulse was giving up again. And it made me sad. So... on wednesday, thursday and today, I did two days in each ( one in the morning, and another in the evening) and I FEEL GREAT, because that way I could come HOME with all of you. And most important of all: I chose NOT to quit.

However towards the end I discovered that I wouldn't find what i seek here, today I was proven wrong. I found it, I found Home. I found myself. I dug deep, so very deep in this silent practice that I finally found the childhood trauma that was blocking me from becoming who I truly am. The source that started this cycle of fear and desire to be accepted by others, and to conform. Now I feel free, and I have you Adrienne, mg dear teacher, to thank for it.

THANK YOU so much for such an amazing journey. Thank you for taking your time to prepare it all for us. It's been such an honour to be a part of it.
I couldn't stop crying while reading the very last email. And then, when I started the practice, I needed a few minutes to calm down. I found the stillness, it's a big achievement for me since I struggled for three weeks. I kept telling myself ""you did so well"".
I'll be honest. My body was very well prepared this time, I've exercised enough for the past few months. It was my mind that struggled the most. I knew it would be tough and challenging. Many thing happened last year and I was running away from thinking. I thought I was doing well distracting myself but all of these sessions made me realise that I can't avoid it. That's why it's been such an emotional journey. I though I wouldn't write it down but I think I can. It was my first time doing yoga since I stopped taking antidepressants. My emotions were all there, no help, just me and them. It's such a relief I was able to do it. I'm so grateful for the guidance.
I thought I would need a few days off but I might be back tomorrow, I feel like doing it. Let's see what happens.
I read many comments and people are so brave for showing up when it hurts the most, it's so inspiring. It made this journey even better. It's incredible.

4380.0,"I have to say this was my favourite practise of the month, for many reasons. Primarily, it showed me the ability I have to put together the vocabulary I have learned in a meaningful way. 
I was able to give my body exactly what I needed. Before I started, I saw the practise was 40 minutes long, and I was worried about being able to create enough flow on my own for that long. I did use Adriene as a reference a couple of times, but I typically practise with my eyes closed unless I am really confused. I found myself near the end hoping there would be enough time left to fit everything in that I still had in my head. 
I cried through the first almost 10 minutes, then a couple more times throughout. It hit me because I have been going to the same yoga class (my first and only studio thus far) with the same guide for over 2 years now, and this week we found out that at the end of February, she is moving, therefore this is our last session of yoga with her. There are so many emotions attached for me because I joined this class two months after moving to the country to live with my fiance, and I was worried I would become lonely and isolated. This class gave me somewhere to go that I felt like I belonged, and I built some beautiful kinship in this class. 
I do know that I am lucky enough to work in a city nearby-ish and will be ale to pick up classes there. This just hit me so hard because it is the end of HOME and nearing the end of the last session of yoga with my first ever studio and group. 
I am grateful there are more YWA videos and more yoga studios to join.

This time I was like I can do this and I peeked over to you a lot to stay with you and I realized that it‚Äôs special because this is the time when you are really doing yoga fully with us and not having to talk in between breathing. So it‚Äôs a beautiful time to share together side by side. And some times I peeked over and you were smiling and that made me smile too! Thank you so very much!!

""Here you can a little vinyasa, cobra, or straight to downward dog."" 
""Hug the lower abs in. You are strong.""

""Get back to your breath."" 
""Hands together at the heart.""

I discovered this channel four or five years ago, which was probably my first attempt at one of the 30-day journeys, and I think I've started each January since with an attempt to complete one, but something always got in the way. Not this time! It's amazing how good it feels just to know I have it in me to follow all the way through, not to mention the physical and psychological warmth that comes along with daily practice :) 


I'm grateful to myself for managing to show up, even when it was rough, and for being kind myself on the days when I couldn't give 100%. I'm grateful for this community for being a bright spot every morning reminding me of what we have been sharing here, the love and joy and healing power of movement together. And I'm so so so grateful to you, Adriene, for making it all possible--no one could ask for a better guide on this journey. 


My cat is sitting beside me purring meaningfully so guess I should also include her in here for being a constant presence along the way to remind me not to take myself too seriously ^.^ this one's for you Maiz.

Lessons I've learned that I want to thank Adriene for: I don't need to rush into a difficult posture - I just need to revisit it daily and before I even know it, I'll be comfortable and happy there; my days are best when I visit yoga in the morning before work rather than in the evening; I can find my own best practice while still having a guide to be there with me.

4735.0,"I just wanted to say thank you, Adrienne. Your commitment to sharing the beauty of your practice is commendable. 
I have always wanted to be able to fit yoga into my routine because I have been rendered very inflexible from four years of lifting with little to no mobility routine. 
But I live on a military base in the desert, so needless to say the accessibility of a yoga class is... absent. 
That being said I had tried previous practices on youtube but yours was the only one to stick!
With this new year, I finally said to myself I'm going to do this every day, and this journey has been exactly what I needed.
Thank you again!


IF I COULD IMPART SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM THOUGH:
I can't complain about any of the other days but to be frank, this finale was a huge let down for me. Without the audial guided talking us through movements, I found myself constantly cranking my neck in every position to make sure I didn't miss a change or I didn't check enough and was left way behind. Not to mention that all that distraction made it very hard for me to maintain my conscious breathing. All in all, it made me feel very discouraged because I refused to quit. But I just couldn't handle this tempo as a beginner with no audial guide...
I know it is tradition to get rid of mic for last day I just figured you were owed some food for thought :)

I could finally feel the sorrow and unloved-ness that was in there, stored. Today the feeling vould come up and I cried all the way to the end of the practice (and finished it fully meanwhile!). I was crying not because of the pain but because now love started to pour in where there was pain before. This is true healing.

Seemed fitting that the last day of Home,  I finished  in the hotel room on the last stop until our destination. This was my first challenge and I will start a previous year tomorrow. 
The last practice was beautiful and was a full well rounded yoga session. I liked the music, but with a person with some neck issues, I did miss the instructions. Haha, I did your neck and shoulder practice right after. 
I would love if you had another day  30 with your voice guidance since it was so beautiful and full of all the yoga positions that we had practiced the last month.

4755.0,"This has been the most amazing 30 day challenge I have ever done.  Usually my challenges, or goals that I set around fitness, have been centered around things like running a marathon, biking 150 miles and enduring some kind of pain or burn out.  This challenge has been all about learning to listen to my body and giving myself permission to take a break if needed.  I have taken the skills that I learned off the mat into my daily life and have not looked to be perfect but rather to take time to listen to what I need.  As a mother, wife, and survivor of abuse I have not put much stock into my needs and tend to ""stuff it down"" to the point where there is no more room for stuffing.  I plan to repeat this entire 30 days and continue to learn how to  listen to my needs and nourish my body and soul.

4773.0,"The concept of ""finding what feels good"" and ""leaving the rest"" really comforts me. It's like permission to be yourself with no need to fit a square peg in a round hole. I started YWA last year around this time. I alternated between the same 2 beginner videos for about two months straight. I didn't think I was ""ready"" for a 30 day series. The first series I did was the Dedicate series. It took me around 40 days to complete it. I did the Dedicate series again and this time it took something like 50 days. A lot was going on in my life. I found myself a stranger in a new home. So, then I started the True series. The first time around was about 35 days and the second time doing True was about 32. How long it takes doesn't matter, what is important is how I gripped on to those series during a difficult time in my life. I had a roof over my head but I was never home until I was on the mat. So you can see, as the beginning of Home approached, I felt an intense closeness to it. The mat, my head, my breathing, these are where Home lies within me. Here I am, 30 days in 30 days. It's a small accomplishment in this vast world of yoga but I am so grateful to you, Adriene. You didn't buy me a house but you taught me a Home. Thank you.

I'm new to yoga and thought that there was no way I could get through 40 minutes without following every move as perfectly as possible. Then I surrendered. I followed when I could, caught up when I could, did what I could--trusted myself. I was surprised to see the comments about people getting emotional at the end.

Have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of nowhere?
Have you ever felt like you could disappear?
Like you could fall, and no one would hear?


Well, let that lonely feeling wash away
Maybe there's a reason to believe you'll be okay
'Cause when you don't feel strong enough to stand
You can reach, reach out your hand


And oh, someone will coming running
And I know, they'll take you HOME
Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
And when you're broken on the ground
You will be found


So let the sun come streaming in
'Cause you'll reach up and you'll rise again
Lift your head and look around
You will be found


-You will be found, dear evan hansen


I was listening to this wonderful song fro my favorite musical as I heard the keyword ""home"" and I had to think right away at this journey. I just needed to share, cause I totally feel like this describes exactly whas hapened with me this month. I let the sun streaming in and reached out my hand, and yes, I was found.

And first of all, I can tell you, dear soul, these pals truly love you. :) Besides all these delicate and precious love notes, it seems that there is not much left to add. I have chosen this segment of 'Great Dictator‚Äôs' speech:
‚ÄúWe have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.
Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical.
Our cleverness, hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little.
More than machinery, we need humanity.
More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities, life will be violent, and all will be lost.‚Äù
I can also tell that there is one rare contemporary social phenomenon that keeps these precious qualities still running in human beings. That and much more... Don‚Äôt you think? ;)

Second time i Sticked with the daily practice into June so i learned that if you make yoga and health a priority, it is pretty easy to stick to it as it so quickly becomes a habit and even if on some days you only squeeze five minutes of practice in, all of them count towards a better mind and body!
This time around i learned to let go and be more okay with it If a posture does not feel well and listen to my body when something is too intense.

5062.0,"Thank you so much again for these past 30 days Adriene. Every year during the last practice, when the music from the other 30 days are playing I think back to where I was when I started doing yoga, and all the years since. The first year I did the 30 days in realtime in January was in 2017. I was doing fieldwork abroad in a country where people were very reserved, and had just celebrated Christmas and NYE all alone. The start of the 30 days marked the end of that fieldwork and of being lonely, with my family coming to visit me and traveling with them. I didn't know it at the time, but it would also be the last time traveling with both my parents together, because by the next 30 days in 2018, they were mid-divorce. It was a sad time, but also full of surprises. I had moved back home temporarily after my fieldwork of the year before, and because of the divorce I had to find an apartment. The first day of the 30 days that year, January 2nd, I got the news that I got an apartment. I felt like I was rescued, although that apartment never really started to feel like home. By last year's 30 days, I had just submitted my master thesis, and my defense was during that month. I finally obtained my masters degree and finished university forever. What I didn't know was that I would be here, this year, in a new city in a new country, as a PhD student at a new university and in an apartment that finally feels like home. Although I am far away from my family, my apartment feels like it's mine, and like I belong. That is why this year's theme is so beautifully fitting for my situation. And today is also the day that my sister comes to visit me, so family is not always that far away after all. Again, thank you Adriene for organising this beautiful journey for us every year. As during all the past 30 days, I learned a lot about myself, I laughed and I cried, but this year those were mostly years of happiness and joy.",UgwsAeE2igjeDqEXJiN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-31T08:38:57Z,0.998123824596405

5083.0,This has been a beautiful 29 days. But I really struggle with these 'no mike' sessions! End up getting upset as I end up with a crick in the neck trying to follow the routine. Can't concentrate on the yoga. Think I'll do one of the other sessions! Perhaps we need less talk but just talk to guide - I close my eyes so much when I'm doing yoga.

I listened to my body and it felt out what I needed. Was super cool to check with Adriene and Benji as he came to get some TLC. You were cuddling him for all of us Adriene. Did a few extra warrior 3's and did my own variation of deep yoga squat with cactus arms in my knees and starfish hands (not sure what to call that variation but it FG) also did some boat dips and some extended legs twists (lit that üî• in the tummy). Was in the cuctus armed squat and looked over and saw Adriene doing the boat dips I was rooting her on then she looked at the camera as if she could hear me haha #magic. Then Benji came back for his own downward dog I had to watch him for a second all cute and stuff hehe hope whatever time you do this home session that you enjoy it and love doing it. 

I had my Bambi pj's on and was rocking it out. Let's continue the journey home! In bocca al lupo  (Good luck in italiano)

5147.0,"Thank you Adriene, and thank you everyone who breathed and sweated together with me. Those last 30 days were very hard for me with a 5-year long relationship that ended and the emotional and organizational turmoil that followed. The word 'home' was difficult because my old flat felt hostile and sad, my friend's place where I stayed felt foreign and empty. But whenever I stepped on the mat, I felt home. I let go of which was no longer serving me and even if it was dreadfully painful I knew it was right and this journey had my back all along. Tomorrow I move into my new apartment and I am just overflowing with thankfulness. You are all amazing and I felt your heartbeats with mine every time I bowed in the end.

5158.0,"Looking forward to doing this practice a few days later than planned. 
I got really overwhelmed about a week ago trying to keep up with the daily practice and i noticed my body and mind growing resentful of it.  It started to feel like any other chore. What threw me off completely, was that it the practice wasn't as helpful as it used to be (f.e. the 30 day yoga journey one year ago)... i just couldn't seem to shut my mind up. I know this sounds like a cheap excuse but there was just too much on my plate.. or is at the Moment.
So i started skipping days. I still plan on doing every video in this journey, simply not by its assigned day.¬†
Because I'm not giving up and I haven't failed just because I adjusted my tempo.... daily yoga is the most beneficial, but know there is still value in doing these practices on my own timeline. Now i just have to let go of my nagging guilt, that i didn¬¥t do what i set out to do.¬†

The 30 day challenges always get my year off to a good start. You‚Äôve helped me to create a real daily yoga routine.

5206.0,"Adriene, I have a travel day today but hope to complete day 30 from a hotel room in Dublin later. I just wanted to thank you for this experience. I have surprised myself, firstly for getting up at 6am every morning to come to the mat (unheard of) but also by how this has made me feel - I haven't always been able to complete everything but I've had a good shot and it's made me feel much better in body and mind and not just during practice, for the whole of the rest of the day. I am definitely going to continue and have subscribed now to FWFG. Your calm, encouraging manner is so important and your love for yoga shines through. I have enjoyed the 'community' feel too even though I haven't met any of you - I've loved finding out how everyone else is getting on! I am not one bit surprised that you have exceeded 6 million subscribers - you are very good at what you do and you are making a huge difference by offering this gift of free yoga to people across the globe - it's amazing! And then there's Benji who is adorable too. Anyway, thank you again Adriene and namaste xxüòçüôèüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",Ugxe3iWngQtmsihdDah4AaABAg,2.0,0.0,2020-01-31T06:10:30Z,0.9996840953826904
