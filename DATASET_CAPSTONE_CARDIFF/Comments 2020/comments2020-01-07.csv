2.0,I comment every day to share what I'm feeling and what practice brought up. Today I just don't want to. I got irrationally frustrated when I lost my balance and I knew it was because it was just another place in my life where I wasn't in control. I'll explore this frustration later.

Just wanted to let you know this:

I started this journey as a challenge to myself. As a 'come on, get off your ass, you don't even need to choose a video everyday cause they're handed to you on a silver platter' kind of thing.

In other words, I was going to 'force' myself to pull through. Now on day 7 I realized that it has already started to become something I look forward to, am grateful for and enjoy.

And the times just flies by so quickly with you, I notice myself really enjoying your humour and your spirit by now and talking to my tablet (aka you). It puts energy in my body and a smile on my face everyday and I am so grateful.

Can't wait to keep it up tomorrow! Thank you so much for sharing this with us for free - I usually have such a hard time sticking to things but you make it easy. Namaste!",Ugx-f6N13ZFJW-IYrXB4AaABAg,0.0,9.0,2021-02-11T19:33:36Z,0.9995871186256409

196.0,"Adrienne-This stretch practice was fantastic for me this morning.  I have low back pain and right hip pain which started at the beginning of February and it is now almost October!  Your various different practices are so easy to follow and find what works personally on any given day.  I especially likes the attention to breath and ""old school"" gym stretch (which I think you referred to it as), wide legs, arms stretched to opposite feet.  The number of those was really good.  The ballerina pose was a gauge for me.  I practice weekly and normally can reach a good stretch with a long hold.  I could not get there on the right side.  Love your sessions with uplifting beautiful plants, (Ive noticed how they have grown over time) AND of course the cute and loving Benji.  I always wonder do you go jogging with Benji just before filming?  He is so calm and seems to relish the relax and refresh as we all do.

As my weekly local lesson had to stop because of the lockdown I needed some other way of getting me on the mat. Now that my working day is also home based & therefore computer based (I'm a catering college teacher so used to walking around a LOT!) I find I need something to keep me relaxed both mentally & physically but also keep the muscles toned. As an enthusiastic gardener with both my own garden and a large community garden my back often needs a little extra help as well. This was actually how I found you, looking for relief for lower back pain. I am now doing a daily session with you (no longer traveling to work gives me the extra time;-)!) and find it energizes and helps my back, am also maybe even starting to find I have some Abs;!

Just stick to it you don't have to be perfect just do it in the best way you can.,UgwiFiDc0d2iaDxdZa54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-25T18:46:47Z,0.9997661709785461

I also suffer from chronic migraines that only affect my right side, and seem to throb all the way from my shoulder up through my eye. I usually roll around on a tennis ball when it's really bothering me. Today, doing the alternating toe touches, I could really feel a sharp pain in my mid back around the bottom of my scapula; the pain felt close to the spine. I only felt it when I was bending to touch my right does, and it was on the right side of my back. Would that be a rib out of place, or something else??

545.0,"Thank you for these videos, Miss Adorable Adriene! ❤️ The 'food for thought' of breath being spirit is super interesting!! And, for any Christians out there, it's biblical too!  When the Hebrew scriptures uses the word 'spirit' it is translated in English as 'breath'!  The book of Genesis specifically records that when God created Adam and Eve, He created them in His image, meaning that He created them to be spiritually alive.  He breathed within them the ""breath of life"" and that is what gave them 'spirit' or 'life.'  In fact, the construction for those words “the breath of life” is the Nishmat chaim; which is a specific construction for the very Holy Spirit of God. (I learned that from a renowned Hebrew scholar.) 😃😁☺️",Ugw5bF1WSAj0rYv-1JJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-22T16:32:19Z,0.9988341927528381

After each session I would feel amazing and it really helped me pull myself together in a hard time in my life. However, at some point after that 30 days I fell out of my schedule of doing yoga everyday and I have been trying to get back into it. I know it is easier to take time to do yoga while I'm inside the home all day because of the virus, but I hope when(if) this is all over, I can continue to practice daily. I always recommend everyone to start doing yoga if they want a positive change in their life, because I feel that yoga gives me the strength to do more.  Also, the balance practices are my favorite!

665.0,"The quarantine caused school to convert to online education. The instructors assigned overwhelming amounts of homework to make up for missed class time. The stress from having extra assignments, more deadlines, confining at home, and feeling purposeless has caused me to feel very depressed and fatigued. This morning, I woke up at 6AM to study for an exam tomorrow, and a sense of hopelessness overcame me. The exam was set to be 45 mins for 60 questions, when normally, we are allotted 1.5 hours for 60 questions. This was done so students cannot cheat, but it also leaves very little time to read and answer the questions thoroughly, thus adding to the already-overwhelming levels of stress. I did three videos in a row, day 5, 6, and 7. Adriene's voice was very soothing, constantly reminding me to breath and be myself. I cannot be perfect, I cannot meet everyone's expectation, it's okay if I don't do well on the exam that is worth 25% of the grade, I can do the class over again if I fail, it's not the end of the world, and I will be okay.

For me, this journey is all about self care, being only with myself and my thoughts during these 30 minutes, and coming out of it feeling connected and relaxed. 
Today, I kept being interrupted during my practice. I got frustrated and broke down crying. The thing is, had I not been on this journey with you, Adriene, I would've stopped and not done this practice today. Instead, I paused the video, sat down, closed my eyes and just breathed. After 5 minutes I got up and started over. I'm proud of myself for not giving up today and persisting on just being with myself today for these 30 minutes.

678.0,"I had a pretty different experience to what I've read in the comment tbh. I don't think it's uncommon but I know it's normally something people find in the physically harder videos. I was fully in the attitude to get zen and stretch as I started the practice but about 10 minutes in I found myself getting super frustrated. 
I realized it was because the moves were less physically challenging so I was thinking more about my mental headspace rather than 'ow this really hurts. I hope she says we're moving into a new pose soon' lol. And all that focus on mind just brought out all these negative feelings I reckon I was burying even from myself or at least from the forefront of my consciousness. 
It was definitely a new sensation for me to be pushing through that mental distress (rather than the physical one we're usually in) to overcome it and not quit on the practice.

Today as I did this star pose, I felt my body become fluid, and the breath gently rocking my upper body like a small boat on the ocean, as my arms reached up to the sun. It felt so sweet and unexpected it made me laugh.

I am late 30s, super inflexible (touching toes is a challenge and downward dog is almost a crouch!) -  I have a bump on my spine if you run your hand down it - I notice that when I do spinal rolls there is a kind of bump in the roll as - my lumbar spine to my hips - my spine doesn’t bend forward, so it is just straight while the rest of my back bends. I can do it nearly smoothly if I concentrate quite hard. Does anyone have any idea what this means or is? Is it common? 
Could it relate to the bump (which an Alexander technique trainee told me once was an injury but which my mum a physio disagreed with and just said it’s just a difference in my back)? Is it learnt because I stick my bum out as a habit, connected to poor posture, so those muscles are tight?

Haven't had much luck with my practice these last few days, after repeating day six I was so excited to see stretch for day seven. Flexibility is my enemy so I know I needed this. Not even five minutes in I started to experience effects of a medical issue and tried to push through the practice but it just became too distracting.

When I do yoga and I compress myself or twist, if my body has changed or gotten smaller, even just a little, I can tell by how it feels in the pose and in yoga. No other exercise allows me to be this aware of my form and it helps motivate me on days when my belly gets in the way, and gives me a sense of accomplishment on days when I realize I can move more easily because my body is changing.

1237.0,"Day 7 was particularly difficult for me. My arches are very high due to CMT muscular dystrophy and my calves weak, so balancing is difficult.  CMTers have a tendency to lose balance and fall, or trip over their own feet and fall. Hard to ground all 4 corners of the feet with high arches. I practiced  yoga when I was  younger and learned to balance. I am 61 and hope to do so again. I am happy there is an Adriene  with a HOME practice for all of us!       ***  Much Love!  ***",UgxiK6F25stttqD8dOJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-09T19:06:03Z,0.9934437274932861

1253.0,"First day I've handled my time well enough to join in a practice BEFORE work! A MILESTONE!! Am joining in from Oakland, CA.

With great respect for you, Adriene, I know many people do not realize the reality of the spirit and the soul, but since you emphasized both during the practice, I feel led to share that the ""spirit"" is the essence of the person; what makes YOU uniquely YOU and unduplicable, even if you are an identical twin. The ""soul"" is that eternal entity residing in each person that contains one's WILL. That WILL is either under the direction of the Lord GOD Almighty as He reveals Himself in the Bible or by default under the direction of satan. There is no in between. Each ""soul"" will be judged according to its walk here on earth in either deliberate and direct engagement with GOD according to HIS precepts, statutes and ways or by default remaining outside God's presence and guidance. Thus, I must push back on the notion of ""the soul or spirit or whatever you want to call it"". Falling to this seduction leaves the person without knowledge of who they really are and how they fit into the overall plan for both the Earth and the universe.",UgwAzH-_sffFS6taQft4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-09T16:00:54Z,-0.9728301167488098

This yoga journey connected both homes for me as I have done every practice each day. Today I was joined by my ferret Chauncey. It used to be my birds, but since one of my beloved birds passed away, I haven't been able to bring myself to let the other three join me, as it was Bengeltje who was the one who prompted the rest to come down from their cage and scurry around my mat. Still, it was fun to see Chauncey wonder why my mat felt like all of his toys and watch him jump around with me as I did my practice. He is on the older side so he ended up crawling back up into his hammock about halfway through and now he is fast asleep.

1432.0,i live in Australia and was introduced to Yoga with Adrienne by a lady who gave me a neck massag. That was about 6 months ago now and I have been practicing daily since. i love feeling into how I feel and then choosing a practice that matches.. Yoga for stress or yoga for digestion etc!! I'm really enjoying this 30 day practice.. I'm noticing how my balance is gradually improving! Today while practicing I had this thought' everything is energy' while  I was focussing on moving the energy up the front and down the backbody as we did a couple of days ago I think. I really appreciate the in depth description of each movement which helps to know that you are getting the movemnt correct for the best use of breath and energy.

They tend to be a bit more difficult to do, or at least you feel all the muscles, all the tension, all the work that's being made to feel the stretch, not just physically. It's super weird.

at the end, i felt some real space and grace in dancer. it's lovely how the experience shifts when you can tune into the guidance and movement of the breath. 

still feeling super-soft and vulnerable, even after a nap - but there's an undercurrent of love and gentleness there. I'm curious to see what tomorrow's HEAL practice will bring forth.

1656.0,Finally a slower soothing practice that allowed my sore muscles to recuperate. The expansion I get from stretching feeling wonderful. I was a bit in my head when I started but now feel more focused and centered.I love balancing poses to get my focused and aligned. I also have anterior pelvic tilt so I work to hug my stomach in at the ribs and straighten up the right way.  I also like how Adriene mentioned to change your energy if you have a slippery mat. That is what I use to do with my old slippery mat. One must pay extra attention not to slide too much.

The rotation behind is not good, I Sumer that continuous practice e will help free the muscles and loses them so I can actually lift my arms behind my back.

I asked my sweet non-yoga practicing Colombian husband if he wanted to join me for Day 5 the other day and he reluctantly agreed. We had many laughs during that practice, but afterwards he said he liked it and 'it was different.""

Then this morning to my surprise he ASKED me if he could join me again so we practiced Day 7 together in our living room with our 11 month old daughter next to us happily playing. It was such a sweet magical memorable moment that I will never forget. I wish I had taken a photo, but I just smiled and soaked it in. His job is pretty physical and afterwards over breakfast he said, ""it''s really nice to move my body in a different way than I normally do.

1715.0,"Every year I try to accomplish your start of year practice. Some years I am able to, some I am not. 

This year my chronic illness and I have come to an understanding so far and I have made it through this week! 

No matter what I practice yoga every day that I am able to get out of bed, it is often with you and I want you to know that you have yoga out there for everyone! 

Before becoming ill I was very advanced in my practice and you have space for that but after my illness, you provided plenty of videos that I could not only follow along with but find humor and another Texas girl who also dealt with an injury of her own. I'd often wake up Sunday morning to a video and think ""this is exactly what I need today!"". 

This is all to say that through the years you, your team, and the community have always been there for me as a go-to on YouTube, and I thank you so much for providing these gorgeous free videos along with your personality to everyone who needs a bit of get-up and go!
 
Hoped to be at Red Rocks this summer but missed the event due to illness, hopefully, another opportunity will present itself soon to share in this awesome community IRL! 

May this year bring you and the community ever more blessings and happiness!",Ugxct_68IzA0yGYkIW54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-08T14:59:55Z,0.999229907989502
