1.0,"I made an effort to leave my demons at the door during this practice. It seemed impossible but I tried to let myself be present and know that I can pick up worry and anxiety and struggle right where I left it. But I don't need those to do yoga. It showed me a bit about how I am not my demons. I am something separate, even if they hijack my life and my will, they are not me. Happy to be here, I do hope I am healing.",UgzWrWPLozWR3i7GAwN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-10T05:26:22Z,0.9964163303375244

14.0,"For me, there’s WAY too much talking in the videos. I don’t need a life coach I need a yoga instructor to instruct me. The workouts are great! But if you have any videos that are straight to the point yoga instructions I would totally be in. I understand that some people need reassurance and someone telling them “they can do it” but I don’t. I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m trashing you but I’m not I just don’t need all the extra, tell what to do and how long to do and what the next position is and let me focus on all the things I need to focus on.

40.0,"This one is going in my bookmarks bar. Something really clicked for me in this video. I think this is the first time I've ever entered a mediation as deeply as I did in the first part of this session. I lost myself to my breathing all while still somehow being present in and mindful of my body and I cannot tell you how much of a gift that is for me: Breathing and paying attention to my breath used to be incredibly panic-inducing for me so that I was able to do this is huge. And it was so healing. I started your videos a few months ago and I did breath in June and it was really difficult for me because of all the breathing (but nowhere near as bad as it has been, partially because of my place in my healing process and partially because of the way you handled it)...and while my relationship with my breath grew through that month, I never quite managed to experience what you spoke about with respect to your relationship to your breath. This isn't the first time in one of your videos where something has clicked in a particularly healing way-- usually, it happens when I don't really expect it to and I've cried, processed, and/or released something a few times--thank you for all of those moments but especially thank you for this one because it was more expected in this one and so I got to process it in this very cozy and nurturing place.",Ugzhe3yD0DnVeUzUWWt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-08-08T22:24:12Z,0.9932774901390076
41.0,"I have to share the craziest thing that has ever happened to me. 

When she said, ""Blanket yourself in love."", my awareness faded for a moment. I actually saw my 8 year old self sitting in my childhood room. Lost, lonely, crying. I walked up to her and wrapped the blanket around her. I told her it was okay and where we are today. How strong she was. Adrienne's voice in the background. 8 year old me heard her for a moment, looking up and around, eyes scattered. We made eye contact, boom, I was back. Tears streaming. 

Thank you Adrienne. I literally blanketed myself in love today. I think I traveled time and changed the past in some way. Never in a million years would I have imagined that something like this would happen after joining a 30 day yoga challenge at home.

Then Adriene told us to get cozy and I was in heaven. Being told to ""blanket myself with love"" put an invincible smile on my face that wouldn't go away. Adriene telling me she loved me nearly made me cry and whisper back ""I love you too"".

8 days. It's been 8 days, people. How has this become such a big part of my life and my personality so quickly? Well anyway, to say it with her words, I love it.

157.0,"At first, I did not understand how this yoga class could lead me to healing as it said in the title, nor did I think I ever needed healing. I came to the class looking forward to the stretches because it felt really good to get my body moving at really slow and guided pace. As I gave myself time to be still during this class, I realized that was the kind of healing that I needed - to be still and to surrender, to give myself *permission* to do absolutely nothing. I was always the steady kind of person and I always thought that it was wrong that I am this way, not as fast paced as everyone else in the world. It is one thing to be relaxed and steady and still but it is a different and beautiful thing to be consciously allowing yourself to be so. 

At first, I thought I was only breathing in and out like she said not knowing that that was what it was like to blanket myself, breathe in and breathe out love. When you asked me to notice how I feel and notice any changes in my breath, there were tears in my eyes - tears of love and gratitude. It's funny and comforting reading the comments that other people experience it too. As I was still on my back against the earth I caught myself saying thank you for allowing myself this time with you.

I like what you said about surrender. ""As we surrender to that which is bigger than us, there is a beautiful opportunity to recognize the surrender as actually a unity - an idea that we are part of that which is bigger than us."" It truly is beautiful and I'm excited to explore more of it with myself through your guidance! Thank you Adrienne! <3",UgwnP0PbLP-Q2sPuSZ94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-14T01:42:06Z,0.9994290471076965

I am actually never alone. I have my family, my friends and dozens of people all around the world who are rooting for me. But, must importantly, I have a purpose.

I wanted to check in with myself mentally and physically, and just overall ground myself. My mother had a stroke a month ago so I wanted to introduce her to yoga to alleviate stress, get her back in sync, and physically strengthen her. So far we are loving the home 30 days!  Day 8 reminded me to fully use and stretch my lungs. Yoga is about the FULL body, not just the muscles, but the organs as well. This has been the perfect ease back into the yoga world and it's everything I didn't realize I was missing.

342.0,"At the beginning of this journey I set the intention to be more aware of the choices I make, with some focus on how I make decisions when it comes to food and sustaining my body. Today I had chosen to keep this practice for later in the evening and do a more active practice during the day, but some part of me knew I was just going to skip day eight - I'm here to make conscious choices that are good for me, after all. Relaxing like this is not something my body deserves just yet. Need to lose some weight first. 

A sentiment I thought I had transcended, but something I need to keep bringing myself back to. It's so easy to lose your way sometimes.

As I'm writing this it's well past three in the morning, it's storming outside and the wind is literally howling, throwing itself at the house, has been all night, and earlier tonight some sort of restlessness crept up on me. I felt wide awake, in an almost jittery way. It's a feeling I'd normally numb with food, but the intention I have set actually works. Today I didn't feed myself things my body doesn't need, things my soul just craves for a lack of understanding what it does really need. But the amazing understanding, the choosing not to cave in to something habitual like that, doesn't mean the restlessness just goes away. 

Some sweet, soft voice in my head gently reminded me of the practice I had promised myself earlier today - a promise I very well knew had been empty. I was watching a series on my laptop, my love sleeping calmly in the room next to me. And without even second guessing it, I gave in. I finished the episode, prepped my yoga mat with all the blankets and pillows I was going to need to make this practice as comfortable and loving as possible. Then without any fussing I gave into it. 

I had my eyes closed for practically the entire session. I had noticed Adriene had let her hair down and did the same. Appreciating the way that felt. Feeling connected without the pinch of guilt or shame or whatever you'd like to call it, that, for me, normally comes with wanting to believe you're connected to someone who's just so far above you in so many ways. I felt like I was practicing with a dear friend today. I think I was a dear friend, my dear friend, today, too. And that feels incredibly nice.

Thank you, Adriene, and without a hint of cornyness, Namaste to everyone involved, everyone practicing and everyone on a journey - wherever you're headed (because I'm going somewhere too).",Ugytvkj4--I-SLPv_f14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-08-26T01:31:59Z,0.3310530118878112

And then it's like this whole other spectrum of individuals whose sole purpose is to divide and make us hate each other.

In such tough times, living with my family has made it a lot harder for me to have mental peace and now after three months of living in this house, I've lost all my patience and positivity. Today this session made me cry out of joy because of how relaxed I felt in a long time. The last 7 days of yoga were not as helpful for me mentally and I was worried that It's because of my stress and that I won't be able to achieve the mental peace I need/want .",UgwhcfO6nbZ-H3MvoUN4AaABAg,0.0,3.0,2020-06-08T07:55:20Z,-0.9968664050102234

552.0,"Wow! Just. Wow. Thank you dear Adriene. Thank you for the connection. Thank you for the healing. thank you for Home. I started home this January. I started late but that's okay. That is the freedom you nurture for us all. That it's okay. That we're okay. I think I started sometime in the second week of January and I may have made it to day 5 (not consecutively, I might add and that's okay. Do what feels good, right?). I loved that the 30 day practice was called Home. Home has always been a big theme for me and I even played for a time with branding a logo around my teaching practice using H'Om as the name of my traveling yoga studio. 

Now today, I find myself doing this practice, this day 8, feel great, don't hate, meditate practice. And the irony dawns on me. How back in January were we to know just how meaningful the Home series would be. And all this time we have been home, what has been happening? In many ways, a great healing is taking place. The broken places in our homes, our hearts, our world are being healed.There is much sadness and grief and anger and frustration and denial  and guilt and fear. But healing is taking place. 

Healing is taking place in me. Healing for the loss of my father 5 years ago. Healing for the loss of my mother just over one year ago. Healing for the broken places in me from the trauma of childhood abuse. Your words are always just what I need to hear at the time. I now have some new song lyrics stirring in my brain because this practice left me with ""tears in my ears"" as I lay in savasana. Tears are good for healing.

862.0,"Hey Adriene. I started this yoga challenge 9 days ago. I started day 1 of your yoga plan on my second day. The first day was just for me to 'reactivate' my muscle memory again and practice my breathing. It has been great. I used to do yoga but I got lazy. Since the restriction thing began, I slowly wanted to become healthier and I wanted to do yoga again. and here I am. I just want to say thank you for guiding me up to this point. I have never in my life been this discipline in following a routine. I can't wait for the days to come.

Also, I did this yesterday around 4:30pm and at the end part, the lying down part, I slowly fall into a really good sleep till 10pm. hahahahahah. The last words I remember you saying was about the blanket with love. I did this again today because I felt really relaxed. 

Thank you again <3",UgxA2jPAHd0DPx81HVh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-19T03:17:53Z,0.9983845949172974

This started out as just...a way to keep my body doing SOMETHING while I was trapped inside, maybe a chance to pick yoga back up (I was a beginner even before I wrecked my shoulder a couple of years ago and had to stop for a while) in private without anybody else seeing.


I hadn't really thought about it, until hitting Day 8 today, but it has become such a gift to have a span of time every single morning where I don't have to, I'm not SUPPOSED TO, worry about all of the things that are happening that I can't control.  For half an hour every day I get to just be here, with this.

973.0,"Like many others I started this journey in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. I am a high risk individual due to (apparently) severe asthma, and not only that but I suffer with anxiety and OCD anyway, so I'm constantly worrying that I've somehow contracted the virus even though I know it's incredibly unlikely for that to have happened to me since I have completed 2 of my 12 weeks isolation. I used to practice yoga and meditation fairly regularly but had stopped until about 2 weeks ago, when my home country, the UK, went into lockdown. At the time of writing, our UK Prime Minister is in an ICU with coronavirus, so on top of all the other chaos this virus is causing, we're all worried about him too. Since rediscovering the wonders of yoga, though, I feel calmer, even if it's only a little bit some days, in the midst of all this anxiety in these unprecedented and scary times. This healing practice today really helped me to get cosy, take time for myself and relax as best I can during these times. Whilst I'd be lying if I said my mind was completely still during this practice, what it did do is allow me to come back to myself and to practice being more aware of my breath and my feelings.

1000.0,"Coronaquest Day 8: ...and week 4 of the lockdown in Zurich. Today started off pretty rough compared to the rest of it, and I guess the absence of love is a strong reason - being on your own with no partner and no close family and being confronted with that everyday by sheer routine and repetition. Unfortunately I wasn't too receptive to the idea of covering myself with love/breathing in love, probably because I'm not very good at that sort of thing, nor hearing Adriene say ""I love you"" (even if I respect this kind of yoga-teacher-general outwards loving-kindness is for real, it doesn't really hit ""home""). Still, this session showed a technical aspect to yoga I hadn't really thought about much, so maybe it will improve practice.

1135.0,"I have started a few other 30 day practices in the past, but never got further than day 5 or 6. I never managed to find the stillness needed, always found excuses to skip a day until I just stopped all together. 
I started this practice about a week into self isolating after many months of feeling like I needed to do ""something"". And perhaps it is the idea that there is more time now, or perhaps it's because it's the start of spring and everything is feeling softer and newer, or perhaps it's that this global crisis, as horrible and daunting as it is, is giving me a feeling of connectedness, a belief that, for once, everyone in the world is doing the best they can to keep each other safe, but I have no issues now to show up every day. Because that's what it is I think, it's not whether or not I'm motivated, it's simply a desire to show up, every day, in many different ways, and one of them is on the mat.


Sorry for the wall of text, but much like a nice deep breath, I needed to let this out as well. 
Also, I think I'll just start hugging myself a little more every now and then. It felt quite nice and safe.",Ugzz0S4sEXYjtzFMkj94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-03-28T16:13:25Z,0.8424295783042908

1153.0,"When I started the journey 'Home', my intention was to 'tone my body', get flexible, and strong. I never knew that one can get mentally strong with yoga, that one can collect himself, become aware of who he is and fell in love with the treasure that is ourselves with yoga. I've gone through depression, a time where my thoughts were out of my control and were affecting my health. Constant dark thoughts and holding onto unhealthy memories caused stiff muscles and for weeks, I would get stuck in bed, unable to even move my arms. Everything would hurt. When I started this journey 'Home', I felt relaxed after each days practice, calm and motivated. I've done yoga before, about seven to eight times, for my stiff shoulders, and I cried once or twice after a good meditation. Tears would spill out of my eyes, disturbing my breath.


I cried again today. I've healed. I feel strong. I'm busy with life and happy. I've gone, from the constant overwhelmedness to sharp pain bringing panic attacks. From icy numbness to a lost feeling. I'm quite happy these days. I've grown stronger, but today, after doing this practice, I found a tear or two leak out of my eyes, and I felt hope deep inside. I healed again today, and I fell in love again. With myself. And you. Thank you so much for being utterly yourself, and for this journey home. My body, my mind, my heart, it all feels like 'Home' today.

1159.0,"Dear Adriene, I found you about two weeks ago when I looked for a yoga stretch after my run. Straight away fell in love with your way of teaching, the fun, cheerfulness and the ease you invited me into your home. Now with everything that's happening in the world, I thought it a good idea to follow your 30 days of yoga. So I started last week, right when I heard that I will have to stay home for the foreseeable future, as my job is closed for now. I don't mind staying home, it makes me be creative and love my little space, the garden, my plants, and so on. But doing yoga with you has made staying home even better. HOME has found a place in my home. Day 6 was a tough one, at the start of my own cycle, lots of emotions, feelings, feeling like doing nothing all day, but I still made it to the mat. I wasn't perse satisfied but I did it, and it was fine. BUT then, the next day, day 7 I woke up with sore muscles and it felt SO good, I did that. So it took me a day to feel satisfied, but I was happy and proud that I made it to the mat on that day 6. Day 7 truly was super helpful. And now today, again a lot of emotions, hormones, you know the tea. It almost feels like your 30 days of yoga are perfectly synced with my life, my moods, my days. It's incredible really. This was, again, exactly what I needed today. To cover myself with love, hold myself and be in the moment. Thank you so so much. I'm very excited for the rest of the 30 days, and every single day that will come after that. Hope you're doing well and taking care of yourself. Thanks for creating this community, I feel like I've finally come home.",UgymcprYquckAXl1ubx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-03-25T12:45:38Z,0.9998114705085754

If that's the case I'll just look for a relaxing session on Adriene's channel"", and then... I found this. I laughed, I smiled, I cried, I felt TOGETHERNESS. Is that a word? I don't know.

But five minutes in I realized I haven’t really heard anything you’ve said bc my mind is too busy today to really focus and get anything out of today’s practice. So instead I’m going to take the day off and I’ll be back tomorrow to try again. Somehow the practices where we do the least physically are the hardest for me to get through. I guess working my mind is harder than my body lol. So today I’m practicing understanding for myself and my body and recognizing that today this practice is slightly out of reach and tomorrow I’ll set aside more time for myself to really connect to this practice bc todya I’d just be doing through the motions and that’s not quite what I want to get out of this challenge.

I feel loved everytime i watch your videos and do your yoga flows without even knowing you in person. You have such a special way of transporting optimism and love. I'm in the middle of the Home - 30 days of Yoga right now, but I will have a surgery of my foot in about a weeks time. I wont be allowed to do any sports after that for half a year, that is sports that I will need my feet (I am actually a climber) for. So I was wondering if you can suggest any of your flows that I wouldn't have to use my feet too much, one that I could possibly modify for myself so I can still do something for myself.

1339.0,I have never committed to yoga before because I have always felt subconscious about how I do the moves. I saw the series in Jan but was not ready to commit. I waited until I was ready. This has been eye opening. This morning I got up early to do this session before I had to catch a 6am flight home. It was just what I needed. I woke up stressed out over a work situation and this session was amazing! I was able to put it aside and be in the moment.

I've learned some real life skills from doing Yoga with Adriene videos, sometimes daily, sometimes not for a few months. Adriene, I love you! I tell everyone about you, and I value you and your work so solo very much. The hug really helped, now I feel like I can help my family without taking on their anxiety and feeling burdened.

I don't even want to think about that, but he had lost half the blood he usually needs in his body. He has luckily stabilized much since then, but of course I have turned into a wreck.

This 30-day journey is a great one to expand your understanding of your unique body, it has increased my strength and flexibility.

1625.0,I’ve been doing yoga with you for almost a year and just recently finished the first 30 day challenge so I was very excited when you brought a new one out to start the year. Talking about blanketing myself with love and the love I deserve really struck a cord with me today. I started yoga last year after my first heartbreak. After that breakup I realized I didn’t love myself at all and blamed myself for a decision my partner made in finding someone else while we were still together. Now I’m realizing that maybe it was for the best because though that experience hurt me deeply that same experience made me decide not to rely on another person to value me but to learn how to value myself. I really don’t believe that I could have learned to love myself without this channel. Adriene you have brought me so much love and strength and I feel like I’ve made it a long way because of you and this community.

When I saw you had a new 30 day series, I decided to join again. But this time I’m not really enjoying it like before. I show up to the mat, but I feel I have a really bad attitude and I’m not enjoying as before. I’m not even sure sure why.

1648.0,"What a wonderful and much needed practice. 
The day I was planning to do this practice initially, my crew was sent on a 6 hour patient transfer (I work as an EMT on a private ambulance, so we do a lot of transfers). Since we still had to come back after the transfer, we were on the road for almost 13 hours. While I usually work a 13hr shift, we were given the transfer a bit late in our shift. So, I ended up getting back home about 5 hours later than usual and was so exhausted from driving. The next day (yesterday) was filled with so much anxiety. My husband and I applied for a house to rent, but we have to wait for it all to be processed and approved, and I let the stress overwhelm me. 
Today, I got back on the mat and was able to let go of all the worries and tension I let build up inside me from these past two days. I feel so much lighter yet more grounded, and I'd be lying if I said I didnt tear up near the end ;).

(I hope you read this) 

 I live in Riga, Latvia. I started doing Yoga with you at the end of last year, around the beginning of December. I started because my friend suggested you and because I needed some more mindful movement with my body. 
At the beginning of this year, I started doing 30 Days of Yoga- Home. And I love it! Yoga time in my day starts to be one of the best moments of my day. I started to do Yoga every day and now  I look forward to the next day because there will be another yoga time! 
Today I did 8th Yoga day of Home. And it was the best thing today. It calmed me down and I needed it after a stressful day at work. I couldn't calm myself down with thoughts, but yoga helped a lot! And I feel better now. So THANK YOU VERY MUCH for this kind and loving video. It brought more peace and love to me. Bless you.

1894.0,I did Day 9 then Day 8 today to get caught up. I knew Day 8 would be magical and wanted to bask in it last. Adriene did not disappoint!  We are getting lots of rain here in Missouri today. As I settled into shivasana and listened to the rain I felt the love wash over me. But the best part was when Adriene talked about surrendering to that which is so much bigger than us. As we do so there's a beautiful opportunity to recognize that surrender as unity. We indeed are part of that which is bigger than us. I love this yoga community and the blessing that Adriene is to all of us. What would the world be like if we all took the time to look inside ourselves and find that which is bigger than ourselves?  That's the magic of yoga. Namaste 🙏🏼🕉💜,UgzXbARsmjB1OpNjL694AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-10T14:47:30Z,0.9995779395103455

I did NOT want to wake up from my nap cause I'm SO TIRED, but I did it. I still have Day 9's practice to do next, but I'm so glad I pushed myself to do this today.

1941.0,"Hi Adriene,
I've been practising yoga nearly every day for about two years now, using your tutorials on You Tube for an at home practice. I decided to take up yoga to try and heal chronic back pain, or at least become better at living with/ despite it and ignoring it. My brilliant and skilled chiros and osteos could not do enough in their sessions each week/ fortnight to rectify an injury arising many years before. Daily yoga works, for so many reasons.
 At over 55, your guided yoga practice, provided with so much heart, thought and goodwill has healed that injury, and increased my flexibility. It enables me to perform better on trapeze, which I started learning about 5-6 years ago, and gives me better posture too, no doubt. There is so much truth to your philosophy, and how we learn on the mat reflects how we learn and cope in every day life. THANK YOU.

1953.0,"Today was emotionally exhausting to say the least. I was diving into the subject of how to overcome shame. After treating myself to a crystal bath ceremony, folk music and candle gazing I hopped on the mat and for the first time in a long time I was able to feel safe in my body again. This practice has made me aware of the importance of breathwork. I did the entire practice with my eye closed to aid in going within myself to find the answers I needed. I am finding the answer always comes back to being present, while focusing on the breath and on love. I feel so blessed, even after exploring the darker sides of myself I've been so scared to face. Your warmth and your nurturing energy keep me coming back to the mat more mindful and at peace than ever before.

It brings people together, validates ones pain and sorrows, embrace and be present with and grateful for the many beauties of life. I work in a hospital and my job has been stressful lately, this morning I was feeling low, like I just didn’t want to do this day. But I got on the mat, knowing if I could just get there that this feeling would pass. I agree with one of the commenters about embracing yourself, who knew it could create that feeling of being hugged by a loved one? This practice was everything I needed today, and I felt a noticeable change in how I viewed and responded to the demands of my job. Less anxiety and stress. Present with each patient. Warm in my interaction with other employees. Ease, and confidence in myself as a practitioner and as a human in general. I want to point out how insanely awesome it is that like me, every person watching your videos touches so many others every day, and is able to spread more kindness and good in the world.

I was able to relax and let go of my anxiety and stress that I struggle with on a daily basis.

2031.0,"Hey Adriene! This has really changed my thoughts about yoga. Ive dedicated myself to yoga everyday for the first time in my life. After trying and failing to get into a habit for years. You've really slowed it down in a way that's understandable and I can already feel more relaxed and feel my muscles working.

One question...on this video, you focus on breathing. I find it really hard to mindfully breath. Especially holding an inhale for too long. I start to panic. And quickly exhale. Mindful breathing seems to make me anxious. How  can I get over this ? Do you have any tips? I tend to breath very quickly so deep long breaths feel tricky

It's not always easy to HEAL is my point and simply just taking time to practice a yoga like this is enough to recharge and it so worth it, doesn't matter what anyone says or think we all need to heal as Adriene said in some way or form so thank you Adriene for this amazing loving practice, I hope u are have a great week so far and u have heal in whatever form u need it in much love to u and to benji🤗, Namaste 💕💞💗💓💖❤🙏",UgzdRcDfSFeefvDf-7J4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-10T02:50:07Z,0.9859528541564941

I'm choosing yours first because you've always been more geared towards yoga for everyone. So is Lesley, her 30 days will get done next and then I'll do Tim's. You're all fantastic teachers and, you and Lesley especially, show a lot of love and I think that's so important in a yoga teacher.

But instead of getting anxious that my breathing was so shallow, or panicking that I couldn't breathe deeply, or berating myself for not completing a ""perfect"" practice, I just let it be and allowed my body to ""find what feels good"", letting those judgemental thoughts pass through and away. And while that might seem small for some, for me that was everything. Namaste!",UgyB4bNUStRqUbDbgwF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-10T01:11:32Z,0.9944586753845215

You have reminded me to be kind to myself, you have helped me to find calm and breathe through the most heartbreaking, anxious and stressful of times. You, sweet friend, and this community have made me feel as though I am not alone. It's been quite the journey, and it's not over yet, I am so grateful to have you by my side as I continue on this path.

But the only thing I know it means is like some slang for female genitals.... a plate big enough for your female genitals... ""

I assume it's some kind of food, and will google it, but I can't get the picture out of my head hahaha

Turns out a genuine giggle totally relaxed me though, as I noticed I seem to have been trying to conquer and perfect even relaxation.",UgzTyws6gj9V6sNB2gh4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2020-01-09T22:07:00Z,0.9874401092529297

2280.0,"I was dreading a practice like this so much. It scares me, being still and not being able to focus on anything but what's inside. Instead of finding peace, I feared it would bring up all the emotional chaos instead. But since a few months I've committed to this recovery journey. Trying to let go of my beliefs over myself, my body, my feelings and thoughts, I thought that maybe now would be a good moment to just try it. To just go into the practice without the expectation of it being perfect, of it being easy, of it being peaceful. I just wanted to see what would happen. And it was a bit difficult, but I'm proud that I tried, that I stuck through the entire practice, and didn't give in to the need to ""move more"" or the thoughts about being lazy. I did what I had to do ;) the practice of day 8. Without this journey I'd never have clicked on a practice like this, and now that it belongs to the journey, I felt more open to trying it anyway.

I folded my blanket, put it right by my head once I lied down and she was purring next to my ears. At that moment, with the talk about the “blanket of love”, tears came to my eyes. I don’t really know the true meaning but for an instant, I thought to myself “for once, I’m glad to be alive”. Life is not always easy and I made life harder than it has to be. In 2020, I’m working actively on acknowledging and healing and my resolution was taken on my mat.

today I am doing some modifications in the twists and in the forward fold because I've had two moles surgically removed today(one from my back and one from my belly) and so I can't do the poses properly so as not to tear my stitches. I am quite frustrated because I won't be able to participate fully in the next couple of practices to come, but I am going to show up anyway, do what I can (sometimes just sit or stand and breathe deep) and I am surely going to repeat the practices properly when my stitches are out :) 
I really love doing yoga with Adriene and all of you, especially the practices involving vinyasas and deep stretches, but I have to remind myself that now it's more important to take care of the wounds and I can enjoy the vinyasas and stretches when it's all healed.

This really helped heal it a bit, i actually zoned out (is that the right way to write this? 😂) by the end. :) One issue I've been struggling with - I really don't enjoy holding my breath. I've been doing yoga for years, and I still can't get used to it, it's just uncomfortable and anxiety inducing and as far from relaxing as may be - as I said, I hoped it's something I get used to, but still after years for practice, more than 2 seconds just starts to feel bad - so I usually skip it altogether just doing long exhales an inhales or do a very short hold, like a second or two - is that weird?

2410.0,"I don't often comment on youtube videos, but after doing those star stretches yesterday I had a dream 
last night about touching the stars and wrote a little poem about it:



I touched the stars in my dream last night

laughed in awe as I ran my fingers through their celestial bodies

floated in an ocean of inky blackness

watched as the universe slowly cartwheeled around me

and when I wanted to return to earth

I collapsed and crumbled and plummeted like a comet

I'd like to think my dreams were reminding me of where I came from

perhaps, for the briefest of moments

taking me home



I didn't even realize I was writing a poem about going home until I finished it. Life is such a bizarre, beautiful little thing isn't it.",Ugy_AEJPNPiX4sln83Z4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2020-01-09T19:37:51Z,0.7329363822937012

Find what feels good yoga has been an incredible source of support as i do this. my healing has been done mostly on my own, because no one else can give me what i need to give myself. all of the self love talk is so helpful as i am trying to love on all the versions of myself that have suffered. it makes me feel like im not alone, like everyone else who is doing their own healing is here with me. im happy to say i dont feel like the world is just a dark place anymore.",UgwgQ1teDU2FIA44svl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-09T19:10:13Z,0.9984954595565796

All of my organs playing a symphony

The hearth this heart
Not just sitting as spare parts 
Dancing together to give me a home
A place to rest my soul

I used my eyes as windows

Usually my husband (who has been dealing with cancer for 2 1/2 years) leaves the room and goes to his desk to work, but today he stayed. Perhaps it was because you mentioned a blanket and pillow and he was already in bed, but for the first time ever, he did the practice with me. I could hear him breathing along with me, him on the bed and me on the floor. Then he continued when we sat up and did the twisting stretch. Later as you guided the facial relaxation tears were streaming down my eyes, imagining him relaxed, feeling at one with the universe, letting go of thoughts of illness. After the practice I lay down over him and blanketed him with love.

My heart was full of sadness and joy as I watched her had happily return to her new life at school.  I was also a bit apprehensive with the concept of healing and learning to love myself.  As a survivor of childhood abuse I learned to fear physical touch and became very uncomfortable with the concept of loving myself or letting others love me back.   I rarely, if ever, take the time to quietly lay still and connect with my soul and start the healing process.  Ugh that is so uncomfortable for me to even write.

Breathing love in and out is such a powerful idea for me. To believe that the universe is made of nothing but love and to take it into myself and then to put it back into the universe, is truly a healing experience. I have been adding a meditation practice after each yoga session, I'll sit and meditate for 10-20 minutes. and today I took the invitation to stay wrapped up in my blanket lying on the floor breathing in love.

I’ve been struggling with many different things (as I’m sure everybody does) so today when Adriene said “I love you” (23:19), I felt it. Instantly, a soft smiled appeared on my face and a warm sensation washed over me too. For some reason,  it was unexpected but she said it with an appreciable amount of passion and ease, I really do feel loved. 

I am so calm and at peace after today’s practice. I really am thankful for you, Adriene. You are so selfless and it is amazing what you are doing.

2799.0,"when Adriene said ""what does it mean to you, cover yourself with a blanket of love?"" I flashbacked in a very good memory, we were all at my firend's house and he was hosting us for the nights. He came very sweetly and covered myself with a cover while I was already in bed, and I remembered thinking something like ""another typical thing by x (my friend's name)"". And after 2-3 years from this memory, I was invaded by appreciation for his kindness and his attention, which was already one of his characteristics but I never appreciated it while we were together as I should. Now he's in another country and I thought: "" how many acts of love I didn't let feel in my heart, how I close my heart to one of the most beautiful things on this planet.... random kidness. This is the intention of the year for me. To open this heart, beacuse its has been closed for so so long, it is going to become too blind. Oh my God.

2852.0,"Had a interesting day yesturday as I'm someone who stammers (learning italian with a stammer is triple hard but I'm patient and passionate so will keep going) and went back to a well known centre for a support session, hadn't been to that one in years. It made me reflect on things, how i see my stammer, what i want others to know and to understand etc. Also yesturday was surprising because a small but sweet chapter closed in a sense for me. I was dating someone but we broke up due to him wanting to remain in his home country which i can totally understand why with everything going on in the UK now. We ended it on good terms and will remain friends so there is some closure and comfort in that. On reflection when I saw that day 8 would be 'heal' I thought wow this is just what I need. It as so much more then that. The essence of stillness and letting the body talk to you without words, feeling what the energetic body is telling you as it moves and sends signals to and from the brain is such a blessing. In the final moments I felt at peace and let go of all that I was feeling. My light inwards just calmed my brain and i felt peaceful, so thank you Adriene and Benji (who stole your blanket) hehe love you both very much. Find peace yogi's on day 8 despite what's going on.

I don't think I know what happens when one meditates or what the goal is. But, this actually made me be present in the moment. Hold the negative or stressful thoughts.
