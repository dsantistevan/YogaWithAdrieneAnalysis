28.0,So this is the second 30 day yoga journey I've been on and doing the side planks made me realize how strong I've gotten.,UgyoAz4fOZeq2bUp2BB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-06-14T17:14:01Z,0.9969424605369568
29.0,"I was excited to start BREATH at the beginning of January as it came out, my first 30 day series in real time with Adriene. I kept up for two days until I fell off. Over two months later, I joined again. This time I was doing it, I was building real momentum and showing up day after day. For the last few videos of the series, I felt the real strength and ease that I had dreamed of through months of trembling, sweating, resting during core work, taking extended breaks, showing up again. I was excited and inspired to immediately jump in to this HOME journey.

But as soon as I started HOME, the ease was gone. I, fully expecting to coast through the first few days when things were supposed to be easy, trembled and sweated and strained again. I was very disappointed. In one of the early videos Adriene was talking about discipline, and most of me was thinking about the pint of icecream I ate the other day, the few pounds I gained, the lack of a break I took between the two series, wondering if any of those could explain the ""reset"" in strength I'd experienced. But a tiny part of me said something different: ""what if discipline means continuing to show up, even though I'm not progressing the way I thought I would? What if discipline means trusting that my strength will return, as long as I show up?""

I was putting off doing this video all day because it sounded hard. I've been showing up every day, getting some benefits, but mostly working through my frustration at feeling weaker than I was a month ago. But this video was EASY. I broke a sweat, I worked hard, but I wasn't waiting for it to end. I didn't feel like there was anything here that I couldn't handle. I feel I'm developing the most important muscle, the muscle that helps me show up.

""just notice how you feel""
I feel GOOD.

(Thanks for reading, I just felt really inspired to say these things! And thank you, Adriene, your videos have been one of my all-time best discoveries!  :-)",UgyjDD88qPvXN6_vtK54AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2021-06-13T02:14:04Z,0.6815534830093384

I had to put down my pupper of 14 years Wednesday 💔 We have walked every single day for the last 2 years when we lost our other pupper 2 years ago. We started walking for his grief. Every day 3 times a day for 2 years. 14 thousand steps nearly every single day. I walked once yesterday so not the same. Breath like you love yourself and reset.

I knew that one day I would be able to do a side plank without thinking twice. however by the end of the practiced, I felt rejuvenated...new. So I decided to give those side planks one more try. I rewinded the video and found myself doing them, I was shaking of course but it didn't feel overbearingly painful.

But with lockdown, I decided at the start of April to redo it. 
Um...and then I decided to do it again in May, and then that I'd just carry on. 
It's now 23/10/20, and since September I've been doing two sessions a day. So by the end of the month I'll be ""caught up"" and have done 10 ""Homes"" in 10 months. 
Little achievements along the way have been thrilling but today's was THE one: I lowered to the ground from plank...NOT from my knees but from my toes.
It feels like a HUGE achievement. I'm no petite, delicate flower - and I'm very unfit and in my 40s - so this is a total milestone moment!

291.0,I've been a regular for about two years now and I love that there's always something new for me to learn mixed in with the usual classic poses. Just learned pyramid pose during this video and it felt great. Two years and some poses I sink into completely and others like happy baby are still difficult. I like that I get to be a novice and experienced all at the same time. Glad for all the folks who have found Adriene during quarantine.

316.0,"Hi there, I am not one for commenting on each class but just felt like reaching out today. I have been with Adriene's classes for 3 months now. First the 30 Days Yoga, then the 30 day Challenge, and now I find myself half way HOME . I must say that these classes and Adriene's easy breezy style makes this the best way to ground and get empowered and energized for the day.  It is the  very most impt. part of my day. I am 71 yrs old and have been doing yoga off and on for many years. There were times in the past when I did little or no Yoga at all, but this year I decided I needed to develop a home practice and this lead me to Adriene.  I am so grateful for this and I would say to any one who thinks that Yoga is too hard or to challenging, JUST KEEP IT UP.  There are some classes where I say Adriene, like NO I cant do that pose, BUT instead of giving up, I modify the pose to the best of my flexibility and hold with the idea that in time more strength and flexibility comes.  I am so grateful for these 3 courses and would invite all who read this to KEEP IT UP. Make that COMMITMENT, that we are all so afraid of , or that seems useless in these crazy times. But believe me you will see a real difference in every aspects of your lives. I love you all, Adriene, YOU ARE THE BEST! Keep challenging us and making us LAUGH , and give Bengi a HUG for me.

329.0,"Hey Adriene (or anyone else watching who has some tips) One question: Whenever we do the low lunge with the knee down and then the runner's stretch, I experience intense pain in the grounded knee and have to go out of it. Is there anything I might be doing wrong/is there a way of doing it that puts less weight on that knee? I don't have any official medical problem with my knees. You imply that this should feel easier than a low lunge entirely off the knees, but those are much less painful for me.  Would  a modification for this where I uncurl the toes and have the entire shin on the ground work? Or would a low lunge off the knee be a better way to get some of the benefits? I sometimes just skip this part of the stretch since I'm not flexible enough to straighten my leg to do the runner's stretch anyway, but want to figure out if there's a modification that I can do that can make me reap some of the benefits here.

426.0,So I started the home series on april first which was perfect and filled me with joy because april has 30 days and it seemed to be a perfect healthy challenge in this quarantaine period. Unfortunately I started to feel pain in my left wrist 2 days ago and today was the day I knew it would be damaging to continue the practice (this practice to be precise). Ofcourse it makes me kind of sad that I won't be able to reach my goal anymore but it's more than that. Doing yoga for the last two weeks (and seperate video's before) really made a great positive difference in how I feel physically and (maybe even more important) mentally . This morning I did the video for pain in the wrists and I learned more about the right technique so I can be more aware in the future. But for now in the meantime I need to take a rest and let my wrist get back to normal again. So I will complete the series later. For now I'm searching for video's without having to use my wrists. If you have any yoga with adriene video recommendations about that I'd love to hear! Also if you've gone through something similar I'd love to hear how you handled it :)!

449.0,"Hello Adriene!
My name´s Angelika. I´ve been practicing yoga with you since 4 years (with breaks I need to admit). However, when it comes to yoga I always choose your practice. I like the warmth that comes from you towards participants of your classes online. Thank you so much for sharing these classes with us!
I am writing to you with one question. My elbows are double jointed. Are the exercises when I need to support myself on one hand safe for me? I mean for example the moment when I need to hug my ribs. The supporting hand is shaking so much and it´s uncomfortable feeling. A lot of personal trainers recommend to me exercising with bent elbows but in this case I can´t maintain the bent arm. I need your advice if I should practice this type of exercises in short periods of times (just some seconds) or in my case it´s better to just give up them.
Lots of love and happy Easter!

I also got my left leg up from downward-facing dog into a lunge for the first time without having to use my hands to guide it up!!!

587.0,"WOW, the HOME playlist is my first ever experience with yoga and it has brought such a change to my life already!! I never expected to keep up with the daily practices, let alone to look forward to them.. So far, I've always done my practice in the morning. Today likewise (day 14 for me). However, I had such an emotionally draining day today that I decided to chuck in a second practice this evening. And OH MY GOSH, this RESET practice was exactly what I needed!! The fast pace, the flow, the lion's breaths and the little moments of pure pride when I felt totally in control of certain poses that I thought I wouldn't be able to master.. I know it's only day 15 but I truly feel like this might change my entire life! THANK YOU ADRIENE!!",UgwJb-bYdEDt77zdZzB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-02-14T19:31:10Z,0.9970302581787109

My mind lifted and I kinda felt energised though being quite sick still. Today was such a lovely day and I felt strong enough to continue my Yoga Journey at Day 13, 14 and 15- Grow, Return and Reset.

Realized to be coordinated this quickly after waking, needs more than 3 sips of coffee.  But, continue I must... I showed up and that’s the worst part.  So, I’m slowly getting more coordinated as we go along and all was going good - yes, easy on wide stance on toes...  please with that.  Then did three lions breaths into my pj tops, to find Ms. Lonnie coming to check on if I’m okay, I see my pj’s top move as she tries to comfort and check up on me.  Then as were in some version of child’s pose...  she’s hugging me, giving me kisses, sorry Adriene, but you lost me for a few seconds, while I laugh and scratch her and reassure her that I’m fine.

I'd like to suggest, with respect, that you might look into supporting actively ethically made clothing for your merch. I believe that part of being our best includes making choices mindful of how they will impact others. The shirts you offer are from brands that have committed to only the most basic level of social responsibility. 
I am not judging or trying to shame anyone, just asking that you consider it.
Obviously none of us (including myself!) are perfect, but I think it is our responsibility to at least think about it and decide where we stand.

851.0,"y'ALLLL. the magic of yoga is somehow so subtle and next-fuckin'-level at the same time. today, I kept marveling at how different my body felt when I first started yoga, and how a couple years ago, I would have been CURSING my way through some of these poses. I still wobbled and bobbled during this practice (mostly when my attention wavered to thought instead of presence)... but it happens :) & we can just RESET!  

Grateful for the opportunity to pay such lavish attention to myself and for this tender little meatsuit of mine. Grateful for this commenting exercise I started, for the space to truly just take a MOMENT and appreciate all that yoga has gifted me and what I've gifted myself through my practice, instead of hustling and bustling to get the rest of the day ""done"" (guilty of this in the past 30-day yoga challenges).

Another day I might not feel the magic like I did today, and the magic will be there with another practice. That’s why doing yoga everyday is such a wonderful journey !
And this year for me is special because after doing yoga for more than 3 years, I’ve decided to start running too. For me it feels like a miracle because I used to absolutely hate running. But because of yoga I’ve realized just how enjoyable, how wonderful your body can feel when you take care of it so I want to combine yoga with another kind of exercise and running seems like the obvious choice. You can do it anytime anywhere. And with the pre-run yoga video I have all the tools I need. And Adriene’s smile to encourage me lol !

As funny and awkward as I must have looked, it felt great, I could feel yesterday’s work in my hips, and ending the session with a move that I could easily push myself into was needed.

911.0,"Day 15 reset babe. I always have this nervousness when it comes to side plank but boy was today's practice good to me😁, I just flowed and taughts came and went and I kept breathing and it was wonderful, it such a wonderful thing to have one of those days where even when thle practice it's asking us to move out of a comfort zone and instead of letting the fear or nervousness get the better of us we just go with and find that ease and peace of mind. I am so grateful for that today, it's not like it's new or anything it's just that some days it just makes the daily practice  so much more gratifying cause some days when the practice is challenging and I have a bad experience with a pose or in general, my mind tends to carry it and when I am come across that pose again it makes me nervous about being able to practice it but even tho I have been practicing for a while now and I have all this vocabulary I still underestimate my abilities to practice different posture and I know the practice grows my pose cause I can practice posture now that I could not when I first started yet my mind always doubts it and today I had a break from that doubt and I am content and grateful. I have to mention this one thing that always reminds me of my abilities is when Adriene gives us her juicy pieces of wisdom, it could be a joke about ""wrapping the hair around your knuckle"" 🤣 or that it's okay to fall of the house but it's how you get back on it, some times it is such a joy to come on the mat cause I know I will either discover something new about myself or have a good laugh or both and for that Adriene I thank you and will alway be grateful to u for help me love taking care of my body, much love to u and benji and everyone who is practicing with us , Namaste Everyone and goodnight 💕💞💗💓💖❤🙏",UgwME08HvvjeC2oedGx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-17T00:45:11Z,0.9992676377296448

I can tell you that while I was waiting for the numbing to start, I used the breathing techniques that I learned over the last 15 days when I felt anxiety and fear creeping in.

While I have  been teaching yoga in rural communities around the world for several years, ...... as long as  I am fortunate enough to have internet access,  I find that receiving videos and offerings from you and your great team of people always give me a lift and helps me feel that I am part of something  bigger.  Although yoga has  been my practice for more than 45 years, and a great life-line it has been for me indeed, the ""delights"" that you share are a ""sweet"" for my soul and a perfect addition to my routines.  When nothing new is coming in, I most often tune into your ""Fire Away"" session ..... just to make sure my own energy is not slipping.

I've never done Pyramid pose before and happened to have my back to the TV the first time so I had to stop and peak for that part and for some reason I never faced the right hand side of my ""mat"" (I don't actually have a real one, I just pretend lol).. but ANYWAY 😋..
