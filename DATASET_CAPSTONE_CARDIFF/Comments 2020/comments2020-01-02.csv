2.0,"Yesterday I was so mad and sad and frustrated that I was physically defeated and was able to do very little of the practice....but I powered through. Today, I remembered yesterday about halfway through. How could I forgot that in just 24 hours? Yesterday I was sure the feeling of defeat would last forever, and today I nearly forgot about it entirely. Life is so strange like that. I'm grateful that I remembered, and I wouldn't have remembered without coming back to the mat. I look forward to gaining more insight on the ebb and flow of life, and building a sense of faith that a terrible day may be followed by a fine day, and I just need to be still and wait for it to come.",UgxSbl25bCbO-rN0zed4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-04T04:32:11Z,0.9787442088127136

62.0,"Dearest Adriene, just to give some background, I'm a 44 year old man in Canada, and a few years ago my sister (a big yoga advocate) told me to do Yoga with Adriene. I had previously done hot yoga, but I was out of practice. I think I tried one day of the 30 day program, but left it behind. Well this year after my 44th birthday, I felt I wasn't on a good path, my exercise routine was limited, and each weekend was filled with pizza, beers and the loneliness of the pandemic. Anyhow I made a commitment to get active and be fit. I remembered what my sister told me about the 30 Day Yoga program. I did all 30 days of the (yoga program you made 5 years ago), and I didn't miss a day! I feel great and I feel good about myself again. I took a short 4 day break after the 30 days ended, but I didn't want to lose the momentum. I just finished Day 2 of the Home Yoga program. It's great to be active again, and I enjoy joining my grade 3 students (I've taught online all year) for online dance and exercise activities. I want to introduce them to some of your classroom videos too.  I truly want to thank you for your amazing spirit, your gift in teaching yoga to others, and for me making me smile in every class.

I‚Äôve practiced on and off for several years but I‚Äôve grown stronger, more flexible and more confident as I moved through the first 30 day series and I‚Äôm excited to keep going with Home and then it will be on to Breath.

I have difficulties still with some basic fundamentals. 
1) Sitting  - Using a cushion while by blocks are in the mail which will help a little but sat my legs poke up at least 45 degrees from the floor, left is worse than right. it's difficult to sit relaxed as I am constantly using the thigh and back muscles to correct the posture and stay in the position, feels strained in the hip joints.
2) Low lunge - Difficult to get into the pose properly as to reach my fingertips to the floor have to press my whole body into my thigh and round my shoulders forward, feels like I'm doing it all wrong.

Unfortunately, I have a wrist injury and it's really hindering my practice. No amount of rest is helping me heal and i've had numerous cortisol injections. What should I do about my yoga?

Tony Robbins talks about adding a morning exercise and when I did yoga classes at the YMCA years ago I really enjoyed them. I own a construction company and work it full time so over the years I have developed a very tight back, neck, and hips, plus shoulder issues.

988.0,"I had begun to follow you 4 years ago with the first 30 day yoga challenge. I stopped soon after, as I was not in a great place and could not push through and love myself enough to believe in the practice or anything.
I was taught yoga almost 19 years ago for an improv class I did in college during my theatre diploma and we started every class with it. For years I thought I hated yoga bc didn't understand it and could not enjoy it. I tried, several times and got frustrated with my lack of flexibility and the hard poses that I just could not get my body to do. 



Now, also after several years of frustration and desperation, I'm back in the acting game (didn't know you were also an actor) and have started to let go and release a lot of heartache and self-doubt as I am on a journey of self-love and de-programming. It isn't always easy but my commitment to exercise and my deep desire to show up is stronger than ever and I genuinely enjoy your practice. There are certain days that I literally cry on the mat as you dive into intention or talk in the pauses. I am so utterly grateful for your generous and open spirit and that I have found you here. I love doing this practice at home, albeit in a small space...I couldn't really picture enjoying it with anyone else leading the class even if you're not in the flesh!


I am eternally grateful for you and all that you've brought to us in this collective practice.

While, not many will comprehend my ‚Äúintent‚Äù, I am again taking my thoughts with me on this 30 day journey in the comments section so I can reflect back and see where I was mentally on that day.  My ‚Äúintent‚Äù is to stop Sabotaging my success. I clearly now realize that I am afraid to succeed, especially when it comes to competition in a women‚Äôs bodybuilding contest. When I begin to progress at transforming myself for a bodybuilding contest, I believe I actually get scared at my progress and I thwart the progress by excuses which my psyche believes. It is because I know that God has given me the passion to compete since I‚Äôve been 14years old (now 48)  and I have never yet had the courage to complete my training and step onstage. (though I must have tried what seems now over 100 times)Truth be told, I am disappointed in my self every day because of this fear of the unknown of success and I pray this 30 days with you will transform my mind, body and soul connection to finally tell my subconscious that enough is enough!!!

""The more we practice moving with intentions and thoughtfulness, the more likely we are to have these tools when we need them the most. On the mat, in a hard posture or on a day when we didn‚Äôt really want to show up or off the mat when we become angry or upset ‚Äî do we have the practice under our belt to be thoughtful; to pay attention to recognize that our thoughts and words are important and our intentions can cultivate or amplify the things we want to manifest.

1293.0,"A little confession here: I had to do this session twice. Yesterday, while doing it for the first time, I noticed, in the middle of the practice, that I was struggling more with my breathing than with the planks. As soon this thinking came to my mind, I disconnected from the practice and it's meaning (to intend). And, funny enough, my intention was to ""connect"". So when I finished it, I took the decision of doing it again the next day. It was the best decision ever. Today, when setting my intention, I went a little further: ""connect with my inner power"". I repeated it like a mantra during the session. I also paid more attention to my breathing and softened my movements. It went amazing. It's like I did two completely different sessions. Even I got to notice stuff that I didn't yesterday (like Benji's little claws walking through the room and some things Adriene said). So yeah, this is my story for Day 2. I didn't want to fall (more) behind by redoing an entire session, but I knew that it was the right thing to do. When you really set an intention and go for it during your practice, yoga gets a new meaning. Namaste üôè.",UgwOVFO7oO5Rv2Ljeax4AaABAg,11.0,498.0,2020-01-08T12:56:35Z,0.9987829327583313

1400.0,"I missed day 2, and day 3 I did my own flow outside after dancing with friends.  
One thing I am actively choosing with yoga, is to be kind to myself if I miss a structured day of it.  I can find moments of yoga in a busy setting, and then I will come back when the stretch of time is available. 
One intention set, is to make movement a priority, yet in a manner that doesn't feel like a ""have to"", but... ""I want to.""
Your yoga videos have definitely helped me to just get up and do yoga with or without a structured video. 
When I was doing another 30 day series, it took me so much longer than 30 days to do it, but I was like, ""I'm stronger and 3 days of yoga a week is better than no days of yoga a week!""

1728.0,"One of my favorite people to listen to is Alan Watts, and something mind blowing he would do often is pronounce and redefine words that we use often in conversation to give it a deeper context. When thinking about ""intend"" today, I though of it as in-tend...and the antonym ex-tend. With this in mind through practice, the mantra that manifested was the following: 

""Whenever I extend myself for validation, I will in-tend to reason of why I seek outside of myself in the first place.""  In-tention of anything becomes an ex-tention through work, and yoga is one of the things I will show up for each day to strengthen my intention.

Also friends, if you ever have trouble showing up for practice, something that has helped me be consistent is that just being here is much better than not showing up at all. If you are tired, just lay on the mat and do the best you can. There is no need to hit all the poses perfectly, because it's not about that in the first place.

That reached deep into my soul. And I asked my soul, ""why don't you want to let go""? The response I got back was fear. So my intention since then, has been to ""let go"". I have been telling my subconscious - I know you have been trying to protect me, and you have done a great job. But it is time to let go now. We need to move on.

Focusing on the intention this practice, has released something inside me. It is small; it will take the letting go of lots of little bits and pieces before the fear is gone and I make it to peace.

I'm mostly better now, but it has been about the same amount of pain for the last month.  I've participated in the 30 day challenge for 4 years now and I was convinced I was going to have to sit this one out.  Then I remembered that Adriene has taught us all kinds of variations and her motto, FWFG.  I'm on day 2, and I'm letting my body tell me what it needs.  I'm glad I'm here and I'm glad all of you are too. Namaste.",Ugy8fUtefWqMKNPhxIl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-03T15:57:54Z,0.970641016960144

2157.0,"I just wanted to offer some advice for anyone new to yoga. It's amazing. You will tone your body while getting an amazing stretch. You will stand taller and feel leaner. Don't be discouraged if you don't look like adriene in her poses and postures, just ""find what feels good."" Adriene tells us that its your body and everyone is different, we all slept different and have different pains. So modify the poses and moves as needed until it feels right in your body. Also if your wrists hurt you can make a fist and use your fists instead of palms. But your wrists will hurt sometimes, you just have to remind yourself in your head to be light and loosen any pressure you are putting in your wrist. So press into all ten fingers. You just have to practice :) and if the video is too fast for you, you can change the speed. I like to take my time and hold certain postures longer so changing the speed to be slower comes in handy. One more thing you don't need ""yoga clothes"" I do yoga in my pajamas every day.

2166.0,Thank you Adriene. I truly appreciate your classes. They are the highlight of my morning while drinking a berry smoothie. The intention for me was more about letting go and surrendering but also while cultivating some gratitude. Its nice to do yoga slow for once. I found that the mind did intercept and I did get misaligned sometimes during the down dog/ transitioning to plank and then back to the down dog. It was hard to feel aligned in that for some reason.  I suppose its because we start to fixate too much on being perfectly aligned. I guess it will get better the more I slow down and take these classes with you with intentional focus. The body messes up but the heart is dedicated. Thank you for humbling me on my yoga journey to really slow down and this is really helping me to clean up the lines and forms and have a more intentional experience with yoga rather then just going through the motions <3 Thank you again <3,Ugy7G2F80FALn3TZ75t4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-03T14:27:57Z,0.9978175163269043

2235.0,"Lovely Adriene,
Forgive the length of this comment. I've been practicing yoga with you for a few years now, but only physically, and always intermittently. Six years ago I lost my leg and without giving it real thought I mindlessly assumed yoga was out for me. Then I found a few seated flows and would only do them if I could sit or lie the whole time. This past year I went back to your videos and decided that I wanted to engage in the yoga that seemed unrealistic for me. Your loving way of guiding us through the practices taught me to be patient with myself, to listen to my body, and I began to emotionally connect with the poses, and truly enjoy the process rather than look to a desired outcome.
I can now, without getting irritated as I once did, easily flow in and out of my prosthetic as needed in a practice, find more strength and connection with my body, and the inner and outer growth is tangible.
This is the first 20-Day practice I've signed up for and my husband and I get right out of bed and do it before anything else. Thank you for your gentleness, the sincere love with which you teach, and for teaching me to be a better student. So much love and gratitude to you, and Happy New Year. <3",UgzL9tx_mwSyXFkpulF4AaABAg,1.0,2.0,2020-01-03T12:59:32Z,0.9984581470489502

I realised my intention was to be gentle with myself. Practicing every day, is my way of effectively giving back to my body and to my mind and to my spiritual self and it is the one time where I am so very kind and loving to myself, mindfully so, for an extended period of time.

I can do one hand (which means I'm askew on my yoga mat) or no hands (which sure makes it a LOT harder) or lizard variation, but not a normal lunge.

I was doing this today morning in our kitchen, cos we have a guest sleeping in the livingroom and i didn't want to bother them.

Then she walked around the laptop and went to sit behind the screen, looking at the video from upside down angle and every now and then shifting her gaze at me, like making sure i was doing the same thing as the video! 
And then she decided to climb up to my lap as i was sitting legs crossed in the beginning. Once i had to start moving i lifted her up next to me on the yoga mat. She continued following me very closely through the whole practice, and at the end when i was flat on my back on the floor, she climbed on top of my belly and stayed there purring.",UgzlA1qxiIBdvIbumBd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-03T07:03:19Z,0.9818210005760193
