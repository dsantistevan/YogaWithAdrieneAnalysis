4.0,"Hi Adriene and others,

I am noticing that everytime I do a Forward Fold, and then coming in to standing pose, I get really dizzy. I do the Forward Fold position regularly myself to really ground, but to roll op I take a minute or two. Then it doesn¬¥t happen. So that part of the yoga practise goes to fast, i guess? I pause the video and continue in my own pace. But still a little worried abou tthis happening. Is it normal? I do the yoga practise before eating breakfast, maybe that¬¥s something that is influencing?",Ugxw01oQWErlbPy3eMF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-29T09:48:45Z,-0.9915273785591125

I wanted to make room for the yoga video for today because I set myself the challenge to make it, no matter what and I am asking myself if it was better to skip one day and really mean it or to do it however distracted I am. I guess the latter works for me because a) the continuity gives me a security and a chance to hope tomorrow will be different and b) as you pointed out - it is about inquiry and about learning about myself. Why am I distracted? What keeps me from granting myself the time for yoga? Am I maybe also a little rebellious? I feel a little rebellion in me, as in ""I did yoga for 8 days now, can't I have a day to rest?""... Learning a lot about myself and inner demons that I am facing through the routine alone!

I had a question, my right wrist is hurting a bit - i've always had weak wrists especially my right wrist, but i never put pressure on them so never usually feel a discomfort. What can i do to healthily do yoga and strengthen my wrists rather than do any damage? I'm 31, healthy.  Thank you.

768.0,"Let me be completely honest to you: I have commitment issues. At the beginning of this journey I was full of motivation and joy. 
I was sure that I'd follow the journey and do each practice accordingly without skipping any. A few days later I told myself it's okay not to pressure myself to follow the practices strictly and do them every day. So sometimes I did two practices and sometimes I did none. Now I feel terrible due to my lack of discipline.

A whole lot has happened in a few days and I've been overwhelmed by all the unrest and tension in my mind and body. There always appears the thought that if I'd followed your practices and if I'd done one every day it wouldn't be that bad.
My mum told me that I'd looked after my body but not my soul and she's absolutely right. I tend to have self destructive behaviour a lot. Doesn't mean I'm hurting myself physically and/or intentionally but I feel like there's a voice in my head that doesn't want me to be happy. 
The weirdest thing is that I do know what I need to do in order to feel better but most of the time I can't and I just don't know why. 
Hopefully I can find some peace though your practices. They've worked before but still I can't expect them to be the magic remedy to all of my problems. There simply is none and the only thing that can help me is to solve it myself. People always tell me the same stuff over and over again but they're right: they can only support me while I need to find peace within myself on my own. 

Still I want to thank you again for all the love you express in your practices. I've already learned a lot through you while you've also helped me through some tough and dark times. This is just another rainy season that's going to pass.

773.0,"Hi A,
I went yesterday to a yoga class for the fist time after one year of at home yoga . I felt very different. 
I was focus on the quality of move ,not just hitting a pose.
I felt free to do the adjustment my body needed
I push myself as much as I wanted that day 
I was carefree to improvise and listen to what my body was saying to me 
I used the class as I do with you as a guide not a rule 

I must thank you for that cause doing things at home gave me the freedom to explore and now I am very happy when it happens in a share space to explore and experiment .

Just wanted to share this experience with you

So when you said 'creaky body' today it made me smile with recognition. Very grateful for this practice. <3",UgzjlOOYC2Yrk0pq2Md4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-11T16:53:35Z,0.8100100159645081

I wanna say thank you: you just made me realize that Love is a verb. My brain knew, now my body and mind does. The titles of your videos in this program are all verbs, each to call in to action our self love. Yesterday I haven't been loving myself much, but I showed up on the mat still. I was unsatisfied after, not at ease with myself. But then, today, while drinking tea and eating fruits, I was wondering what verb would you call day 10 (the one I am into), so that made me remember of all the ones that are: inquire, ignite, recognize, heal etc. and then it struck me: love is a verb. You have to let that love call you into action. It is a practice, it is a natural yet forgotten state, I sense it deep in my soul. You and the practice of yoga (and any kind of self love) is showing us the way to ourselves by activating Love through verbs. Thank you. Words do matter. Prayers do have an effect.

It's kinda special how much your attitude can be adjusted in fifteen minutes.

I do enjoy these session with a little more heat. I can feel little promises of anger in some of my leg muscles already and I'm happy to know they're getting some attention.

1178.0,"I've been experiencing resistance these past couple days. HEAL was lovely, done in a dark room with the full moon above. I dozed off in savasana, then had a night of insomnia. I never have trouble sleeping, so it just threw me off-kilter. Some good came of it, but my energy was just...agitated, overall. 

Today, I approached getting on the mat as a ""checklist"" item, anticipating a lackluster practice, because I felt like I'd gotten the day off on the wrong foot by waking up late. I did run before practice, so my muscles were warmed up, and actually, it all flowed incredibly well. I connected to my breath and my pigeon was on point, so I just put some attention on the fact that I had come to the mat with some ickiness. 


aaaand I'm about go FULL DEAR DIARY up in here, I can feel it coming - but I'll take the theme of inquiry as an invitation to feelings vom everywhere :) 



some of what I came to the mat with -- after I rode the ""SHINY NEW DECADE!"" energy into an auspicious beginning for 2020, I've been slipping into some old habits...and it's only been a week! of course, the place to strive for is self-forgiveness -- but perhaps I was jumping there too quickly, without also acknowledging the (quote-unquote) negative emotions of disappointment and letting them exist. so that disappointment/ickiness ends up getting projected on to other areas (i.e. YWA) that I'm subconsciously associating with transformation. (i.e. ""what is even the POINT, i shall forever languish as a useless BLOB"") 
and of course, with inquiry, we can choose to see our experience with curiosity. in regards to some of the ""old"" habits (a sticky, interconnected web of ego stories about procrastination, internet browsing/surfing + phone use, being a Productive and Useful Member of Society) -- yes, I don't want to be manipulated by the endless dopamine quest, but also, I did have the thought that maybe it can also be a signal that I'm seeking connection in my life. I'm quite independent, but I was traveling a lot for the first half of 2019, then resettled into a new city, where I'm still getting on my feet, and...just. it's okay to feel some type of way. 

sigh. wherever you go there you are! 



I feel better with the opportunity to untangle some of these thoughts. writing this out for more public-facing consumption does encourage me towards clarity, rather than just purging everything through journaling, but maybe not necessarily critically engaging what's ""true."" I feel like I've mined some useful reminders for moving forward, as well - (1) process, not perfection; (2) let the negative ""be"" without judgment (3) take some time and space for gratitude + wins.. today, I ran longer than I ever have in my entire goddamn life! and it was done almost automatically. & i'm still here, documenting my journey! just a reminder that things ARE shifting and chang; celebrating the small wins will light the way.

1276.0,"""I love you, body"" *gives it a kiss* haha, that was sweet! I did not pay too much attention to my breathing, today, which might be why I collapsed a few times. (ROOKIE MISTAKE. YUP!) I need to do things slow instead of going fast or at a quicker pace than I should. No wonder I can't keep up afterwards! The energy flow felt great, as always. The latter can feel like too much for me at times -it can turn into cardio that I didn't welcome in- but I always get excited when I feel that rush. The bent knee felt like a happy, peaceful breeze on my right side rather than on the left. Probably because I didn't prepare my body well on the left side, since my abs weren't really squeezed in. Other than that, I loved the pigeon pose which was perfect at the end of the practice.


Also, the love cave when in downward dog kinda pisses me off haha. It's really annoying when it happens because I can't see my legs or the screen but life happens, I guess!?! :P",UgyheIJQY6Y3XbtHIhJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-10T18:45:14Z,0.9139801859855652

I spent my early twenties trying to drink my way out of the pain. Spoiler: it didn‚Äôt work. About eleven years ago, I tried to kill myself. After that I began the long hard journey to true recovery and healing: through therapy, exercise, yoga and meditation. Ive come so far from where I started and I feel strong and contended almost every day. Because of that strength I am now more equipped to process some of the pain from my childhood and today it emerged on the mat, there for me to observe and feel, to accept and integrate. It‚Äôs amazing to me that it is becoming something I no longer have to run from. But it‚Äôs also scary because it‚Äôs something that almost destroyed me. Thank you for sharing your tools with us.

The zip, zap, zop reference in Day 6 and the the emphasis on being honest with what is present encouraged me to take a leap and share this link in case anyone in the YWA community wants to engage in a random act of kindness by donating or sharing: https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-a-lesotho-doctor-with-medical-expenses?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&fbclid=IwAR270rEiWxlL0Xsj87HtbC6C6FggucpqKwsajMMyTV9phIELoLLqsog1H-c


I work as a teacher and mentor in a family medicine training program in the southern African country of Lesotho. In a country where there is only 1 doctor for every 15,000 people, our trainees have an incredible opportunity to serve their community and make a huge impact. Unfortunately one of our kind, funny, skillful trainees, Dr Mac, was found to have a mass in his esophagus which is likely early cancer. He and his family are struggling with the expenses associated with diagnosis and treatment, largely b/c since these serves are not available in Lesotho and he must travel to South Africa for this healing journey.  We use ""zip zap zop"" as a energizer practice during our teaching sessions (Dr Mac is pretty good at it!) which was why Day 6 reminded me of him during my practice.  I apologize if this is not the appropriate forum but we are all just a few degrees of separation (or no degrees at all of separation in some ways) from eachother and I figured I'd take a risk and share here in this new community I'm happy to be a part of.

1525.0,"Loving the Home practice.  Keep thinking about a wonderful poem written by one of the founders of 'Breathworks', Garry Hennessey, and wanted to share it with the community - enjoy:


""I have come home
From self-imposed, long exile
To this imperfect body.
Comfortable in my discomfort.
Welcomed, like the Prodigal Son, returning.
No blame.
No guilt.
No recrimination.
Only love.
So simple.
Loneliness healed.
Now everyone is welcome
To my home.""

It seems like I am very insecure about my own abilities, which is making me to be my own demon. How about that? This gives me a lot to think about, cause I'm seriously confused to why I am doing this. It's basically self sabotage and that's just stupid. Anyone else sitting in the same boat?
