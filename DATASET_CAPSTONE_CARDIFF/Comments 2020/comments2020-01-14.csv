4.0,"I just want to say that I always revisit the HOME practice, as it helped me get through the struggles of the 2020 quarantine. When I revisited this video today, I was feeling overwhelmed by returning to work on Monday and all of the things I had on my Sunday to-do list. But by the end of this video, I felt completely relaxed... During the final pose when my were eyes shut, I saw a still and solid crimson-red circle. Now... I've never been one to focus on balancing my chakras (let alone know what each of them are/do), but I googled the red chakra which turned out to be the ""root"". 

Adriene, thank you so much for this practice. It literally rooted me, helped me reconnect, and allowed me to 'return' to the present moment. <3",UgzN5kDogw69Alu1dXR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-11-28T19:57:42Z,0.9988337159156799

Now there's Adriene!  Her practices have everything I need/want--careful design, humor, variety, attention to form, a marriage of the inner and outer bodies--a deep sense of the joyful and every-changing yoga I once knew and loved.  I am astonished that my almost-70-year-old body is quickly able to find a home in poses that once were difficult for me.  At first, I would take a day or two's rest after a few taxing days to allow my muscles to regroup, but now I see that Adriene's practices are designed to let that happen naturally, and I am putting myself on the mat each day.

I found the lizard pose super easy (apart from my weak arms holding me up) with my right knee forward, which is my lower hip. But the left knee forward if I tried moving my knee out at all to get it out of my armpit, my hip would make this really fun pop/grinding noise. Didn't hurt at all, just clearly was moving it off the rails a little bit haha. This practice has been a very nice way so far to connect with my body, both in the complete lack of arm strength (though I can hold downward dog for at least 10 seconds longer than I could on day 1 now haha) and also in exploring my scoliosis. It's not severe and really is only painful when i stand for long periods, so I don't often connect with it. It's been nice.

340.0,"So, I don't usually tend to write, say, or reveal my feelings to people.
But something has happened in the last few days since I started my 30-day journey.
I don't usually do yoga, either because it is in front of other people and feels competitive and impersonal, or because it requires involving emotions. And I'm the best at keeping inside. I decided to try because I wanted a physical change, and after a few days I had a strong emotional experience that I had not experienced in a long time.
I felt myself fall into the deepest pit and into my deepest fears. It felt like my heart was breaking. I was crying my hearth out, crying my past and all my fears.  
And after skipping one day, and completing it the next day, I felt like the name of the workout, its content, and the words that have been said by Adrian, bringing me back to life.
I'm only at the begining of this, of putting myself out there and saying what I want and what I need, But I wanted to say Thank You.",UgxxU1Z1CCv5clWwQ7t4AaABAg,0.0,9.0,2020-05-10T08:57:29Z,0.9932494163513184

I followed your True, 30 days yoga, and Yoga camp last 4 yrs ago and I really saw big difference aside from just running alongside. I also followed your yoga for runners and that is when I started. When I work in the office, I mind my breathing to reduce the stress and now I apply your yoga stretches when I hit the gym. While on quarantine now, I go running the afternoon and do your yoga Home after. Really helps me to still tone my body and reduce work stress. Thank you so much for your videos!

It's only been less than a month since I first started doing yoga with you but the improvements are unbelievable (even though I took rest days in between). I'm feeling stronger, more centered, more present in the moment, calmer, and lost a lot of fat. Imagine this: I could fit into my shorts from my teenage years, after not being able to wear them for a few years!
I didn't even count the calories or limit myself from eating what I like. If I wanted some cookies, I make some for myself and eat it. My body does the portion controlling all by itself, so there's no way I'd overeat something (even if I do, my body instinctively knows how to balance it the next day). I don't beat myself up for having cravings; I give my body what it wants, along with the nutrients it needs, of course. I'm the happiest I've ever been. I've finally found a type of exercise (with meditative quality) that I can't wait to do every day. It really feels like coming home. I would like to thank you again, Adriene. You're awesome.

483.0,"About four years ago, I had a horseback riding accident that rotated my hip bone 3/4 of the way around. I started treatment at the chiropractor's but I still had endless amounts of back, shoulder, and hip pain. This created a lot of pain associated with exercise, and I gained weight, making it even harder to exercise. Today is the second week of doing yoga every day with this series, and for the first time in four years, I have no pain in my back, shoulders, and hips. These hip-focused stretches were a little intense, but afterwards I'm left with this *heavenly* feeling in my joints. Aside from all of the amazing physical results (I feel stronger, have lost some weight, and am more flexible), I've had important breakthroughs in my mental health involving my self worth. I will return to healthy eating because I deserve it. I deserve to be strong and healthy. I deserve to eat nutritious food. I am worth it.

514.0,"Ok, first of all, this practice didn't feel like 27 minutes, it felt like just 10! Second, I loooooove hip openers, maybe my favourite kind of stretching. Now, about what I want to return, the first thing that I thought was ""normal life"", since we're in self-isolation and the world is facing a horrible pandemic. But, I know that's something that's not under my control. So I changed it (I didn't have to think that much about it, it poped up immediately) and the thing I want to return to is writing. I've always considered myself a creative person, but lately It's been harder for me to sit and write, coming with ideas for stories, and even journaling, and those were things I really used to love. I know it's in me, I just want to feel that connection again. Thanks to this practice I decided it's time. Maybe you'll find me doing some creative writing exercises tonight ;).

And even if I wanted to return home to help my parents, I'll be stuck there, far away from my new ""home"" until this is all over.

558.0,"Thank you Adriene. It's late March and I have just finished this day 14. The year so far has presented difficulties to me, some fairly intense, but I'm enjoying making my way slowly through this series mixed in with some other yoga videos. I shared your channel on my Facebook page recently due to many people staying at home and have had at least one friend come on board really enjoying your videos and personality. We both agree you are genuine. For the time being a couple times a week we do the same video at the same time and laugh at things like the Beyonce chakra, open the pickle jars, namaste shark fin, and more! Speaking of returning, today I returned to reading the book March by Geraldine Brooks and also to drawing a sprig of Forsythia on grey paper with color pencil. Also since  my life has seen rough and churning waters in the mental space I felt like during pigeon (maybe also called rock dove!?) with my head down, I might just taste a return to feeling like I did before when I felt my spiritual path was more meaningful and loving. This feeling has been challenged lately - sometimes it's like the universe sets you up with some long dreamed of hopes, only to dash them on the rocks.

Now there's one question that i have: What is your view on the necessity of 'counter-movements' like when you're doing a position that makes the hips open, you then compensate it by a movement that closes the hips again? I am using the hips as example, because I notice that in your video's there are a lot of hip-opening movements but not so much the opposite. Sometimes it does not feel so comfortable for me so I mostly end with some counter movements. What's your opinion on it and have you got other tips for me how I might be more comfortable in these positions?

I then fell asleep, woke up this morning to do this video, and saw that your email said it'll be a juicy hip-opener.

Not to mention I always end up just picking up where I left off and continuing the challenge daily til it's over.

""A sweet return
Knees to chest, kissing skin faces
Popping toes, doodling hearts

An embrace-
Of self
Of care
Of truth

Alarms set, coffee prepped
Teeth brushed, clutter gone,
I'm going home ""

I love how themes that we've talked about- and that I've reflected on in the past - come up again and again in life. It's truly a reminder of the cyclical nature of things. What a great mantra. Namaste!",UgwdeykepxlmDcbJqEp4AaABAg,1.0,4.0,2020-01-20T21:47:11Z,0.9995307922363281

842.0,"Yesterday you told us to move like we love ourselves.

Two to three days before yesterday I was feeling restless due to painful emotions. I wasn't able to hear the loving words you were spreading because I was a bit blocked. 

A couple of months ago I've set the intention to find peace and compassion within myself as my life's intention. Ever since I've been structuring my life following this intention's pathway. Because structure/routine itself is an important one for the mind's rest. This new year I've also set the intention to have courage, courage to let go, courage to continue, courage to learn to be a bit more still. 

I've been following this structure as the only thing I have to do, no matter the feelings coming along. Showing up on my yoga mat, going to my kung fu lessons and all other lessons and moments I've set out for myself. Each day this week I felt there had been a little bit more space created. Yesterday I was able to grasp again, to understand what you meant by moving like you love yourself. The whole day these words echoed in my mind and I was very grateful for the fact that you had been watering the right seeds in me.

I moved like I loved myself yesterday. Slowly, surely, patiently, lovingly, gently, softly. Each step as important as the last, the next; the one in the now. I'll continue to move like I love myself today, and any other. 
Because I love myself. I am learning each day how it feels to love (myself, as well as others).

This was far too slow for me today so I threw in some planks (side and normal) as my body was craving some instensity.

And! My heels in downward dog touched the floor!!! WHAAAT?!?  

I’m coming to realise that I’d rather show up to the mat and do something, do anything, than break practice and have a greater temptation to break practice again, because of how much it throws me off kilter when there’s no yoga/Adriene in my life.

873.0,"HELLO! 
Makes me allwarm & fuzzy inside reading all these comments :)

I left this as a prompt to reflect on in my journal yesterday and I had a wee bit of resistance. I thoughtabout myself as a child and how I trended to the anxious/introvert side; I thought about how these days, I am generally feeling happy and whole and confident. Sometimes, I fret about doing TOO much work on personal development/inner growth - when I was in a place where I was binging more traditional self-help, it just unconsciously perpetuated the narrative that I wasn't DOING ENOUGH TO BE THE BEST POSSIBLE ME I COULD BE!
Now that I'm writing this out, I can see the connection between Adriene's message at the beginning of the move - What we seek, we already have - and the idea of return. The spirit has everything it needs; and sometimes, the ego gets in the way with the narrative of what we are NOT or what we lack. If we just gently chip away at those patterns, we can then reveal whatever masterpiece has been there, all along. ""Return"" isn't so much about going back to being an older version of ourselves, but guiding us back to a place where we're aligned with our higher selves. 

[speaking of the resistance - i did not journal, but it did dissipate once i actually sat down HERE and found a flow of expression, after a couple false starts/mini-youtube + social media binges. yay! i thought maybe i was ""forcing it""... how often we think we're stuck, when we really just need to let process breathe without the pressure of perfection, profundity, and...some other p-word.]

I also had a mini-""aha!"" moment when I thought about how in the new year, we often focus on behaviors and habits we want to change (often around what we could be doing to be ""better""), whereas yoga encourages us to change our way of being. Much more effective overall, than forcing and muscling our way into becoming a brand-new person -- with that extra ""oomph"" of intention and attention, we can let the process unfold at a more natural, loving pace. 
it's getting later now; I'm happy with how the day went and how I followed through on my intentions, but still haven't done my daily yoga yet! off I go to RESET :) 

[i'm very cheery writing this - hopefully it's just a general mood and i didn't late afternoon OD on green tea]

875.0,"It was my birthday yesterday and I didn't have the time to come to the mat and enjoy this little part of my day. I would be lying if I said I wasn't delaying this practice anytime I looked at the clock... but each day I come back is a reminder of why I've been here for 14 days now, I just feel so good. It allows me to relax and think in a clearer and more helpful way about things, process feelings; I just love it so much, I laugh and feel plainly good. And I'm nowhere near what I would like my life to be like, but your videos have made it less worrying and pendant, when I'm doing this I feel I have time and space and that it is all I need. I hope I can return to discipline, but in a healthy way now... I destroyed my body once and felt proud of it, and even now I sometimes want to go back there because I only remember the outside benefits I got from it, but I know I wasn't happy and... maybe I went all those steps back to where I started because it wasn't the right path and I was meant to be here today, doing this practice and being the slightess bit closer to a good life... trully thank you, Adriene♥",UgzRGvIMWNdjXKJP3x14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-17T02:54:14Z,0.9994219541549683

I think it's fitting that this 30 day journey is called home - when you asked us to think about what we wanted to return to, home (and everything that it represents) is what came to mind.

I find that the body I currently inhabit ,makes some of my poses and movements difficult- hard to slide a leg up when your thigh and stomach are the biggest they've ever been, lol; but Adriene's persistent commentary regarding what feels right for me is so encouraging. I haven't given up! I have found that I can put yoga blocks under my hands and it allows me to cushion my wrists a little more and it gives just enough space for my movement to flow a little easier while still challenging me. Additionally, I was in an auto accident 2 years ago-my back has been in real discomfort for the  past few months especially - peak of discomfort- started doing the 30 day yoga challenge and have felt my back and hips adjust to a better alignment. The pain is nearly gone.  Today I focused on a  return to a state of feeling one with my body rather than feeling my body is the enemy. Thank you for making this community possible, Adriene.

It’s so addictive I feel all my weighty burden were also burned through the process and that’s the real cleanse!

Quick question, are all yoga mats the same dimensions? I try to (roughly) gauge my placement by Adrienne's. I'm super lanky & gangly though, so when I modify, I end up quite a way off. If our mats are different widths, that explains a lot & I can adjust accordingly.

I was talking to my sister before my practice and she was struggling with feel like her old bad habits made her inferior and like she could not grow and endure her day to day task, I literally told her the same advice that Adriene said today well along the lines of it, that it's okay to have  bad days but don't get stuck there, that she had to find the strength to keep going. Adriene had told us this in previous practices last year and that has helped me to stick with my practice and in my day to day life it kept me from giving yup and quitting easily and I thank u Adriene cause it not only helped me but today it helped my sister, this practice was really for us. I want to return to healthier eating habits, I feel like I have dropped the ball on it and just in general become more conscious about my routines and let them be more healthier so that it become a lifestyle rather than just something I am doing for the sake of doing it, you know what I mean.

I embarked on this journey home to me, so I decided to embrace it instead of run from it. My younger brother loved the band Enigma. He introduced the very song that you shared today because he thought I would love it, and I did. Months after, he committed suicide. It was my first experience with total utter devastation. I was 28 at the time, with 3 little girls of my own, but all I wanted was to return to a time in my life when all I had to worry about was what color crayon I was going to use. I didn't want to have to be an adult navigating the shattering of my heart. Today, on the mat, I embraced that 28 year old me and helped us release that deep distrust of life so that we can return, in whatever form and shape it takes...to innocence.

1132.0,"It was a really good practice, I feel really good after each one since the January 2nd ! I'd like to thank you for your help, my New Year resolution was to take care of myself, something that I leave behind for a while…. And this Journey of HOME really helps me to stick to it. Even if I have final exams this month, I take the time for myself to not fall into my usual stress spiral. So this is a big thank !

I just thought this : maybe, at the end of the practice, you could tell us if you have a recommendation about the time we practice the next day ? I means some practices are better in the morning and others during the evening, even if most of them can be done at any time. It is just that sometimes (like today), I can't do this in the Morning (I have to leave home before you publish the video) and I can't make them before the evening, but sometimes the practice is quite energizing and it is not the best before bed. I Don't really know if I'm clear, but I hope so ^^

Anyway, THANK YOU Adriene, for your smile, your kindness, your laugh, that little smile of ""Yeah, one more time, it is hard but you can do it"", those sentences of kindness and enhancement, and all those litlle things (Benji included) that make me stick to this practice ! You seem to be a really good person, and thank you for sharing this goodness with us. And for this introspection, one of those that make sometimes cry and sometimes laugh, but anyway that make feel at peace.

I were doing mostly a child pose, but I felt peace. I also feel bad for me feeling like this, but somehow I got to a little moment of silence where I didn't think about anything. I wanted to return spending time with my friends and family. And I will do that. But right now, I'm gonna go to sleep.

1156.0,What does your heart say when a friend asks you what you want to return to? That sort of threw me for a loop.

1167.0,"Omg! This practice just killed me emotionally. Not only am I super proud of my obvious progress in hip flexibility, but the notion of ‘returning’ really brought home a lot for me. The feelings that came up were ‘returning’ back to childhood, purity of spirit and body, when I listened to myself without trying, when my body knew exactly what to do without me ‘trying’, before all the things that caused trauma that shaped my later life, when everything and myself were just as it were...that’s where I’m returning to. And I LOVED the idea of already being/having everything I want to be/have...just returning to it as oppose to trying to obtain it.

First answer to pop up is ""genuinely trusting people and allowing myself to connect with friends"". I genuinely love people and I am conscious of the love I receive from the universe everyday in small acts of kindness from people I know or strangers but i learned the hard way to stop trusting people and eventually stop expecting real friendships. 
I have an awesome SO who I trust more than anyone else (maybe I used my lifetime social luck to meet this great human being ❤️) but I don't really connect with friends anymore. 
I try to meet new people but no one seems to share my interests irl.
I've been working up a Facebook community idea for a few days now (about Intentional Living) and your question just hit that spot.
Wish me luck on finding my kind of people.

“Where do you want to go back to?”
For me personally, I want to go back to the me who doesn’t pressure myself to do things. The me who doesn’t need to prove herself and doesn’t feel the need to get validation from everyone. The me who always wanted to learn new things without feeling bad for not being good at something right away. 
And most importantly the me who doesn’t overthink everything or takes everything so seriously.

I believe that this is truly helping me save my own life. Thank you Adriene, and namaste.",UgyxeSu0tRyt7Fl0cBF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-15T15:16:50Z,0.9979580640792847

This is something that I want to change although sometimes it gets me frustrated and then the self compassion and self love comes in. During the yoga and meditation practice this morning, I just didn’t feel connected as I would like to feel. Although it makes me frustrated sometimes, because dealing with anxiety and obsessive compulsive thinking you just crave that feeling of connection, Love and peace, it’s the perfect state of relief and healing! And many times before, that’s what made me give up from building these healing habits, not feeling or reaching that state where I find the perfect relief when I’m doing them, but I have to accept it and it’s alright, it’s part of the journey, the process. It’s still loving and healing. Thank you Adriene for being part of my journey home, and thank you to the loving community you’ve created here.

1384.0,"the time that I devote myself to practicing Home is precious. I honor this opportunity that I give myself and I honor myself, Adriane and all participants here.
Today I have got direct synchronicity with the name of the practice and my night dream. 

tonight I dreamed that I gave birth to a New Girl. She is so different and happiness that I experienced in a dream is also different in feelings, new or forgotten.

I remembered that feeling of happiness from another time and space. It was such a multidimensional dream that I still breathe into it.

the most important feeling I have now from this information about the girl is she is free.
and even someone wanted to take her away from me (the reason said to me by a person I needed some rest) I refused.
I was sooooo strong in my decision.

Because the girl brings me such Joy! And there are no issues with the little kid! She is already done in spite she is newborn!
This felt into the dream as a Miracle! And I accepted this quickly. No doubt!

A week ago, I dreamed that I was 9 month prego and that the child would be different, it will be a New Human.
The new story successive unfolds into my night dream state and it is so exciting!

1484.0,"Doing yoga with Adriene has brought me some of my favourite moments over the past few years. Like the time I started laughing to myself while rolling around in Happy Baby. And the time I started crying mid-practice, and saw and heard my tears dropping quietly onto the mat. The time I managed Crow Pose for a few seconds and really felt like I was flying. The time I 'took up space' in Star Pose and realised how much needless energy I have spent in my life trying to make myself smaller and less visible, both physically and mentally. I returned to all this in today's practice. Thank you Adriene, as always. Anyone else have some beautiful yoga memories they'd like to return to today?",UgyM6Zv1ucT1QJNWzL54AaABAg,33.0,1862.0,2020-01-15T06:54:54Z,0.7743918895721436
