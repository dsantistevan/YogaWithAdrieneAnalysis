10.0,"I had a great deal of trouble with so many unbroken boat poses and it seems to be out of proportion to the rest of the Home series. But maybe that's just me. I could do about half of them, and not very smoothly those. It seems way out of possibility that, even with lots more practice, I could ever do Day 6.

34.0,"Hearing ""It's not easy,"" while I was pausing for a break, broke me. Today has been so hard I didn't even think I would get to yoga. I skipped the past two days from exhaustion and I was determined to start back today, and it turned out to be one of those days when it feels like you can't catch a break. Hearing ""it's not easy,"" and ""You're stronger than you think,"" I just cried for the second half of this video. Which obviously made the yoga harder, but y'know.
I spent the final poses praying ""God, I know this is good for me, but it's so hard,"" meaning the yoga and everything going on in life at the same time.

53.0,"Admittedly, I was at first hesitant to start day 6, because of my current bizarre GI issues and I thought 'damn so much focus on core will be a death of me,"" and I wanted to skip into day 7.

However, hesitance got quickly replaced by trust in Adriene and understanding that I am doing this for myself. Ergo, I can just stop if I suddenly feel uncomfortable. I am glad that I stuck with that decision cause I feel better after the practice even though it targets my ""problematic"" zone. 

I am not a doctor so I don't want to arrogantly say that anyone's disease is in their head. But, at least for me (and I think for some other people), psychology - anxiety, in particular, - play a huge role in exacerbating our conditions.

518.0,"Can you add a practice to build stability for those of us with hyper-mobility and ED, or maybe add modifications for us? There are so many options for yoga for those who are not as flexible, but little attention is paid to those of us who are overly flexible, have instability, and constantly are pulling muscles/ligaments. I have so much muscle wastage in my hips and wrists (I pull a muscle every time that I scoop ice cream!), and would love to build stability in those areas, but youtube options are so limited, and doing workouts without modifications for me often end up hurting me.

I'm at day 6 now and for the first time after exercise feeling empowered, centred and loving. You don't always feel this lifting iron. Your guidance videos have been tremendous, my abs are tingling and I feel so much relief across normally tight areas of my body. I'm ready for my day. Aho!

1431.0,"I struggled with this one. I felt sad because the perfectionist in me was saying that I should've done more. But then a bigger part of me says that I shouldn't be too hard on myself. That since I'm starting out it would be harder for me to do certain poses and that's okay. 

I wanted to cry during the practice due to me struggling through the moves but I didn't. I had to pause the video but that's okay. I needed to catch my breath and since it is my practice I honored what my body needed at that moment. 

Yoga reminds me that I can take my own pace and that I can be strong one day and that I can be not so strong  the next. It takes time to realize that sometimes we are being too hard on ourselves.

I struggle so much with confidence and feelings of inadequacy and during those boat poses a lot of those struggles came to the surface. I ended up lying on my back and close to tears for most of that portion of the practice. But isn't that the beauty of yoga? This practice is meant for us to not only become more attuned to our physical state, but our mental and emotional state as well. I am grateful that even though I struggled hard through today's practice, it gave me the space and the safety to explore some of my inner struggles. I plan on returning to Day 6 in a few day's time to see if I can challenge some of the negative voices that found their way into my head today. Until then, I am excited to return back to my mat for Day 7 tomorrow and so very thankful for this beautiful, thoughtful, and compassionate community. <3",UgyyTVMbHnOExEJVUdp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-03-26T14:00:47Z,0.9988859295845032

So instead, on my lunch break I did this practice in my back garden. I paused for a moment as I watched a butterfly fly by.

1746.0,"I just want to share my thoughts about yoga. I used to do home work out (exercise) for the past months and I felt great but I have decided to try yoga because I've read a lot of great things about it and well, I was easily convinced to try it! Working out keeps me alive, alert, awake, and enthusiastic all through the day but gradually, it started to drain me. Letting myself sleep is very hard. There were times when I can't sleep and then it is already 6 am and I haven't slept (probably because I'm still alive, alert, awake, and enthusiastic). Waking up too is very hard 'cos I feel so tired and drained after working out the day before. And so, I've decided to switch to yoga. I initially decided to give it a week to see what it does to me, but now I have decided to do it as long as I can. Sleeping, now, is as easy as 123. I close my eyes for a minute and *boom* I'm asleep. In the morning, if my phone starts to alarm me to wake up, I don't press the snooze button and go back to sleep, instead I wake up, get out from my bed, and feed our dogs. Also, I feel more relaxed and free (?). My breathing is very smooth and my body is now more flexible. Discovering this Youtube channel is definitely a blessing and I thank you Ms. Adriene for doing this. Keep doing what you do best and I hope you live a very good life!

Since then, I can now do most hip openers without having an outburst of emotion. However, THIS practice made me rage again.

And I finally realise why I don't like downward dog, it's because I'm not used to the ""in between"" stage of things. I like the heavy lifting like planks etc. And the ""easy"" stuff like child's pose. I like the all or none stuff, but most of life actually lies in the in between stages. It's not always about the highly charged moments. It's the in between, every day moments that make up life. And that's what yoga has taught me today.

I'm not ready for a six count when you start at three.  -There are extended meditation/laying down at the start, then very little warm up or stretching and then quite strenuous stuff like all core for the remainder.

However, with Day 6, I finally had a break through. I actually started crying halfway through the boats, and I felt so defeated. I don't have a flat tummy and I'm not able to reach my hands around my thighs, and even when I was doing the modified version, it was hard. And I thought about giving up, but then I pulled myself together and finished the last few boats. And then, this wonderful instructor, said that this wasn't easy, just like things off the mat aren't easy, and then she said that I killed it, even if I struggled. And Adriene, you'll never know how much that meant to me. Being kinder and more loving to myself is something I struggle with, even though I've been working on my journey for a while, but I think with todays class, I realize that I should do a better job.

And in some ways it was. Til the up and down boats which my larger body just couldn't do. Tried to modify but it got overwhelming the feeling of failure again. Was crying at the end.

And my fiance had watched me crying at the end, and was crying too. He held me and told me how proud he was and how strong I am. How I'm his brave and beautiful girl.

I don't know yet if I am going to push myself to get caught up or if I am just going to try to keep doing a video a day and just, well, be a bit behind. This one was SO DIFFICULT for me. Every time I tried to extend out my torso & legs low to the floor then pull myself back up with my core muscles I couldn't & I had to use a hand to help myself get back into the curled upright position. So I cut myself a little slack & just held the boat pose I'm familiar with (but that still gets difficult after a long enough hold) for as long as my core muscles could hold it. My legs were shaking. It was life. I love the reminder in (I think) almost every video in this series so far that we are always home because home is our bodies. I need that. I feel kinda bad that I couldn't do the main/longest sequence in the video (the one I mentioned not being able to do earlier) but, at the same time, my cobra has gotten a lot higher, easier & more graceful - so there is something to be proud of.

I have a question for you regarding this day-6 practice. As a mom of three I am familiar with diastasis recti. In fact, I hear it happens to almost every mom. Also most moms are unfamiliar with the fact they have it and attribute their postpartum bellies to body fat or some sort of ""body transformation"". Its severity can differ from person to person. As I heard, doing frontal planks and frontal crunches can really worsen the condition.  Could you please comment on that, and maybe address the issue in your future videos. I would really think it's important to remind women with kids of it all the time, because it cannot be overemphasised:) I believe. And isn't it the majority of your subscribers? Thanks!

2592.0,"So.. I was recently diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my hips - the left one in particular has been flared up badly since I moved homes end of September. I'm an athlete - an avid mountain biker and outdoor enthusiast - and a self-employed single mother of two. I am only 46 and I am having difficulty putting my socks on in the morning, am waking up in the night and early morning with my left side in spasm. I have had chronic back/hip/knee pain all my life, but have always found a way to stay active. My physio once told me that I am an athlete stuck in a princess's body. Well, my body has taught me that there are parts of me that are quite broken/crippled, but other parts of me that are super rad and badass. I like to spend as much time feeling badass as possible, of course. But this yoga practice has been a way for me to embrace the broken parts of myself and meet myself where I am at. My intention for this practice is to love myself exactly as I am, even when I have to modify or opt out of a pose because it moves me into pain. Five days in, I noticed a reduction in my pain and increase in mobility/flexibility that has helped me be more comfortable throughout my day and especially in the evening when I tend to get quite sore again and my entire left leg from my lower back/glutes all the way down to my ankle have been going into spasm. This practice is helping. Often, but not always, a certain pose releases tears and I feel myself being cleansed of pain, letting go of whatever crap my body has been holding onto. I have never committed to yoga as a daily practice before. Too slow, quiet, gentle for me, perhaps? Not anymore. Love to everyone who has found the courage to meet themselves on the mat every day, no matter what, and huge gratitude to you, Adriene, for creating this beautiful space and guiding our practice.  xo",UgxIKQ4gnz124WECyWF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-09T06:48:51Z,0.9208754301071167

2773.0,"Almost cried too many times today. I honestly have had so many injuries in my body over the last year (back pain. RSI, knee spain, strained muscle in my foot) and I was scared to do this 30 days. I knew deep down that it would be a good thing but I was scared I would push myself too far in frustration with how my body has been failing me and make an injury worse, but this whole thing is making me stronger, wiser and more respectful of my body (in waves, but no one is perfect. I'm improving). 

I know that I failed my body by not listening to it over the past little while and thats why it has been getting injured. Whilst days like this make the muscles hurt where I have been injured in the past, I know they are just getting stronger and maybe, just maybe, they wont hurt like they have before if I keep pushing thorugh. Today was the hardest for my back and hip creases, because my core is so weak, but I did it. I almsot cried trying to get through it, but I did and then cried with my little affirmation at the end from Adriene. This is hard but my muscles are stronger and looser than at the beginning, my foot strain (currently in recovery) has been getting a bit overworked, but the overall benefit is helping so much with fixing everything as a while. 

I still feel angry with myself for not being able to do better, but mentally im getting much better at pushing thorugh that. What a journey this has been so far.

I also discovered the places where I was working harder than I needed to, and I realized that it is okay to be at whatever level you are at in the practice. I was trying to do the most ""advanced"" of all the poses and it was really just holding me back. Wow!! An amazing day!!

I'll have to come back to day 6 once I finish the 30 days to try the boat poses again to see the improvement steady and consistent work and effort will make (I was boating as much as my weak abs could take so I'd say I got about 40% of what Adriene's abs got from this workout, which is great for getting back into yoga and exercise but still annoying in a self critical sense, even though I have come so far to be able to do that much)

3118.0,"I went into this practice kind of dreading it but through pushing myself I was surprised at what came up. For the first time in a long time I got emotional during  a yoga practice. I used to hold a lot of shame for crying, especially if I didnt know why I was upset in the first place but in this moment I sat with myself and stayed present with what I was feeling. I was fearful going into this practice but I was very humbled by the fact that I had to let myself take a break to honor the emotions flowing through me. Before this practice I was singing to relieve stress and I feel that it opened my heart up to the lesson this practice gave: it is okay to need a break, to not be perfect and I am safe in honoring myself. Believe it or not the Titanic reference helped me a lot because being asked if I trust was just what I needed in order to embody grace. I thought about giving up in the middle of this practice. I thought about getting down on myself for having emotions out of habit and that fact that I didnt is truly evidence of my tremendous growth. I am proud of myself for honoring these organic emotions.

3188.0,I was so nervous going into this because (as this is my 3rd year doing this) ab day is my LEAST favorite by far and always leaves me feeling discouraged.

I'll be honest...core work is my nemesis (I'm sure I'm not alone) and after the past two days, I had doubts about how much energy I could put into today's practice ESPECIALLY since it focused on core. Yesterday I was in the DMV for SEVEN (7) HOURS! Wish that was an exaggeration. And today I had to open my shop and figure out a new register system that turned up plenty of issues needing to be resolved. And then there's the after-work housekeeping (bills, pet care, errand, dinner, and literal housekeeping lol). I've felt mentally spent but now, though still pretty exhausted, I feel re energized and just invigorated in my soul. I showed up with all of you, pushed myself to keep my hands out because I knew I could do it, allowed myself a break with as much compassion I would give my best friends, loved and celebrated my body for all it's strength (underneath whatever fabulous curves I've been blessed with haha!).

3279.0,"I'm hoping this sharing will be encouraging to some.  This is my 4th 30-days with Adriene, and the first where I have felt at ease with each practice.  Doesn't mean perfect; doesn't mean easy; but rather:  an ease; a knowing I would be able to ""do"" the practice in whatever way that meant for me.  Along the way, I had come to drop the struggle -- and my body and mind learned to truly partner with my breath..  And, today, that all meant that I was able to do this core practice fully with grace.  It does happen.


By the way, I will be 65 next month and in March 2018 I had a life-threatening accident.  Short story I was like Humpty Dumpty, except that my body did all come back together again.  With a combination of  PT and yoga (I only do Adriene's yoga practices), I went from debilitating pain in shoulders, hip, wrists, knees . . . (you get it) to being pain free a little more than a year later.  As I had a crash course on really listening to and being kind to my body as I rebuilt, I emerged both stronger and gentler.  I had to give up the pushing through and struggle because every time I didn't, my body spoke up with a vengeance.  


What worked for me was:  kindness, gentleness -- and commitment.  Love to each of you along your personal journey.",UgxnE3nTCk94j4kE_bd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-07T21:13:20Z,0.9973607659339905

3348.0,"HELLO! a bit on day 5 and day 6 --
day 5 was sort of ""squeezed in"" between 2 things, and I was surprised by how active the practice was, compared to the theme...still, the theme of ""soften"" certainly served for day 6! phew! those side crunch-y things... DEAD. d-e-d, DEAD. I read another comment on here about the ego getting in the way today - yep, those silly little brain demons, saying that I should be doing better at ""keeping up,"" showed up (their presence especially insidious as I work off-the-mat to cultivate stronger self-belief!).
but I guess sometimes you show up, get humbled, and you receive a choice to ""soften"" into self-compassion. :) as well as transmute the pain into fire, and an invitation to connect with our life force! 


one thing that Adriene said that resonated with me during this practice as we got into the cool-down: 
""some more love, a different kind of love"" 

as self-love and self-care become more dominant narratives/messages (yay!), I always appreciate the reminder that everything we do CAN be in service to that self-love practice, even if it feels painful in the moment, and that we can bring an intention of love into it all... for me, sometimes, there's a delicate balancing act between nurturing and indulgence, and before this, I was feeling some drudgery and resistance about the things I have to do today and could feel myself teetering back into old habits (""well, I already went on a run and if I do yoga, then I can just like... relax, right?"") but now I'm ignited to go about my day, with love and softness :) thanks, Adriene, and namaste!",UgyFy0kxHMK9Qj400Ap4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-07T20:08:23Z,0.9850364923477173

I saw my core jumping while in boat pose. Rising and lowering in boat pose was difficult. Not gonna lie, I struggled. I modified. I approached today nervous, but ready to work. And during it, I thought I couldn't keep going with it, but I stuck to it. I did forget my breath here and there, but I managed to get it done.


Everyone who has made it this far, congratulations. You've done an amazing job. I'm proud of you. Even if you've modified and had to do things at your own pace or had to substitute - you've proven that you are strong and wonderful.

I've been practicing with you daily for the last 3 weeks. I woke up this morning and it is remarkable how great my body feels. I simply love it. I had to idea I could feel like this. I also never knew one could feel so many different energies through yoga ie I could feel the difference in this workout as opposed to the one yesterday. A little thing that I think is special is the number of times I smile during the routine at your suggestions. That is surely special. Your call to have fun is wonderful.

3638.0,"I've been doing yoga for 5 years now, and I'm here on this channel since the True. I do joga more or less regulary (3-5 times a week), but I've been struggling for the past few month due to my depression. I've been really hurt and betrayed and in pain for quite a time, so for November and December I mostly avoided practises that could be hard -- these with vinyasas and planks, so I lost a lot of my strength. I'm better now and I've decided to commit to Home and daily meditation. Yet today was a really hard session for me. I took a lot of modifications -- something I didn't usually do earlier. I miss my strength, consistancy and peace of mind. I began to cry nearly at the half of the video and I didn't stop. It really hit me when Adriene said that I killed it, because I didn't do well as I had done before. I know I shouldn't be too hard on myself, but I'm just sorry I'm not that good anymore. I hope I'll get back there, back home in time. Thank you for your inner light and strength, your guidance was with me even in the hardest times for whole two years now, so it's the third one.

One of my main issues with my body is my upper thighs / groin area. When I have my legs out straight or bent in those boat poses there's so much pressure on that area that it gets very tight and starts to pull if I keep them off the ground for too long. Even just lying down and having my legs float above the floor is a lot of pressure in the groin that I struggle to hold it.

I have been told by lots of people in my life that i really mentally beat myself up if I don't or cant do something perfectly. It has always been an issue but it popped up again after my mum was diagnosed terminal 3 years ago, it is one of the things I worked very hard on with a counsellor after her diagnosis as I decided that I needed to get rid of some negative coping mechanisms to be able to support her and my family properly. I have felt it slipping in again recently over the last 6 months and during that practice I reaaaaaally felt myself starting to beat myself up during the first round of boats... 'why am I so bad at this' 'I should be fitter than this' I'm rubbish, I can't finish these.' I got angry with myself that I couldn't do it without extra ground support... BUT then Adriene Said' change your mind about it' and I remembered all the lovely support I've had here, and something hit and I started sobbing... And I finished them all! Yes it wasn't super yogi, I'm not super yogi... But I am here and doing it... Which should be enough so I'm going to make it enough.

4075.0,If this practice wasn't a big reminder that I should finally get myself an appointment at a physiotherapist I don't know what is. I've had my hips crack whenever I did any of these leg raises all my life. But I feel like with all that lowering from boat pose both of my hips cracked so extremely loud every single time that my neighbors are for sure awake now. The thing is it doesn't hurt in the least that's why I never really worried about it. It's just an unpleasant feeling because I can also feel my femur hitting some kind of resistance in my hip socket and then releasing with a crack. Not sure how healthy that might be in the long term.,UgwBilBoBuq56z610Ex4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-07T08:15:38Z,-0.9911831617355347
