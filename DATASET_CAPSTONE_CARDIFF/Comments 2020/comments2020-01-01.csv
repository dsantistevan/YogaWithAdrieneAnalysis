2.0,"Just finished an older 30 Days version and found it very beneficial for regaining strength and flexibility that was laying dormant. Took a day off before embarking on this one as I had doubled up a few days in the previous one trying to gain too much too quick and regressed a little in the hip flexibility I had achieved. Note to self, slow and steady. My objectives here are to eliminate lower back pain, gain body alignment, synergy, strength and flexibility and be mindful of every activity. I find conscious thought of the tight area while stretching really works. Relaxing the tension with thought and focused breathing, I can feel the release. I am so much more nimble throughout my daily life, sitting cross legged more often than not, even at work. Flipping light switches with my feet. Belly has gone down quite a bit as I have changed my eating habits too. Most challenging things were the balance postures which I thought were my strength, spine rolling and I Lulued my lemons in the closed knee child's pose a couple of times. Super impressed with progress overall after just 30 days at 58 years of age. I'll be doing hand stands by spring!

In my final rounds of breathe and shavasana, I feel so incredibly connected to my higher self, and to what feels like ""the truth"". No other time in my day do I feel like this. It made me so aware of how quickly modern day life can zap me out of this connection. I'm so grateful to have found yoga to use as a tool and a morning guide to pave the day ahead. I am beginning to bring awareness to my breathe and ""how does my body feel right now"" during times of stress and tension throughout the day.

So I didn't get much time or many chances to feel recognize anything because I was to busy catching up. I need to watch the video to know what I must do because the vocal instructions are not clear enough to me (several times I cought myself doing something else entirely then she was when I only tried to follow instructiosn trough voice.) So my neck was not straight because I needed to watch the video.  Maybe this 30 days of yoga is better for people with some previous experience with some of the poses already. I need a slower pace. Still I will try to finnish the 30 days. Maybe those 30 days will help me learn some of those poses and then at some point I can redo the 30 days with the prior experience and get out of it what others surely are based on the comment section.",UgzPQJ_rdBd6qK453aJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-11-13T16:57:44Z,-0.9992924928665161

459.0,"Hi everyone! I just need to get some things off my chest right now. 
I'm pregnant for the first time (week 16) and it has been really difficult so far. I am quite isolated, in lock down, because of COVID, unable to see friends and family other than my spouse. I've also had pretty bad pregnancy symptoms, non-stop nausea and tiredness, for months now. It's much harder than I anticipated. I've been really sedentary for the past two months, because even getting up was difficult and caused me to retch. 
I'm usually quite active, I walk a lot, hike, run, do yoga very often and climb... but it's really hard for me to start over now... I think I'm a bit depressed because of the symptoms, the inactivity, and the isolation... Also, even though I'm very happy and I've been looking forward to be a mom, this pregnancy was not planned, and me and my spouse are both still students, so there's been some other negative emotions involved as well... I thought I still had a couple of years before becoming a mom to get ready psychologically and feel stable. It's very scary, honestly. 
Now, I'm still exhausted, but my nausea is starting to go away a bit, so I'm trying this out. Yesterday, I redid yoga for the first time in 2 months, and it felt very good. I faced my fears of not being ready to become a mom and cried a lot, and held myself. Hopefully I can win over my inner demons and make it to day 30. Send me good vibes. I think I will need it.

I've been taking breaks from working on my big screen by scrolling on my little screen like some Wall-E nightmare. Constant body aches and trouble sleeping made me realize something needs to change. Yesterday I came across your channel and your 30-day yoga video sets and realized that if I could just get started, the one-a-day format would likely be enough motivation to keep me going.

920.0,"Darn it Adriene! I just finished your 2015 '30 days of yoga' videos, managed to make it through without shedding a tear. And then here, day 1, BAM! Cried throughout the whole video. Recognise. I recognised frustration, and I don't like feeling frustrated (who does, eh?), and that creates tension and sadness. And at the same time, at the end of the video, you mentioned: connect to your true/best self, and recognise it in others. It's so easy to stay in the frustration, the sadness, I can make myself into a victim of my own life. But in the end it's more helpful to recognise I DO have control, every morning again. I can't change what happened in the past and the future is yet unborn. ""Therefore, the present moment is the only real moment and it's only in the present moment that a conscious contact with God can be found!""¬†Every morning I have the choice to focus on what I CAN control, on the things that ARE present in my life, in the relationships I DO have with people around me. I struggle with that sometimes, but it will more positively affect the world around me when I learn to recognise my sadness, allow it time to be present, to be able to release it, to make space for joy and love. Have a great day, whoever reads this.

Sending lots of love to everyone going through a personal journey as well as this one from the here in the UK, what a lovely community to be a part of.

Adriene is like a breath of fresh air, she will literally be your everyday yoga buddy and friend, Thank you Adriene for this beautiful journey in such a small time I could see a huge difference physically and emotionally ,for example I got to reach my heels to the ground in downward dog! , something that seemed impossible before and I was amazed that it happened , so thank you for those small accomplishments we did that now feel like we have moved mountains.
lots of love and support from Egypt :)

1030.0,"Doing this yoga practice for the 4th time.
 First time was in January during my entrance exams and finals, this helped me a lot with stress and to relax in between study sessions. I actively began to apply Adrienne's advice in day to day life, the most powerful one being  : ""let your breath do the work for you."" In February during a revision class I suddenly experienced intense stomach ache, normally I would have immediately voiced my discomfort but this time my first response was to concentrate on controlled, deep breathing. While in the infirmary, I started slow breathing exercise, and I could hear Adrienne's voice saying ""just one more, you got this."" 
Hearing that, I continued to do so. It was during this time I experienced my first ""awakening moment."" After ending my first whole 30 day practice, I didn't feel divine or awakened or anything, I wondered how come I am not experiencing any of those moments other people keep commenting under every video. But after a few days of not continuing yoga, I realised how much more flexible I have become, and how doing yoga in the evenings, after the day almost ended, helped me to unwind. It wasn't to feel anything special or connected to the divine being, but to myself and my body. It was about calmness and serenity and peace.
Each time I repeat this routine, I get better and feel better. Hearing your words of encouragement, I feel amazing, not immediately, but when I am in pain, it is your voice I hear. The infirmary incident had me placing my full trust in you. I could only hear your words in my head telling me I got this.
Thank you so much for helping me achieve this, Adrienne‚ù§Ô∏è

To anyone starting/doing this practice, welcome home! So happy for you and your journey. Don't worry if you're not experiencing anything major like the people in the comment section, this practice won't give you sudden enlightenment or truth of thr universe, but this will help in you achieving true calmness and loving your body better. Like Adrienne says, move like you love your body‚ù§Ô∏è

I am now 67 years old. Discovering Yoga with Adrienne has restored my enthusiasm for a regular practice, offering me a sense of inner balance that I value. I sometimes supplement the classes with additional poses: inversions or range of standing postures etc. Sometimes not. That is the beauty of these classes: they are entirely accessible, for both less and more experienced yogis. Each to their own level. I appreciate the discipline, guidance and variation of instruction, and feel enriched by the quality of serenity Adrienne brings to her teaching.

1274.0,"if anyone's got doubts, stick with it. Get your best friend to do it with you. 3 years back I did 2 30 day yoga challenges with Adriene. I was roommates with my friend, and that was the key to success. Accountability. 

If he didn't want to do yoga, I would convince him to show up for himself. Same for me, and we would have a really relaxing time doing this. Once I got into doing this daily, I was excited to show up for myself simply because it felt so good. Like a physical sensation good. I was able to greatly increase my strength,  discipline and flexibility. 

fast forward to living on my own, I stopped. My yoga mat was too thin and would hurt very badly doing it on tile. I splurged on like a $50 yoga mat, and that fixed it. I'm going full speed ahead with this since I've done it before, and I know it is very powerful.

1336.0,"Constructive criticism time. 

You don‚Äôt break down the language for the newbies. You have a hard time explaining what you are doing and how you modify movements in the downward dog for example. 

Furthermore there seems to be an awful lot of filler conversation. People that I have seen try these exercises tend to lose interest due to too much pointless pondering of existence conversation and too little breakdown of the movements. 

This is one of the reasons why I appreciate Gaiam‚Äôs instructional exercise videos, because they treat you like you aren‚Äôt a Yogi with 10 years of experience, they break down the movements, explain the positions as well as the tensions and sensation you will PHYSICALLY feel in your body, provide multiple camera angles of the positions ( which in addition helps prevent injury, an exercise professional should know better ) and they don‚Äôt ramble on about inconsequential background noise thoughts. 

There are my two cents regarding this series. It may work for some but video views do not translate into positive experiences. What about likes, aren‚Äôt they a good indicator? Not really, not unless you have a million likes. Right now you have less likes than people that have died globally from Covid-19. Not a good indicator. 

For the people having trouble understanding the language and techniques, try Gaiam‚Äôs series instead. They instruct you like its your first time and are very patient.",UgwA7iQ6P_F8Ao1ioet4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-18T16:16:47Z,-0.978935718536377

1441.0,"Hi, Adrian! My name's Nadezda, from Russia, 20 years. It's my first time here, and I don't even know if you'll see my comment but I really want to write this.
I came to yoga just today and only 'cause my body was too exhausted for any real workout. I don't like my body, and at the quarantine I decided loss a lot of weight and become stronger. But I'm so weak so today I understood any workout won't be useful for me now. And so I came to yoga, only for calming myself - yes, I work every day, I'm doing well. And I wanted only doing useful stuff for my body, that's all. But then, I found your channel, watched previous video - Day 0 - and read the comments.
Actually, I never gave any chance for yoga to become something more than just physical activity. And when I read so many comments from your video I was wondering why people wrote all this. Did they really feel that way after doing just a yoga? I don't understand it (sorry for that). And I thought - maybe if I try I'll feel myself better? I just need consider this not only as physical help, for my body, but more as mental help? 
Yeah, I decided to try it. Today was the first time when I actually listened all you said. It was 45-minute video but when it ended my first thought was ""Wait, what? That was only 10 minutes!"" And I never could do dawnward dog right, and today I couldn't do it either but I was so close to it!
I don't really know. Maybe I shouldn't write this. Maybe I just imagined these things myself. My uncertainty is killing me. I realized if I focus on my breath I suddenly start panicking and to the end of today I made myself distracting from breathing, to bring it back to automatic process. It's ridiculous when I'm reading it but it's true. I know I have inner troubles and maybe it's connected. I don't know, maybe I'm waiting a miracle from yoga. I don't know should I write comments to every video to see how the things will change or not.
But I know that at least I will try.
Thanks and sorry for this long comment. Maybe I'll write on Day 2.",UgzLG-3Fc_jzIXOIZux4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-11T08:15:08Z,-0.9966991543769836

I'm finding myself facing tremendous resistance to restrictions that the world faces today.  I knew that some time this year I would be returning to the HOME series to discover something else within myself, so today I find that I've returned to overcome my resistance to change and the need to feel in control.  I've chosen to practice in the morning... Something to which I've been resistant because I feel that is when my body is most resistant.  This time I hope my return HOME will soften my resistances in my body and my mind... That I will soften into the changes of my venture into Namaste at home.  I just wanted to thank you, Adriene for your gentle guidance towards finding the light in myself....

To ease the anxiety and give myself some love so that I can spread spread spread kindness and love to others. (It's funny, I used to be so skeptical when people who were passionate about it said how good it felt. I'm not a flexible person, and even basic poses are challenging for me). But recently, I've dabbled in it a bit, and found that as long as I truly put effort in--moving my body with my breaths even when I can't fully do a pose, I HAVE gained this sense of awareness with in my body. I feel looser, I feel more conscious when I bend down to the ground or stretch up to reach a cupboard. And I do believe that these breaths and thoughts help ease my anxiety. I am so happy that I was able to do this practice today!! I woke up this morning feeling kind of sad, and my awareness of this made me actually get emotional during this session :'). I don't know.

I was really gratefully she pushed me to get a couple of cushions to sit on at the beginning instead of force myself to do it like the expert! The hardest was holding the downward dog for so long.

My hope throughout this journey is to improve strength and flexibility, but also something that provides structure to my days. I've been trying to do this thing for a while with clean, healthy eating, but the lunch prep takes almost an hour, and then need to exercise. I thought, this month, lets really go on a journey. Let's do the food prep, eat clean and make sure that what I eat is nourishing; but let's also move in a way that is kind to myself, reminds me to be present and creates peace while I try to also improve the other areas of my life.

1999.0,"Yesterday I finished the other 30 days challenge, I left a comment saying how important this challenge was for my mental and physical health. Today I had the biggest panic attack of my life at work, I couldn't breathe, I cried my eyes out, and all the muscles of my body / face were paralyzed for like 15 minutes.
When I got home I was ready to do an intense, really athletic yoga session just to get it all out. But instead of that you decided to start this new challenge by doing this amazing 40 minutes practice and at first I was frustrated cause I really wanted a massive, sweaty session and now that I'm finished I'm even more thankful cause I feel like you healed my soul and helped me get through this day.

2022.0,"Thank you Adriene,

Today's practice have shown me that I can trust myself and my home. 
This practice went together with a lot of tears, tears of sadness, tears of true gratefulness, to feel myself ~ my own experience,
to feel the earth, How connected Iam and we are with the Earth.. and tears of actually realising that Iam standing up for my truth as a human being by committing to Yoga is really just committing to myself. It feels a true commitment of coming home ~ to my own heart and the total of my very being. It feels as an opening, a new door, entering and welcoming the new into my life.  

This practice today transformed me completely as Iam now walking with much more confidence, awareness and much more grounded in my body and through my space. 

I feel so so so SO grateful and Iam thanking you for being this beautiful guidance and gift you are.
Much love and light.

The pain was really in my shoulders. The pain started pretty early on and by midway through I couldn‚Äôt bear it anymore. What should I do? I haven‚Äôt been able to workout in any other way so I was hoping yoga would help build a strong foundation for me to move forward.

2261.0,"Just completed Day 1. Slow to start this particular journey, but today was the perfect day to start. Been very will for almost three weeks now and it's been pushing me to my limits of patience and graceful acceptance. Felt the bite of frustrations, fears and anxieties begin to break the skin, and this time, instead of my body saying no, as it has for the past while, my body said a (feeble) but resounding yes. Yes to this journey of health and healing. Yes to abundance. Yes to self-love. Yes to self-honesty. Yes to facing the next leg of this soul-journey with more openness, trust and willingness to let go of the old and co-create the beautiful life of service and connection that is beginning now. Yes to life. 

Love to all others out there journeying through the dark nights.

I took my first yoga class less than 1 year ago.    I was 56 years old, with a chronic back problem and was not at all flexible.   I was nervous and didn't think I would be able to do it.   Roll forward many months, I take that class twice a week and and do 1 (sometimes 2) of your videos 3-4 days a week.  The yoga keeps me moving, manages the chronic pain and has me feeling great.    Frankly, I'm addicted.   I love your videos and cant thank you enough for the impact you've had on my life.

I had a rough personal journey in 2019 since April (things are finally smoothing out a bit) and you helped me along the way.  Now I'm moving to another state with just a speckle of diversity and im freaking out but with your yoga im learning the inside conditions is all that counts. You are helping me develop a true connection with my  body. Every morning (sometimes evening)  I begin with meditation and then your yoga session. It gives me time to tune in with my body and rediscover it. I can't tell you how many times I self diagnosed myself with dehydration or lack of sleep with your yoga. I just wouldn't have taken my body any notice or even bother to think with common sense that I need to implement more well being and healthy habits into my life but your lessons help me be conscious.

I have a /really/ hard time getting myself on the mat. I‚Äôve been playing a cat and mouse game with my yoga practice for almost two years. No matter how good the practice feels, as soon as I start to make some kind of progress or added flexibility, I begin to run away from yoga and health. It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm self sabotaging because deeply I‚Äôm fearful of a life where I‚Äôm healthy and flexible, happy and confident. Because I‚Äôm so attached to this identity, it‚Äôs become the path of least resistance to ~accept~ myself this way. I‚Äôm tired of giving up though. I am following through with this. I know it‚Äôs Jan 3rd (now 4th) but I just rolled out of bed after continuous scrolling and avoidance of yoga, and encouraged myself to just see what happens if I sit and watch this video. (To which of course I completed the sequence.) 
I completed the yoga for transitions video the same day I watched your day 0 HOME video, and I just completed this. Tomorrow I will complete day 2.

At the first downward dog, I felt reallycrappy - everything felt so stiff and not right, i could only hold on for seconds. I felt so terrible and continued anyway.. Then at the 2nd Downward Dog it felt pretty Okay! it wasnt as bad as the first time?! and as the training goes on I felt even better and stronger. So I'm here wantin to share my experience and realized that there a many people having similar feelings and thoughts like me.. and are still continueing.

I wanted to say that I am very excited about these thirty days of home practice, and I am so grateful to have found this space. 2019 was one of the most challenging of my life, and while I'm under no illusions that all can be fixed at once, finding YWA and slowing growing a daily practice is one of the most valuable discoveries I made that year, and that I take with me into this next year, and decade. Practicing at home, but still with a feeling of connectivity to this community has been immensely helpful when I have felt isolated yet unable to leave my own home. It has helped me not to fear looking inwards, but being open to what I might find there, and to deal with whatever I encounter.

3125.0,"Since this was all about recognising...
It has been a very long time since I hopped on the yoga mat to do something more that a bit stretch for my back. This past year has been hard, rough, complicated, heavy, it had made me cry over and over again and I think I will carry part of this in 2020. At the same time, I kept running not toward, but from everything, afraid of standing still and crying again. And here on the yoga mat I have to admit, the first 10/15 mins were so frustrating. I kept thinking how slow it was, how I was doing nothing, how I was wasting time... But I kept myself from skipping forward, and I made it to the end.
Thank you Adriene for keeping me company while a rediscover myself

3221.0,"I've been trying on and off to do more regular practice with Adriene's videos for years; this year I'm trying the 30 day journey! Since I have repetitive stress injuries, chronic illness, and an otherwise non-typical body, I really appreciate Adriene's approach, as it very rarely makes me feel worthless or shamed in any way for not being able to fit myself into a standard asana. 


Today was definitely hard for me. Even accounting for being several months rusty, I had way more pain than I expected in my wrists and arms in the first segment of tabletop/cat/cow/downward dog, and had to take brief stretch breaks and try again to get alignment right. That, at least, is probably due to the abuse my hands take during holiday gift crafting season. 


Between the first and second plank somewhere, though, I had to just collapse stupidly for a minute, catch my breath, and then take a kneeling seat for a few more poses before I could join back in. I'm a bit apprehensive about the fact that the mention that this series will pick up the pace came in right about that time :/

I honestly was a little nervous to start over again, knowing that I won‚Äôt be able to jump right back into Crow. But Adriene is always so welcoming and reminds us to constantly accept where we are now. That made this practice so much easier. 

So thank you for being there from the start to the start over. And thank you for starting us with such a loving practice. It was the first time in a really long time that I ‚Äúremembered‚Äù that I do have I higher self & that self deserves much more love and attention. üíï

You and your gentle nature have kept me coming back and saved me when I needed it most. Second, you share a first name with the love of my life (bf, Adrian of 4+ years). This HOME series is ESPECIALLY timely and meant to be because after many months of saving and stressing, we finally moved into our own place. A rental, but our first HOME none the less. You are a vibrant soul and you inspire me to be the best human possible. Thanks for helping us understand the importance of self love and finding what feels good.

3825.0,"I'm glad I knew a little bit about yoga from years before, otherwise I would not go on with ""home"". I've grown fat and lazy and want to take this chance to start my journey of getting back into shape. I love the idea of ""home"", but it is pretty fast-paced and some of the stuff was not doable with my weight. I had to interrupt so often: To look at the screen, if I was doing everything the right way or because something was starting to cause pain. Fortunately I'm quite flexible and know a few changes to the positions that will help me get the wanted effect without putting too much strain onto my joints. So yes, I will go on. But this is definitely not for overweight beginners. Maybe a little recommendation to chose some easier videos would be nice, so noone will get hurt or - what may be even worse - discouraged.

I've let the practice of yoga go for quite a while, and other factors made it so that I haven't carefully moved my body in a long time. So it was so beautiful to come back. 
In the part when we were asked to soften in an area where we are tight, I could feel a big heavy feeling inside softening a bit. I am grieving over 10 years of dissociation, and how that has influenced my life, my being. In that practice i could soften a bit, and allow the sadness to be there. To be part of me <3.

My mind was all over the place, as it always is; so many thoughts etc. Therefore, I recognize that I very easily get lost. I could not go into the 1st downward dog while pedaling the feet (the rest of the practice felt great, anyway!!!!): I recognized that my neck hurt and was too tense for me to even try and that is OKAY!!! I recognized that there can be bad, awful days but that good, happy days happen as well. I recognized that not everything is an end. Finally, I loved the ""corpse pose"" at the end, I felt calmer and proud for making it today. That feeling and the music made me feel like maybe, it's time for me to go back home.

From the first second I found sitting so rigidly challenging whereas at the end of last year's 30 Days of Yoga set that wasn't the case. What I didn't find myself doing was sweating at Adriene and calling her awful, awful names when she wouldn't release us from poses. That may come later, this is only day one.

I didn't mind the tightness this time around so much and I for everything I lost between this year and last I managed to hold onto downward dog which escaped me for weeks last year.

I was hoping either you or someone here in the comments could tell me about some modifications to poses you use in your videos to avoid placing weight on my injured wrist but still feel like I‚Äôm getting a good practice, or maybe potentially demonstrate in a future video?

Since then I have been sharing my mornings with you, often the first voice I hear. I look to you as a mentor and teacher. I have been a Montessori Primary teacher for 20 years now and have been incorporating dance, creative movement, and yoga into my classroom from the start. Now as I slowly close my school and a huge chapter of my life I am becoming drawn to a different sort of nurturing career which in large part would be yoga. My question and I hope you can help with some guidance and perspective, is what sort of training I should seek out. Of course if you are training teachers, sign me up lady! but, alas, I don't see you offering that so is there some direction you can point me in? Or any FWFG peps have a training that really resonated with you in a more down to earth YWA type way?

4552.0,"I recognize my limitations so that I can work on them üôè There was a famous exchange between Bruce Lee and one of his students where the latter called the former lucky to be blessed with his talents, thus convincing himself that he could never achieve anything great. But Lee shared some of his many flaws that only he was aware of himself: his eyesight wasn't that great, one leg was shorter than the other, etc., and how he overcame them: hr started using contacts so that he appeared more like an action hero in movies (getting a role as Chinese man, let alone a leading role, was unheard of back then because of all the racism and sterotypes) he used his longer leg as his leading leg in fights, and all of his rejection to fuel his ambition of being one of the highest and most popular action actors of all time.

I noticed that one of the limitations that I kept glossing over is that my hands have trouble touching the ground evenly in the low lunges. For some reason today, I was like ""why don't I just use the blocks?""

Gratitude on a first way and very good and nice feeling on lunges half split and forward fall !! Does those ""split postures"" relate good to the homing process ?

Thank you for that skill and the amazing words you use all along the practice (perfectly teached) 
Just one thing : when you say right then you do right and if I just clinch my eyes to the video it takes me out of practice to see you on your right (the other right for me haha) 
Is it on purpose ? 
I'll surely get used to it in time if all the classes are made like this :)

4930.0,"This day's theme was pretty relevant to me, though maybe in a different way I had expected. After maybe 1,5 months of daily practice, I was excited to finally partake on my first 30-day yoga experience. But... I've been having some hip issues recently and consequently spent the last 24 hours reading about yoga injuries and hip safety. I learned a lot, though a lot of it is still all tangled up in my head :D. To be honest, I was nervous to practice today, in the fear of further damaging my body. So I approached this practice with the maximum mindfulness, truly trying to recognise my limits, find stability and apply the things I had learned. In my case that meant staying active in my body (a little micro movement going on all the time), not overdoing the movements even in the slightest & letting my shoulders rose naturally and steering away from that hip opener (I let my knees fall in instead).  I hope in time I can make these things normal for me that I can again concentrate more on what Adriene's saying haha.

I started this very quiet, very foggy morning here in the south of Germany with a green tea and ""Recognize"".
