297.0,"Hi Adriene, I want you to know how much you've done for me (and it is clear you've done so much for so many people!). Your videos helped me get out of a pretty prolonged funk a few years ago. I had never done yoga before, and tried it just because some one else mentioned that they do YouTube yoga videos. Doing yoga regularly has really changed the chemistry of my brain, and helps me feel really good. I live in NYC and have been house-bound for almost two weeks now because of the virus. I continue to practice with you and it is helping me get through this uncertain time. I'm sure you are well aware of the difference you make in people's lives, but I wanted to share my thoughts with you to say thank you. <3 Elizabeth",Ugw7MBzdsQK0IGYkv1R4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2020-03-29T20:29:09Z,0.9995133876800537

509.0,"Hello friends! I am here with you on the journey of self-improvement. As the days go by and I slowly change my decisions and patterns into ones that better serve me, there are days like today where things come up. Usually, a day will go by where one or two thoughts will occur and I can let it easily flow, but it's another thing when everything happens all at the same time. Maybe that's life's way of testing us, to see if we've truly changed our ways. It's so easy to drift back into the comfortable familiar. Definitely needed to uplift myself today and restore my energy, because even though I was able to save some of it by saying no to things that I would usually say yes to (which is, in retrospect a big win), I've definitely spent time being overwhelmed and dwelling on things that, ultimately don't really matter.

I also really appreciated my feet! They have been working very hard for me lately, I am doing a lot of work in the gym to improve my balance as part of injury rehab and prevention and this practise is really supporting me! Thinking about pressing down with all four corners of the sole of my foot, and imagining energy flowing up the front body and down the back body works so well for balance!

On another note, I’m a teacher and I’d love to get my students to make more professional videos and podcast recordings. Do you mind sharing the recording equipment you use? Part of what I love so much about your videos is the sound quality of your voice!

Thanks again.",UgzQVOqFcmy0QCKpIyl4AaABAg,1.0,8.0,2020-01-25T06:13:43Z,0.9994356036186218

820.0,"On the mat and ready to rock and roll on this rainy Saturday morning. I don't know how to put it but it feels like I now know how to sense what type of energy is around me using my breath with my eyes closed. It really feels amazing every time I do it to the point where I incorporated it into my night routine about a week ago now. It has helped me sleep better. That's even more proof to believe in the saying "" Breathe to heal."" Thank you, Adriene for the uplifting practice and for showing me how powerful mindful breathing can be. Let's spread the positive energy everyone. Namaste.",UgxT_HbgS-NkFq1Lx7x4AaABAg,3.0,133.0,2020-01-25T06:09:19Z,0.9996826648712158

I posted this yesterday, but I need answers and haven't gotten any that's why I'm posting again. Thanks 


Hello Adriene, 
I've been practicing yoga for about 3years now and I find it very hard to use my left hand/wrist to lift my body,  they are very weak and I can't do any pose without support with my right hand. Any advice/exercise  I could do to strengthen it?. 
Thank for this platform
Peace y'all ✌❤",Ugw3bCpdrzlDx4Rf4C14AaABAg,6.0,21.0,2020-01-25T08:30:12Z,-0.8566063642501831
