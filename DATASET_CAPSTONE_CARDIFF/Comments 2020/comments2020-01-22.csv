13.0,"Hi Adrienne, I am not sure if you still pay attention to this thread but I need some insight into my body. I know that you do no have all the answers. I am 2 years into my yoga practice albeit off and on. When I am not practicing I am either weight training, running or both. Although I did not expect Home to be a piece of cake but drawing from my first year of practice I should be a bit more flexible however I find it in the reverse. Where my hips were so open last year and my movements were so fluid now I struggle to stay in a downward dog, my hamstrings protest my heels coming to the ground and I found that doing the one leg pigeon was not easy. I love your practice and I constantly remind myself to be kind to my body but I find myself super frustrated with this. 
Have you ever found your body not able to do poses that were super easy for you in the past? I am open to anyone lending some knowledge as well.",UgwJm9-WNJRxeaqtyz14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-11-08T13:24:59Z,-0.981504499912262

16.0,"It happens very rarely to me but today I was not in the mood for practice. I postponed till the late evening, then found out it was 30 min long and felt even less doing it. I still stepped on the mat. It was tough, I didn't find that usual connection with my body and my inner world which usually yoga gives me but I definitely feel a little bit better than before. One day in the future when I ever repeat the Home journey, I'm sure this practice will bring me totally different sensations.

129.0,"A couple of months ago I ‘did my back in’. Luckily no disc or sciatic problem, just an incredible tightness of the muscles in the lower back that developed over the course of a day so that every bodily movement was scary for the pain. It eased over the next few days with rest, a hot water bottle and hard drugs but it was a wake up call for me as your back is the centre of your body of course, and I have never before felt so debilitated. 
My main exercise is running and I haven’t been able to get back to that yet but I do feel stronger by trying to do some yoga every day. I’ve just finished day 22 in a month and half so, err, nearly every day. I’d like to thank you for putting up these structured practices for us to use for free. Especially in the time of Covid.

221.0,"Have been doing the Home 30 Days of Yoga up untill now. I love it and would like to go on. However, since a couple of days I am finding it more and more difficult to perform some of the new positions. Especially those that involve flexibility in the hips or in the ankles. I always try to alter the positions to match my current capabilities when I don't manage to pull them off like they are 'supposed to'. However for some positions I struggle to find an alternative, like Pigeon Pose. I am not able to rest my upper right leg on the yoga mat because I miss the flexibility and my right ankle hurts a lot, eventually closing off my bloodstream making my leg fall asleep. It is even worse when I switch sides. Any tips on what best to do in those situations. Or am I better off by first developing some more flexibility an then coming back to complete the series? Like I said, I love the series. It is the perfect way to start my day and it has convinced me yoga is the way to maybe even eliminate some of the problems I have run in to during my life, time and time again (like lower back pain and pain in my ankles). Anyway, thanks a lot for the videos. I will be coming back!",UgznW3dPWlJzLLDaPBV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-05-31T13:25:30Z,-0.9912391304969788

236.0,"Dear Adriene,
I wanted to reach out and share the story of a group of people who have been inspired by your classes. On May 1, 2020 I formed a private FaceBook Group and invited friends to join me on your 30 Day Yoga Journey to help us keep active (and grounded) during the pandemic. Each day after members complete your yoga class (or other physical activity), they post a message in our group indicating  ""Done, Day (1), etc along with a comment about your class or how they felt that day. This process of checking in keeps us accountable while we support each other. The majority of members didn't know about you, kind-hearted Adriene, when we started the challenge, but we've all fallen in love with your personality, Benji and your yoga practice. Here are some of our member's comments:

*""You'll love the butt slap in day 3 of Adriene's home yoga video LOL"" (CB)
*""Love it. So not flexible LOL, so definitely going to be good for me. (MK)
*""Just started Day 1 of yoga...hooray! Feeling good."" (JRM)
*""Day 5 done. Back to Adriene, grateful the intention today is to soften, noticed I'm working harder than I need to be."" (SSR)
*Day 7 done. Thank you for the great stretch, Adriene. I needed that (CB)
*""Day 8. So nice to wrap ourselves in love. I love Adriene."" (CA)
*I did Fresh Morning Yoga with Adriene at 5pm to see what will happen...I'm feeling a lot more awake!"" (DG)
*""I'm noticing how the theme of each challenge has been matching what I need, Day 8 done, with much healing (SSR)
*""Day 11: Crow pose. Sort of...ummm NOT."" (CB)
*""Those ab, boaty things are hard, Day 13 and 4k walk done (CA)
*""Day 19 done: I can't believe I haven't given up. (CA)

Adriene, we're now at Day 22! I've found that it's often during the last week of a ""challenge"" is when people need extra words of encouragement to keep going. I'm wondering if you can please ""STIR IT UP"" and send a message to our group to inspire them to continue. You can do this here publicly, PM me on FaceBook (Mary Chang, Story Writer) or contact me through my ""About the Writer"" page at: www.marychangstorywriter.com  Love, yoga, namaste.

I use the blanket that was wrapped around my sweet Mother when she passed for my yoga and when I went to put it up I started sobbing it has been 7 years since she passed and of course I think of her daily but man for some reason it just really hit me after this practice.

357.0,"Ciao! 3 quick things: 
1 What kind of yoga is this? 

I am 60 and fit, have always done physical activity... gymnastics, ballet, contemporary dance, jazz dance, spinning and yet I find some of the poses challenging, I feel STIFF (especially knees and hips) and some of the poses hurt. Is this normal, does it take practice, is the stiffness age-related (?)- although, as I said, I am fit, thin and the gym's doctor told me I have the biological age of a 35-year-old (...this sounds like I'm showing off lol ;) 
2 My question is: can anybody, at any age- with practice- become supple, pain-free and look as ""flawless"" as yoga teachers do? 

3 Is there any international certificate you would recommend to become a yoga teacher?

Thank you.   .......With an almost 2 month-lockdown in beautiful Italy your course is a peaceful challenge I (almost;) daily look froward to.",UgwMuFmxVukcM1kVuGp4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-04-17T12:52:18Z,-0.9268960952758789

Firstly, thanks so much for the videos! I hope you're staying safe and well.


Okay, I have a question, when we do ""forward fold"" it is not my back or my thighs which really prevent me from going all the way down but rather my calves. They feel very tight and interfere the most. This also happens when I try to extend one leg at a time when we're doing Happy Baby or similar poses.

I'm tall and awkward with hips off kilter, not enough strength in my center quite yet. I have more weight than i'd like to carry, but finding my center has helped me in more ways than just being in balance on the mat. I feel like the 30 day practice is always restorative. And no matter how far I drift, the restorative practice always brings me back. 

Adrienne has such a way of projecting restoration. Exactly what this practice intended for me. A return to the practice of yoga and oneself. A return home.",UgwrkUvdzWCU7IIRmG54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-25T09:13:22Z,0.989655613899231

802.0,"Good Afternoon! I felt so awesome today when I learned that my hips are in dire need of attention! I was not able to go all the way down when doing pigeon. The forearms are what I made it too but the point is atleast I did give myself the courage to try to go all the way down but couldnt hold it that long due to really  tight hips. I love that your not only teaching us from your point of view but you remind us to be mindful of all the inbetweens and variations for different body types. I find that I am flexible and I move fast but in certain areas I use the arms for safety and as a clutch. I wish to get deeper. This reminds me of a yin class I once tried to take. Everytime I go deeper stretching the feet start to tingle. Is this normal and/ or does this signify anything important my body is trying to tell me?

And today, I got much closer to a real pigeon than I ever have. And I actually got my knee over in cow pose (sitting on a pillow). I never ever thought this would be in my vocabulary!

Thank you beautiful Adrienne, and thanks to ALL your followers...and yogi out there, your teachings are part of my family, my dear daughter and husband practice Yoga with you, and I am sure they are going to teach yoga to their new son, one day!  I introduced you to them. So thank you for helping me spreading health and awareness of our beautiful amazing bodies. Life is a gift, so like you say, we don't have to do anything but be aware of who we are and accept and love ourselves with gratitude!  One suggestion if you accept it, please make yoga practice routine for AM hrs and PM before bedtime. The morning practice, I like it to be energizing, (no jumping though) so to your opinion which asana routine is most energizing?  Which routing is most relaxing and conducive of deep sleep? I live in the NY area so I can't always go for a walk in the morning before I start my day.

851.0,"In pigeon when you said 'if you're feeling a little tenderness, I've got you' I realized that I was feeling very tender and I could feel it start to bring up tears, but I breathed through it and allowed myself to just feel it, which stopped the crying. When I got to the same spot on the other side in pigeon, I felt that tenderness even more and I opened myself up to it to see what I was feeling. I realized I was feeling like a lost child, scared and alone. I realized that in that moment I really wanted a place to lay my head. And I cried for the rest of the pose. And I drew strength from the fact that my yoga mat has my back, Adriene, you have my back, I have my back by tending to myself and showing up every day. God has my back by loving me and bringing me back to him.
