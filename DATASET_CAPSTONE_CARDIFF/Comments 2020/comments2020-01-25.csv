9.0,"Love note to Adriene:

I hold so much gratitude for this practice, and for you for putting HOME together. It's my first of your 30 day yoga journeys and it's the first time yoga has felt good for me. As a beginner, this has been the perfect pace and intensity to remain accessible for the duration of the journey. I start every day with HOME and look forward to getting out of bed to show up... a lifetime first for me! Today's practice was so nourishing and needed, I'll tell you that five minutes after it ended I burst into tears and had a great emotional release. Thank you for bringing your light and flair to YouTube. Your sense of humor, gentle manner, and goofiness are refreshing. I think I'm hooked, and can already tell this alone has changed my life for the better. 

<3

24.0,"Adriene, I have been severely disabled for more than seven years, to the point where I could not exercise at all. In the last several months, when I began to recover my health and look around for movement to strengthen my body, I found your channel and started trying shorter practices. My fianc√©e and I did the BREATH journey earlier this year, and we are now this far into HOME. I wanted to share how amazed I am to find that I can do this; I can practise and grow stronger and more centred. It is profoundly empowering and deeply meaningful. 

The first time I ever heard you say 'put one hand on your belly and one hand on your sweet heart,' I reached over without thinking and put my hand on my partner's heart. Tonight as we laid on our mats we held hands and softened together in gratitude. This really does feel like coming home to myself. So for all your work, I sincerely thank you.

I did everything i can to bring him back but all was in vain, I wanted him back so badly because of the love I had for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to friend and she suggested that I should Rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back , I had no choice thank to try it. I messaged the spell caster, and he assured me there was no problem and that everything will be okay before three days. He cast the spell and surprisingly on The second day, my husband called me. I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that had happened He wanted me to return to him. He also said he loved me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again.You can contact him if you need his assistance in your relationship or any other Case.

As far as the psychological benefits go, Yoga has helped with my anxiety, and the fact that I'm seeing the 30 days through is doing wonders for my self-confidence. Due to mental health issues, I've had a hard time finishing what I start (I'm bipolar), but it's been a lot easier to maintain a routine now that I finally found meds that work and I like what I'm doing.

This session confirmed that recognizing our true needs is crucial. Through this 30 days journey, I had a strong connection between what is happening during the day and on a yoga mat. Today was even more special - I was so tired and the first time since I have started this challenge I left the session for the late evening. Now, after I did it, I am so thankful that I followed my intuition. Perfect timing of each session.

I work in imports, freight forwarding for the last 13 years and worked for the same company in 1998-2002 when I had left due to moving far away. My Employer has been good to me but when they speak to you in front of your co workers disrespectfully and they don‚Äôt realize this you are uncomfortable and realize that the yoyoing has been enough. At my age and at this stage of my life I want to work the best I can and not be stressed. I thank You for listening. I live in Rockland, Ma and have been looking for another job but it is not easy.

By the time we realized it we'd had a party of more than 20 guests who all but 6 or 7 became ill in varying degrees. My husband and 2 of my adult children violently. Boooo! So, coming back to Unwind today was perfect. The invite to hear and recognize our thoughts then let them go. I am so human and was actually harboring bad thoughts bordering on anger from the visit. Even though I knew it was not their fault. Unwind. The breathing. The relaxation allowed me to move beyond. At least being end of semester I had no school yesterday and could take the day to rest.

I woke up in the middle of the night and wrote it all out, went back and read it today and I feel like the self doubting habit I've carried for so long died with that experience. I feel more sure of myself and my abilities. I feel I have unlocked some new potential within me, new strength I didnt know I had. It's hard to explain really but I just feel so good in my body but also like ik starting to understand what it all means. I was fully in the place of the witness for the first time and for an extended period. It felt as if I unlocked a new view of my own reality.

Every time I've stepped foot on the mat, with your guidance, I've felt the strength of my body, the resilience of my mind, and the balance and cohesion between the two. I can't express how much this has served me. For the first time in a very long time I actually feel like I have solid ground beneath me, and I'm grateful that the mat also has my back.

I found that arm twist swing in 24 really interesting. I closed my eyes and felt as if my tummy was being ringed out. Then in chavasina just now the more I went inwards the more my light spread through and did a inner body check. Also I felt really peaceful. I like that pose as it helps me to really check inwards.

So I wasn't able to do yesterdays session and thought about doing it now that it's sunday evening and I'm finally home again. But at first I was like okay I'm just gonna do yesterdays session and just be one day ""behind"" and that's okay. But as I saw todays theme it was clear that I would just do both even tough I just wanted to go to bed so badly. After these two very full days I literally felt the whole stress clinging to my body. So I just did as if yesterdays and todays videos were one session. And it was the best I could have done. Yesterday's gave me a bit of energy back and today's was just perfect for how I felt. Throughout the whole session I felt the stress falling of my body. It was so amazing. 

Adriene, I am SO thankful for you. These Yoga-Sessions are my highlight of the day. You motivate me to look after me, listen to myself and my body and to take care. So I did today. I'm so thankful that I'm even writing this comment even if I'm not an comment-person at all and even tough before these practices I just wanted to go to bed. Thank you, Adriene. For everything.

541.0,"Really felt the need to unwind today,I can't believe that I actually have tears in my eyes, I haven't cried since the very last time I had a very heated argument with my mother.... But, I really was piling up the stress throughout tbese last few months,and I hadn't noticed any of it up till now.

 I am so tired, stressed, and I feel like I am not fully committed to my studies as I should be, but I am rather taking more care of myself and my physical body, so I have started Keto and I am daily doing yoga, while I don't guilt myself for that..... I don't even know what I am guilting myself for. But I am just so distracted, and I feel like I am working in all directions and aspects of life, and I am not really going nowhere.

 Although in the last week and 2 days I have lost 3 kilos by doing Yoga and Keto, I should feel accomplished, I should feel happy.... But instead, I am so scared? I am so scared of all the what ifs. And the fact that no one is helping me and I am always busy, just leaves me 3/4th of the time starving myself, because I don't have time to do something healthy for myself to eat. It's wrong, I admit. But, again I don't have time, and it kind of stresses me out, because this isn't how I wanted my experience to be.

And then there's school and all the courses that I am doing, 2 courses and 7 subjects at school, and I feel like I am just not the same me, the same nerdy, hard-working, curious, good old me...instead it's like I am shell of my old self and boy do I feel so bad. It's because there's just so much of everything, that I actually can't catch up on everything, that I can't excelle in all 9 topics and it's so unnerving because they're all so important, and again I don't have much time for myself anymore to read, to draw, to write.... To put it simply. I don't have time to live.

I have reached a point in which, I don't talk about anything except school and everytime I open my mouth I just start vomiting a load of information, I have forgotten what it means like to have fun, and I just want to cry, because this is so much.

 Then there's the fact that my phone doesn't open anymore, like it just went ' sorry baby, can' t take your life anymore, do it by yourself '. And my father isn't planning to buy me a new one, and I used to heavily count on my phone, on doing yoga, searching for my research topics, doing my projects, taking some extra programming courses, because the curriculum isn't enough.... And actually having a breathe every now and then but now that it's gone too. I don't know how to feel.

So this routine, was absolutely needed, I would have cried if my siblings weren't everywhere around me making noise, and I had every 2 seconds to shout at them to shut up, yet it still did its magic and I am already feeling so much better.

631.0,"Today, I looked back and saw that on day 1, over one million people watched the very first video of home.  Today, on day 25, just over 16,000 people are still here.  If you are one of them, I have enjoyed every time Adriene has said, ""Think of all the people practicing with us all over the world.""  I don't say this because I feel ""better"" than anyone else.  After all, I have joined the January practice for the last three years, and this is the very first time I have been able to stay with the calendar.  
What I am trying to say...except I seem to be having some trouble spitting it out already...is that we each really do need to ""find what feels good"".  I think comparing yourself to anyone in this journey can knock you off track more than any other thing.  Missing one day can shake confidence.  Our own minds can be our worst enemies, and we often cannot turn of that negative voice.
Anyway, I appreciate you and am sending well wishes to everyone who is still on track and to those who may have another journey that is more important right now.",UgzLXCoZuvo20aA1-6Z4AaABAg,0.0,25.0,2020-01-26T14:00:53Z,0.9938509464263916
