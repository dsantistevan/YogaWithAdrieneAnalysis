10.0,"So far, for me, day 17 was the most challenging of this journey. All together but especially the part with arms behind our backs and with the transition to the Warrior One. 
I still took from this practice what I could, I definitely learned something in the last 7 months of doing yoga with Adriene. For example, I understood that my frustration was coming from the fact I was doing something wrong because I know that usually if I'm doing yoga with the right approach, the same movement feels different. And when I understood it, I understood I was not putting power in my feet and when I did it, the boring movement stopped being boring =) 

And an interesting thing happened today, the weird side when we interlace fingertips didn't feel weird at all! I even had to redo it back to normal one to understand if the side was the weird side! XDDD",Ugy9p9rOJvRTohBy0Vl4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-09-13T18:53:46Z,-0.9922845363616943

My chest was so tight, and I felt nauseous and so angry with myself for missing my appointment. But instead of going on my phone or turning on the TV, I ran to the kitchen to make tea, and said to my mom "" I gotta go do yoga to work through this mood!"" I ran upstairs and committed to my practice. I still feel disappointed in myself, but I am so proud that I made the decision to turn to yoga for healing, and not my phone or Netflix! Something is changing inside me, and I can see it in those moments of distress. So I am grateful for that!",UgyQwMWfqZc2vrPrQFp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-06-12T16:37:07Z,0.9863126873970032

I'm now a month post-corona virus- recovery and one of the residual symptoms for me has been decreased lung capacity.

I decided to listen to my body, to thank it for healing me and getting me through other chronic illnesses, I decided to seek forgiveness for being so hard on it on a daily basis. I simply learnt the sequences and did them to my full capacity; taking all the time my body and lungs needed. 

This daily practise has been one of the most healing things for me throughout quarantine; everyday I wake up excited to hit the mat and feel energised and thankful after every session.

192.0,"Hi! I adore practicing yoga with you through your amazing videos. I have a constructive criticism to make, though, and I hope this gets read. The ending music is totally off. It works great for the intro, but keep in mind that the person might still be on the floor, relaxing, listening to their body. At the end of a practice, it feels disruptive. I work with music selection and editing (irrelevant, but I have the vocabulary to pinpoint why it feels so and what could feel better), and I think something more subtle and less high pitched could be better to ease us out of the practice. Maybe something less ""corporate motivational"" and more minimalistic, loopish, fewer elements, to get the driving force for ""regular life"" started again. Terry Riley, Philip Glass sort of music? Or many other kinds, just something less.... loud. More appropriate for someone who is at home still in touch with their body. Who knows, they might even feel like doing another one.

296.0,"I have to say, Day 16 and today have been disappointments for me. I guess when starting this journey I expected the intensity to ramp up. These days have been just slow and boring. Today felt like 20 minutes of doing the same exercise with no real idea why. I get that it's mindfulness, I guess, but repeating the same exercise so much just begins to feel rote. I actually skipped forward a couple minutes earlier (a first) and paused the video around 22:00 to write this comment. I don't like feeling like this because I was really enjoying the series up until around this point. I'm guessing the series' objective here just isn't aligning with my own goals? I will stick with the series at least another few days and hope it speeds up. I do love your attitude Adriene, so I hope I'll find something else from you that resonates more.

6:15 / 7:15 / 20:22- first & second outstretch while sitting and first outreach while standing. Initial movements had extra inhale while arms extended, without a cue to exhale first. Later it changes to inhale extend and exhale arms in. 

6:40 - first hands behind neck. No cue to hold the breath

17:40 / 18:20 - instructions much longer than an exhale. Found myself holding my breath waiting for the next cue. Difficult to do while in chair pose.

When you said “bow your mind intelligence to your body intelligence,” Adriene, i really thought about how the mind is actually dependent on the body just as much as the body is dependent on the mind. We can’t think or function well enough unless our bodies and their energies are tended to and neither can we function well unless our bodies tend to our minds ! Being still and just thinking, listening to our minds is how we heed to our minds and moving and shifting our bodies’ energy is how we tap into what feels good.

I felt irritated by the synchronicity and the repetitiveness of the seated posture. My mind wandered to anywhere but 'here' because I didn't want to do this. I made it through to the end, I kept recalling myself back but I wanted to quit, to cry so I appreciate this practice because the harder ones help me to reset and to focus. It's easy to go through the motions and it feel capable and easy, but that's not life so this practice was a recall to life lessons.

It's a moment of BEING HERE NOW to honor the spirit of Ram Dass and ourselves and each other!
I'll be there and I betcha Adriene will be too!  
Not to be annoying, but I'll post the same thing on more of the recent Home videos, as I'm sure many people who love Adriene would also love to be a part of this, and some people are still catching up.
Since this is the first, and probably last time, I'll ever feel moved to share something like this, I just have to say, as so many others have, how miraculous Adriene's influence has been me. Practicing asana with her has truly changed my life. It has led me into a meditation practice and honestly, a complete transformation of both my inner and outer worlds.
Adriene is truly a guiding beacon of light, and I thank her profoundly in my heart at least once during every practice for being who she is and doing what she does.

Not only am I seeing awesome changes in my physicality but I stop often to take deep fulfilling breaths. I stop often when I notice tension in my body, breath in, tense up harder then breath out and let it all go. Also, my posture, I had not realized how bad my posture has been all my life (horrid, I now see!) but I find that I am now correcting the bad ways I nestle into sitting and standing. No wonder I have been in so much pain for so many years! I am grateful for this practice.

776.0,I’ve notice that really slow flow yoga like this with repetitive movements really makes it hard to train the monkey mind for some reason. I definitely have a harder time with it than more of the faster pace stuff. It’s harder for me to not over think and I get frustrated/ bored. I’m not sure what that says about me.

778.0,"A few days ago I had a moment during one of Adriene’s videos where in savasana I went into a blissful trance, I couldn’t even pause the video to have that moment quietly, my body was just guiding me through a dreamy happy blissful trance, and it was very special. Today, at the end of this video when we brought our palms together to put our thumbs in our third eye, I just...I don’t know how to explain it without it sounding weird our obvious haha but the thing is like, I felt, but REALLY felt my palms (?) when they touched the first thought that came to my mind was ""wow, these are my palms!""

The harmony between my breath and the flow of my thoughts during these kinds of practices never ceases to amaze me. It sometimes even makes me fall back asleep for a few minutes as I often do my practice early in the morning. Thanks, Adriene for yet another magical practice. Let's make the most out of this time together everyone. You're all awesome. Namaste.",UgySGwIA3kI1GbXr4-94AaABAg,1.0,3.0,2020-01-18T06:20:50Z,0.9998533725738525
