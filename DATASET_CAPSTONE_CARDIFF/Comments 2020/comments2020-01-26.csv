2.0,"I've done maybe four of these 30 days in the last couple of years. I feel that they are good indicators for my depression. I do go through the 30 days, but there is always a point in the month and point in individual films where I just don't feel it anymore. Now it was day 20. I've made it to this day (and I will make it to the end before Christmas), but I've stopped the last 6 videos after 10-15 minutes. Nope, not motivational, but the other bodily exercises motivate me even less and I suppose I should be doing something.",UgwGLbSqLsT4ryKc3BJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-12-19T07:40:57Z,-0.9900922179222107

34.0,"Today was extraordinary. I had a really tough time and the day before yesterday, I couldn't really get into the practice until it was nearly over. After having slept horribly I had such a hard time getting up and feeling motivated today.

Then I sat down on my mat, started the video and suddenly was full of joy and excited for the practice and smiling like an idiot.

I have never felt so confident, so in line with my body, so enthused like during today's practice. Whenever Adriene said ""You got this"" I heard my self repeating - and believing! - I got this!

It was beautiful. Thank you Adriene.
I also suddenly realized during today's practice, that after 26 days, I can't imagine my life without my daily yoga practice anymore. So grateful I got Breath to look forward to right after this.

Again, thank you, Adriene, for changing my life and taking me along on this beautiful ride. ‚ù§Ô∏è",UgxFk7qQQILh5W8D0Zx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-03-02T12:51:41Z,0.9992788434028625

71.0,"So, I started the Home Journey in January along it came out and although not daily, kept doing it whenever I could. Then I fell off and stopped doing yoga for about 3 - 4 months. Today I was really feeling like I owed myself to take care of me, and so I did this practice. And I couldn't be happier nor it couldn't have been a more appropriate one. Reminding myself to keep the good things (like yoga practice) and let go of those that are not. Also, at the end, Adriene kept repeating that this was a DAILY practice, and we should be proud to be doing it daily, I honestly laughed at it being an ironic joke. And that's okay.

Therefore, when you move your left leg or arm, you should say ¬´right¬ª so your students won‚Äôt be confused. And when you move the right side, you say  ¬´left¬ª. Hope you like this tip.

146.0,"Hi Adriene!  First, thank you so much for your wonderful mission of bringing yoga into the homes.  Yoga is something that has been important to me for a long time now and as a mother and teacher, it's not realistic for me to have a membership to a studio (although I do miss in person classes).  You are such a great teacher and for the first time in all my years of practice, I truly feel like I'm just now scratching the surface of what a yoga practice means.  Thank you.  I'm nearing the end of my 30 day Home journey with you and I don't want to lose my momentum.  Perhaps you discuss this in your later videos, but I was wondering where you would suggest going from here?  I don't want to jump into another 30 day journey just yet, however, I'd love to do another series with you.  Which would be best to build on what we learned in Home?

The real reason I wanted to comment though was because today, with this video, I had a breakthrough. I was born with missing a toe on my right foot. One in a hundred thousand kids are born missing a toe, and typically along with that they are usually missing their tibula or the fibula meaning that they can`t walk. I was a lucky kid (one in a million statistically) that i had both of those bones, but instead of having a ball and socket ankle joint my ankle is fused and I`m missing a ray of bones in my right foot. my  foot is a full shoe size smaller than my left, and my right leg is about an inch shorter than my left. when i was young i had a surgery to take out the growth plate on my left leg so my right could grow and catch up. whenever you say to center on all four corners of your feet i can`t on my right foot. it feels like i have two and a half corners to balance on. today when we were balancing on our right leg and lifting our left I did it! while i was doing it i thought ""Man, this feels good, but it`s gonna SUCK on my right leg!"" and then i realized i was balancing ON my right leg! I damn near started crying i was so proud of myself.
Thank you so much for your positive energy in your videos!  yoga is my favorite part of my day now

I think anything we try to hold on to comes from a place of unknowing ourselves; that we have that thing but we've been convinced that it is outside of us. Alan Watts once observed that the objects of our possession become the source of our evil; be it money, love or anything. Because sometimes we will do things against our own nature to keep them. But to let it be lets it flourish and circulate throughout the universe. That which comes to us will leave, and so I have everything when I keep nothing.

I tried to keep grounded as best as I could, especially since the practice was a bit too fast for me. It's crazy how some notions or vocabulary if you like can get lost during your practice. I noticed that it tended to happen quite a lot with me. I also tend to do and/or remain in a pose in a certain way although it's not working for me despite all my efforts. I will stop at times but I need to remind myself that it's okay to make it different if it works for *m*e instead of pushing some strength and being stubborn.

The first time my back gave out I was around 10 and it came back once I got older. In August I spent 3 weeks sleeping on the floor, as I couldn't stand the bed. In the first week, it took me 30minutes of stretches to be able to stand. And then... That even didn't help. It took a professional  5 hours! Just to get me on my feet. Since then, I dabbled here and there in some yin yoga, but never really committed and have had a permanent back ache. These last weeks have been an improvement. My back is still sore, but now the majority of the time, the pain is gone.
Thank you!
