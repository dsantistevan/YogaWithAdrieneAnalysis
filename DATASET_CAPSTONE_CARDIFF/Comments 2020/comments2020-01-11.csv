82.0,"Digging 
BY SEAMUS HEANEY
Between my finger and my thumb   
The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.

Under my window, a clean rasping sound   
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:   
My father, digging. I look down

Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds   
Bends low, comes up twenty years away   
Stooping in rhythm through potato drills   
Where he was digging.

The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft   
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked,
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.

By God, the old man could handle a spade.   
Just like his old man.

My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner’s bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods
Over his shoulder, going down and down
For the good turf. Digging.

The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I’ve no spade to follow men like them.

Between my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests.
I’ll dig with it.",Ugxkqni1vhLADgT2FuZ4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-02-09T17:54:06Z,-0.9861154556274414

I've always had a lot of guilt and conversations/memories from school building up inside of me but the past two days they really overflowed. I know I have this power and strength inside me that I've never allowed myself to use but I still cant help but sit here and wish I was different or that I could start over again. Sometimes I think that even if I got to start from the beginning again it would go the same way, like I've gotten too far now and it'd just be easier to erase myself entirely than waste more time. does that make sense?",Ugw6oixWUjvBimFi3jR4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-09-16T13:59:32Z,-0.8929781317710876

I even have done Pilates for a year and a half (very regularly) but no matter the muscle tone I build in my arms, legs, and core- crow pose just always seems unattainable to me.

I always feel good after yoga but after this one I felt even better then usual and am left spiritually more... well I don't know what word exactly but I guess the closest I could get to describing it is closed and centered (in a wonderful way) I feel like tonight I made grounding... maybe it was the rubbing of the third eye or maybe it was the body movements.

508.0,"Stuck in self isolation and today I feel very vulnerable and sad moreso than I have thus far. Came to do today's class thinking NAAAA I don't wanna dig, saw the video title and immediately thought it was gonna be a hard physical workout. I wanted to do tomorrow's nurture class instead as that's what I 'needed' but I said to myself no Beccie, this is the class order to do it in. See what happens and allow this class to aid you. 
At first I was struggling to keep my balance in basic poses and kept telling myself I wasn't in the right mental state, my body can't do this, my body is rubbish at yoga. 
Then Adriene said 'dig can be whatever that word means to you' and something switched. I decided to dig deep within and accept how I felt and let that breath move me through positions. All of a sudden my balance became better and I felt more grounded. I managed to do humble warrior and lean right into it keeping my base strong. 


I ended the session feeling grateful and happy for my body and connected to that power that is so much bigger than ourselves.

Turns out I had all I needed like you say all the time Adriene and I did dig deep, digging deep was what I needed today.

I'm utterly impressed with myself for embarking on this journey and staying strong up until here.
I started out being able to fold down and reach as far as a little over my knees. Today I'm touching the floor(!). 
Never ever ever have I thought I'd be able to do the crow, and I was afraid of pressing play today knowing what lied ahead of me. What happened? I not just did the crow for a few seconds during the video, but after it I set myself on doing it again and, guess what? Held it for a minute. 
You've worked wonders! Physically and, most importantly, emotionally.  (Adriene, I love you!) 
Thank you so much for guiding me and so many others into self-discovery and being the best version of ourselves.

What a beautiful practice! 
It helped me connect to myself today and strengthen the roots of self trust.
Also I'm chilled now and there's this peace and silence within myself. 
Let's hold onto that and remember those feelings whenever feeling stressed.

Do you guys ever feel agressive for seemingly no reason at all?
There might be small things like the pouring rain that you can't control. 
You find yourself being mad at it anyway because you actually wanted to spend time with friends in the outdoors.
Connecting to yourself and thinking about what the worst that could happen might be, lets you smile to yourself. 
It's just rain.
Your clothes could get soaked and you could get sick but that's nothing you can take care of later, right?
Know that there's still a shining light within yourself that no wind or rain could ever stop from shining. 
The sun's always there too, no matter how bad the weather is. 
So keep this little sunshine and hold onto all the little presents life gives to you everyday, no matter how small.

That's what we've  learned from you, Adriene.
Thank you so much and

964.0,"Thousands of years ago, civilizations would struggle for resources: fresh water being a major one of them. This eventually led to the discovery of the water table: that a layer of fresh water is ever present below the Earth that can be reached from anywhere if you keep digging down long enough. 

Maybe that is a correlation to the infinite energy that is present within us; if we dig deep enough, we can begin to strengthen the connection to ourselves and create a ""well"" from where we can draw energy.

Even then, sometimes I forget, and get distracted chasing the things outside of myself-- which moves me away from the main journey inward. Instead, I keep trying to dig shallow wells here and there, hoping that maybe I'll hit water, but end up wasting so much energy in the process by trying to please others or seek validation; instead of focusing and staying the path.

I hope that the lot of us will always remember that what we need is always there and that we remember always to try digging in first before trying to dig a well elsewhere. Namaste 🙏",UgzUSgiBrHRHkxsvu-N4AaABAg,9.0,98.0,2020-01-13T06:21:13Z,-0.9909607768058777

990.0,"I remember being two or maybe three days in and thinking, ""Hey, once I get to Day 10 I'll be 1/3 of the way through."" But now it's day 11 and I'm digging it (and loving all your puns and jokes and lovely messages and encouragement). You make yoga fun, in a way I never thought it could be. It doesn't have to be all serious but as a way to celebrate what the body can do. I'll say, the breathing and stretching and slowing down is harder for me so I was excited to just jump in and get moving today. And then, with the first crouch my knees were like ""oh God."" And then my heart dropped a bit seeing that crow pose and wanting to be able to do it, and figuring it'll take me like a year to do. But then, I looked up your how-to video and I FREAKING DID IT. Multiple times. Looking back at my videos, I totally need to position my knees more centered on the arms instead of at the sides, so I hope I'm not doing it wrong. But I feel strong and sore and tired and I asked Alexa to play Santana's ""Winning"" and I felt like a freaking rock star. Thank you so much for these videos; I'm so glad I chose to be a part of it. A decade ago was when I was exercising regularly and in the best shape of my life. Due to recurring leg pains brought on by running and even hiking sometimes, plus my own anxiety, I just don't do as much as often. With this practice, I'm celebrating coming to the mat 11 days in a row. I'm letting it be okay not to feel pressure to do everything, and accept that something is enough. I'm turning 30 this year, so never a better time to come home to myself and rememeber that I can be strong and that a body that has rebelled against me can still do some pretty cool things.

I’ve been also going to yoga classes these past few years but I have taken about a six-month break because we moved. Just for the record I’ve had two knee replacements so I’m a bionic woman ha ha. My son is a physical therapist and he’s told me that I’m doing things that you’re not even expected to be able to do with artificial knees. For example “child’s pose” should be difficult with artificial knees but no problem for me. I’m keeping Up daily with the practices and I really really liked this day 11 practice.  Needless to say the only part I did not do was lean on my knees in a full squat. I’m so darn proud of myself! Again I’d really like to hear from others who may be in the same position I am with artificial knees etc.  thank you so very very much Adriene for what you given to all of us!!",UgxBQoG2Mj_9lFU3cNZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-13T02:52:34Z,0.9988831877708435

I also wanted to mention that I struggled getting out of bed today. I’ve been struggling with that since Thursday and it’s Sunday now.

I've come to the realization that as long as I try my best to embody my highest self here and now that everything else will fall into place. This practice put my lessons to the test by helping me to put my money where my mouth is. Through these days of practicing consistently I continue to dig deeper into what my highest self needs and the answer I came back with today is simple: presence and surrender. Through all the frustration, encountering habits I wish to change I ask myself; Why not now? It makes such a difference in my energy. Thank you for encouraging me once again to dive deep.

I have been in a journey to rediscover myself for almost 4 months now, have freed myself from almost 40 extra pounds and am still in this journey to free myself from an extra 40 pounds more.  One thing I’ve come to realize, because deep down I knew it, is that the first step (and I think the most important one) to achieve our goals and make our dreams come true is mindset.  Today, my 7 y/o daughter joined me and we shared this session together. Beautiful! Thank you, Adriene! You’re not just helping me stay focused and centered with this 30-day journey, but helping me connect at a deeper level with my daughter and helping her stay connected to her true self.  This yoga practice has elevated my life so much in such a short time that I am very impressed and I intent to keep practicing and sharing it with my daughter for years to come. Thanks!

1197.0,"Today was so good! I am having so much fun during this journey, even though I am not seeing physical changes, I do know that I am feeling a lot lighter mentally. I am so grateful for this journey, because I am doing something, I am moving my body, I feel better everytime and I never feel the amount of time the has passed.... I never feel like I am looking forward to when this is going to end, and I am so grateful for this. 

Something tho that I really want to get off my chest is, today while doing tge peaceful warrior  I felt my thighs and knees just going ' nope, I am too tight ma'am,  can't take it...straighten me for a few seconds then let's continue ' so I had to take a few breaks and I was so frustrated... Because I don't know if I am even doing it right, but then I thought... That.... I have only been here for a few weeks now, about 3 weeks or something... And I can't expect drastic changes to happen so soon. 

So, I took a breathe pushed my body, when I knew that I could take it, and imma be thankful for it, and sometimes I had to straighten out of the pose then get into it again. 

Anyway today, I've taken a decision to lose some weight, and so I am going to start the Keto diet, and go on with the yoga... In hopes that I won't take any rests anymore, and to actually give my body the chance to focus on trimming and toning instead of trying to digest the incredible amount of carbohydrates that I've thrown at it for the day.",UgzsdCzLyPpgI4QYvId4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-12T18:21:15Z,0.9460621476173401

1282.0,"This flow really inspired me. I think the beauty of being at home to practice is it helped me to break down barriers and be honest with myself, without being judgmental and allow me to be fully vulnerable. It teaches me patience with my own self growth and encourages me to dig in and be true to myself and not be afraid to say to myself what I really want and need. I'm just a happier person when I do Yoga and when I build honest meaningful relationships. Unfortunately It got embedded in my mind as I grew up that being raw, honest and vulnerable meant being weak and taken advantaged of. I kind lost of my intuition and self honesty and put up a front. But now I'm at a stage in my life where I want to make a decision about the person I want to be moving forward and I'm so glad that I have this practice to help me figure things out.

1292.0,"I’ve been doing yoga for close to 7 or 8 years and when I started I approached it with the same intensity as one would a HIT class or a spin class. I’m naturally flexible and once I increased my strength I was able to “crank” my body into all the “perfect” shapes. Two years ago my life got really demanding and my body was struggling with my normal workout regimen. I have had to slow way down, I’ve struggled mentally as I’ve lost muscle tone and strength but when I found Yoga with Adriene I’ve been able to approach fitness with a much healthier attitude. I’ve been healing my mind and my body and it’s felt really good. All of this to say... today I approached crow for the first time in a very long time, it was one of my “normal” moves years ago but I have never felt this grounded, this strong, this connected to my body and that was unbelievable encouraging for me. Thank you Adriene and all of the Yoga with Adriene team, I don’t think I can fully express what you’ve done for me.

1312.0,"I've been struggling a lot both in yoga and in meditation to give my thinking mind a break.  I really value yoga and meditation as a space to just let myself exist as I am in the moment, but for the past few weeks my mind has been so cluttered with thoughts, it has been very difficult. But during this practice I realized that instead of pushing and struggling I have to acknowledge who I am right now and honor myself, my abilities and limitations, my fears and shame and insecurities, my dedication and persistence and gentleness. If I don't accept myself as I am and work with myself as I am, then I'm not going to get anywhere because I'm not working on me, I'm working on an imaginary version of me that doesn't exist. 


I realized this right before doing crow, but also as I was doing crow. I've been doing yoga for a year now and I still can't do crow pose. And often when it comes up I'll try to just jump right into it, but today, I realized that by jumping right into the final version and never accomplishing it, I'm robbing myself of the opportunity to actually develop the skills required to do the pose. So today I just stood in a squat with my knees resting in my arm pits and felt the heat in my arms.",UgykhBjReOnY6pUebd54AaABAg,1.0,9.0,2020-01-12T14:42:31Z,-0.9905753135681152

I have done yoga before using videos at home or going to a class but never did it consecutive days. It is only day 11 and I can feel the difference. I told my chiropractor and osteopath( I go to both!) and they said I really need it given my type A personality and chronic back issues. The physical benefits are quickly apparent to me, the mental ones may take a while as it is hard for me to quiet my mind during the practice especially when my Jack Russell Terriers want to be in the thick of things!  They are not chill like Benji!  I hope to continue something after 30 days, there are alot of video offerings. I feel some of these moves are very advanced and I just flop around the positions I can not get into( like today's hand stand- no way!!). I'm working to make my transitions better for now....

But I just realized that even like this I find my little moments. Sometimes during the day I realize that my posture is much better. 
In addition, I just catch myself every other day sitting up tall, looking out of the window and just breath. It makes me realize that my anxiety issues are big, but I am lucky to be where I am. When I inhale I imagine to inhale the sunshine and happines and exhale the anxiety.
