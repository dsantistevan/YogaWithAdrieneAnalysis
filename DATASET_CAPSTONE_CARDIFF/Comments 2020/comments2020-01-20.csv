I expected to go on a big trip this spring, and to visit friends, but that was cancelled. I certainly didn’t expect the world to be as it is now. I expected it to be a fabulous year. As much as I can try to make the best of things, it still won’t live up to the fabulous expectations I had for it. Expectations hurt when things don’t go as expected. It’s so hard to let go of expectations. This year is certainly making me have to accept things rather than expect things. Until I can reduce how often I expect, I will be disappointed more often.

But I know I need to meet myself where I'm at! I think I need to refocus and remember that the goal of this is not be able to do a certain pose or movement, but to simply experience, breathe, and focus on the here and now.  Going to keep with this journey, and hopefully continue to grow stronger.

I would get up from a dinner table and run away, scream and flail about and freak out in public if they fly near me (yes, I've been told 1000 times to just be still, it doesn't help haha). And yet, when this bee flew in and I saw it land on the curtain, I just acknowledged it, dissolved any tension/stress within my body, and continued with my practice in stillness. I usually would have ran out of the room and locked the door, even if it was nowhere near me! But I shared my space with that lil bee (actually, it's pretty big), and it kindly stayed nice and silent... all the way until the final few moments, with our hands together taking our final few breaths together. My eyes were closed, it started buzzing, I couldn't see where it was going, what it was doing. My body started to tense up, but I relaxed into it, found the stillness, and finished up the practice.

530.0,Also - a general point for the northern hemisphere people - I always keep a light cheap blanket within reach so I can just quickly lay it over my knees when sitting or my middle when lying down. It’s just too cold to sit for very long (even with layers on) so the blanket really helps me to enjoy the reflective moments in comfort. I toss it aside once we’re off & moving because then the heat arrives pretty quickly. It’s taken me 4 years to really sort this but I’ve got it down to a tee now. It’s just a lightweight IKEA cheapo fleecey thing. It works a treat & is as essential as the mat. I’m 2 days behind (not too bad for me) but loving every single day.

Then I asked myself how I can feel that more during the day and the answer was by letting go. Thank you so much for sharing this with us. I'm doing yoga with Adriene for almost a year now and it is now part of my every day routine. I noticed how much it helped not only my body but also mind, soul and my self development.
BTW I noticed that sometimes when you are talking you say: Ok I stop now, shut up Adriene or you apologize. PLEASE DONT. This is what makes you and your chanel so special and friendly and this is why it feels like home. keep talking and sharing your amazing and funny and sometimes crazy thoughs with us. We love that.

554.0,"WELL, f'ck a duck, I came to the mat expecting something easy and definitely had some struggle bus moments...what I noticed in stillness was that I overate at dinner, ha! Also, my feet were stiff as heck! 
Yesterday's balance practice was wonderful, with winter sunlight filtering through the windows. I felt embodied in a specific, transcendent way -- you know, when you hit that flow and it has the quality of poetry about it... 

How fascinating that the different ways we move our bodies can bring out such different things! 

I'm going to try to go back to doing these in the mornings - I draw more out of the experience when I do that instead of sticking to the williest of nilliest commitments... ""well, I know I'm going to do it, so I'll just figure out when later!"" Eek. I'm fairly comfortable being on-the-fly and try not to fight too much against my true nature, but I also know that it hasn't always served me. 

So here's to finding balance within the discipline. To finding stillness within the discipline. The imagine bouncing around in my head is a box and within that box, the ability to play -- like the idea that creativity thriving within boundaries, and as Adriene says, freedom within the form. 

Glimmers of understanding gained each day! And for right now, a mind that's ricocheting around a bit and the brain monkeys shaking their fists, going ""what are you even trying to SAY, woman,"" but gratitude for the space, even if it's just to rambleflect (reflect in a ramble-y sort of way), and namaste to all!",UgzRQ3b5jzSqFIUWO9N4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-23T02:09:32Z,0.9944925308227539

678.0,"Good evening! I enjoyed todays practice because it allowed me to realize that when you said ''stronger,faster'' in the end. Thats definitely where I tend to go straight for when doing my practice. This has become a way of life in terms of showing up everyday and really being present with what you said. I lost my job shortly before I found this yoga journey. I was very exhausted. I had been practicing yoga but always really paid attention to little things like the teachers voice but my dear you have the most soothing voice! I also loved being able to pull the legs up with the arms and hands in the lift up pose you did. I did day 18,19 and 20 today. Its amazing that this has become a part of my day and its amazing to realize thats all it takes is to show up and enjoy something. On the way to developing good habits! This practice has saved my life~

I was tempted to not allow myself the time to practice today - ‘it’s a yin style practice, I won’t be burning calories or toning muscle’ - but I committed and showed up. What I burnt was my anxiety, and what I toned was my selfawareness. Lying in shavasana I felt a wave of guilt and quietly said to myself ‘I’m sorry’; I then replied ‘it’s ok’, and you know what?
