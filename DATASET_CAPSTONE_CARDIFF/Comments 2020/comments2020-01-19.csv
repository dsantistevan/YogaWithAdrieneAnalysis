BUT...I felt super accomplished when I did prayer hands with the squat, even if it was just for a few seconds, even if I'm not at the crow pose stage yet. And I felt amazing at the end, like I earned a bit of rest. That's what it's all about with you, Adriene. You're so encouraging and you tell us we're strong.

I'm learning that my ""home"" isn't broken and I didn't lose the illusion of a support system that my family provided; I have everything I need and my true home is inside me. On bad days where I need extra love; I know my mat and this community have my back. This journey is incredibly powerful and emotional for me.

273.0,"10 years ago, during high school, I stayed in a wheelchair for 3 months after my knee dislocated and a doctor at the hospital made the wrong call and fucked up the muscles in my right leg. Since then I've always tried everything to get my thigh muscle back to its original strength, and I've always failed. At day 19 of this yoga journey, my muscle isn't completely back of course, but I can feel for the first time in forever that it is GROWING. It's getting stronger, I can feel it, and I am forever grateful. My left thigh is much more strong, but, not having to go through physiotherapy it is also much less stretchy compared to my weak but very mobile right leg. I'm fixing both those imbalances thanks to you. I can't think of doing a yoga practice that's not with you, it helps my peace of mind.

620.0,"Thank you Adriene for this and all other videos, I have practiced with you dozens and dozens times and will continue <3 You are amazing, keep on going <3

One tiny constructive feedback I'd like to give, is that I have noticed that many yoga teachers tend to say something like ""take a moment to not think about the stressful things in your life"". I think it works quite the opposite. It's like saying ""don't think about a garlic baguette jogging"" ‚Äì you will think about that. Even though it's good mindfulness and acceptance practice to try to let those thoughts go. So, if possible, it would be great to guide the focus to the breath, the moment, or anything going on right now. I know the purpose is good, but I prefer positive encouragements instead of the ""don'ts"".

Today I was finally able to do a full crow pose and I started screaming and laughing with joy. Adriene, you have no idea how much joy and happiness you brought into this boring day of mine. I didn't even think it was possible for me to achieve that pose, yet I did it and it felt like I was flying. It was freeing, it was beautiful and you just filled me with so much love and lightness. And this journey with you is giving me a little purpose for myself, I'm tryna take care of my body and mind each day and it feels so good.

So yesterday my prompt was ""balance"". When Adriene mentioned that balance isn't something to achieve, but something to return to, I was like whooooooaaa. Totally. It makes balance easier and more compassionate. It makes it easier because it takes the ""do"" or the work out of it because there is nothing to achieve. And it makes it more compassionate because it takes the failure out of it. You can't fail if you're not working towards achievement. Well, maybe you can, idk.

Knocks us off balance. This practice has definitely brought me closer to balanced than I ever remember. I am in my third year of running a department. I have 4 staff members, 7 student TAs, and 4 subs. I feel myself more easily letting go of the days when one performs below, what I know is,  their level best. We all have days when we just aren't our best. I'm good at not attacking them over those days, but now I find myself looking beyond that behavior even in the privacy of my office.

It's a moment of BEING HERE NOW to honor the spirit of Ram Dass and ourselves and each other!
I'll be there and I betcha Adriene will be too!  
Not to be annoying, but I'll post the same thing on more of the recent Home videos, as I'm sure many people who love Adriene would also love to be a part of this, and some people are still catching up.
Since this is the first, and probably last time, I'll ever feel moved to share something like this, I just have to say, as so many others have, how miraculous Adriene's influence has been me. Practicing asana with her has truly changed my life. It has led me into a meditation practice and honestly, a complete transformation of both my inner and outer worlds.
Adriene is truly a guiding beacon of light, and I thank her profoundly in my heart at least once during every practice for being who she is and doing what she does. 
Namaste everyone, from Boston!

I use the word balance in other things though with my body its always a hit or miss. Today was abit of a hit and miss. Crow is always a challenge for me, sometimes I get it other times not. I use blocks to help me stabilize myself, and i got up there for a second, these tree trunks (legs) !!! but I felt good stretching my legs and I'm learning to push my inner thighs closer to my body to keep my balance which is helping. All in all a good play time being that my energy is low today. Oh also those push ups (my fists had to come out to help me up and down as my wrists were being 'fussy') Hope other yogi's flew in crow today and enjoyed the seesaw of balance.
