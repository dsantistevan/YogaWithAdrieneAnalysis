And I always read comments after practicing as I find interesting how other people experience this journey.  One thing I noticed, everyone who writes about the time they do yoga, they mean morning. Am I the only one who does it in the second part of the day? Sometimes almost at night but more often before dinner and before lunch on weekends. Never done it in the morning, I feel just so wobbly and need to drink my coffee and eat something, and after eating can not do yoga!

When Adriene said ""wherever you are today...everything is as it should be"" I felt a huge release and just bawled my eyes out  (and   continued to do so throughout much of the practice...not something that has happened before).

Perfection is not an objective goal. Being here and being absolutely content in your soul is perfection.",UgzDL1VIyOKV9NjIpbl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-19T10:13:30Z,0.9995658993721008

This session was tough and i thought it was becasue i was pushing myself with doing a million other things but I read some comments here and I see that some of us have found it difficult to.

284.0,"Dear Adriene, I‚Äôm so glad I found your channel! I decided to start this journey with the 30 day yoga challenge, and all I can say is thank you! I always wanted to start to try doing yoga, but the fear of not being able to do things right always pushed me backwards. But by following your videos and seeing how you encourage us to embrace the stage we are in and to keep showing up, I understood that it‚Äôs ok if we struggle, and if we continue we eventually start seeing some small changes happening. Thanks to you, I started to really enjoy this practice and realized that by not being so hard on myself I could actually learn new things that seemed scary at first and keep growing.

When it got to warrior 1 and lifting my leg on the left, I just shook and couldn't find balance. Instead of getting upset and angry at myself, I paused the video and just told myself to breathe. Through breath and not allowing myself to fall despite my mind telling me to, I flew. It felt really powerful too. I couldn't have done that a year ago.

I personally haven‚Äôt been flooded but 200 homes lower down have. You might ask why I‚Äôm doing this practice when I could be out checking drains etc. The reason is that through this practice from your videos I‚Äôve learnt that I‚Äôm set up emotionally for the day. I have more resources to draw upon and today, I‚Äôm going to need a lot of inner resources as folk get stressed and upset. Thank you Adriene.

507.0,"I really didn't feel like showing up today... Such a long, torturous day. Kids in the school I subsitute in were exceptionally violent and loud today, been called every foul name in the book and had my shines kicked multiple times by frustrated pupils... It's hard having to force punishments (sitting in a chair in the break time and such, nothing violent or oppressive on our sides) when you haven't given them and technically it's your hour off, but since it was a schoolmeeting in the evening I didn't get to leave to home and I wanted to help instead of going to the grocery store or just outside for an hour. Sometimes I think I'm too good for this world. It was hard keeping my balance, keeping my composure and not going in the argument. I've been holding a pupil back from stabbing another pupil with scissors yesterday and still I felt more balanced doing that than what I did today. What a crazy job I have sometimes.But how they need me to show up everyday, stay grounded, stay calm. Be their center when they can't find their own. So glad I showed up. Because if I can show up for them everyday, I better show up for myself too. Or I'll lose it oneday and they will be the victims. Selfcare to care.

Believe. Boy, did I need this message yesterday. There was this energy on me yesterday, like two hands were around my neck trying to choke my joy, hope, and love. I wasn‚Äôt even planning on doing yoga yesterday, but my inner life-force, plus my Angels, inspired me not to give up. 

So, I squeezed it in after a shower, and an hour before the Y closed. I am so glad I made it! I sensed that my body, and my energetic body are in rhythm now with a flow of ease when I get on the mat...it doesn‚Äôt take long to surrender.  I also felt a nice rinsing away of any heaviness and doubt. Believing the ‚ÄúYes‚Äù that is in my heart even when there is a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù staring back at me.

...which, I think, speaks to the moment in the present and the ""meta-moment"" in time. where we are right then and there, and also, where we are in our lives. I've struggled a lot with this in the past (as I'm sure many of us have) especially in context re: narratives about how successful we ""should"" be - and that fear, that ""not enough""-ness keeps up stagnant. Learning to let go and believe is so key to letting energy moving with freshness, vitality, and faith. 
Parts of today's practice felt very intuitive to me - my body made natural adjustments, without thinking, to make the movement strike the right balance between challenge + listening. I met my appropriate edge and listened to my body at the same time.

I posted on the fwfg community about what happened this morning, I awoke to mom tell me that my 2 lovely bunnies were missing and it turns out early this morning a man that lives in our area stole them for meat and I think I am still in shock and I feel like this world has so much curel people that I can drown in all bad and the entire day I keep hoping that my bunnies are okay and maybe I will get them back but it's so unlikely. I spent so much time taking care of them and loving them I don't know how someone could kill them, I angry and sad and hurt but mostly I feel vialated cause he came into our place and took them and maybe it seems petty but if you love something and spend so much time and effort and money on it and it become family and some just rips it away, trust me you would feel the same.
I was not even able to get a recent picture of them cause I didn't think I would have to let go of them so soon.
 Today getting on the mat was just me going through the motions and I had to anchor myself both mentally and emotional in breathing staying present, I a little less burden but everything is still fresh and I don't think I will be okay for a while  but hopefully I will heal from this in time.
I hope everyone had a better Sunday than I did and if not just breathe you got this and things will get better with time.

It's a moment of BEING HERE NOW to honor the spirit of Ram Dass and ourselves and each other!
I'll be there and I betcha Adriene will be too!  
Not to be annoying, but I'll post the same thing on more of the recent Home videos, as I'm sure many people who love Adriene would also love to be a part of this, and some people are still catching up.
Since this is the first, and probably last time, I'll ever feel moved to share something like this, I just have to say, as so many others have, how miraculous Adriene's influence has been me. Practicing asana with her has truly changed my life. It has led me into a meditation practice and honestly, a complete transformation of both my inner and outer worlds.
Adriene is truly a guiding beacon of light, and I thank her profoundly in my heart at least once during every practice for being who she is and doing what she does. 
Namaste everyone!

The yoga practice today  helped me shift a mindset after a disagreement with partner about dog! I stayed stewing for a short while.  Thankfully, time on my mat this month has served me to find my breath, I was able to recognise the woods around me and soften. I believe in Yoga and this is a special programme of finding inner resources and strengthening them.  All together we are making change that on the collective is powerful. I read that 144k people doing something positive together creates a shift. Thank you and to Adriene for building this movement over the years! Looking forward to Monday knowing if I wake up exhausted then I can lie down on my mat and breathe through 33 mins practice tomorrow! It's good to have that option as it softens the showing up into an invitation. I'm great at falling off after bells and whistles at the beginning so that is something that holds me steady.

ok so todays session I had to modify warrior 1 as my left hip was pinching for some reason (think it might be my bed messing my alignment), and though i retracted it back it twinged abit so i had to do the modified closer to the ground one which actually felt really nice. My shoulders were burning and I had to take the 3 legged dog easy as my energy was up and down and my hip was hurting me. so important to take a childs pose if needed and i lifted my hands up out in front to my finger tips which gave my tummy more space, then i changed to extended as my tree trunks (aka legs) are big so its hard to breathe in the normal childs pose. I really had to push through this one today and listen. I literally have the space of my yoga mat length wise and that's it so have to modify alot of the open arm and leg movements but its ok, work with what you got ey !


 I wanted to do a forearm headstand to relieve pressure off my left ankle as my varicose vains have been hurting my ankle and leg but it didn't happen i wasn't focused enough. Maybe tomorrow.

I decided to start my day with your practice, and you have turned my mood around completely. Thank you for saving this day for me!

949.0,"I have endometriosis, so some days of the month can be a bit of a struggle. Today is one of those days. In the past I've usually just not done yoga on particularly painful and lethargic days, but I decided to try this one out today anyway. I love that Adriene always reminds us to listen to our bodies, and to take 'softer' options if we feel that's what we need. I think I really realised how important and kind that is today (a lot of child's poses for me). It's weird, but despite all the difficult symptoms these times of the month bring, they do actually make me slow down and listen a lot more. It's kind of a gift (though a somewhat barbed one XD). Anyway, much love to everyone! Enjoy today <3",UgzCbdTPA7KeYcubHz14AaABAg,6.0,188.0,2020-01-19T06:57:53Z,0.9986627101898193
