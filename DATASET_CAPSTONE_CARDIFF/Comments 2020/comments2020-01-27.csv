3.0,"I started my Yoga journey on 1st Jan, this year 2021. I needed a focus and something constant. So I started one of Adriennes 30 day Yoga and found myself doing every one of her 30 day sessions with a few of her other sessions in-between when I got a lower back problem and then a bad cold- not Covid.  Adrienne, you are simply amazing. I love your humour and you always seem to hit the right note in the practice. It has simply become something I do for myself.Thank you.",Ugzv_rX-t-wy-sc5XzJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-12-10T18:22:44Z,0.9998350143432617

145.0,"Hello Adriene, 

My words can not describe a gratitude I feel towards you. I started my journey a little less than a year ago. Prior to that I have never(even in the school due to health reasons) did sport or anything even remotely close to a physical activity. As an adult, I did have some attempts to get fit but i could never commit. About a year ago I started your ‚Äú30 days yoga‚Äù. My journey was not perfect. I started from the beginning at least times. I understood that I‚Äôm not going to be able to do it everyday but promised myself that no matter how long it will take - I‚Äôll finish it. It took me 6 months. But eventually I fulfilled my promise. It was a first program that I actually managed to complete in my whole life. Since I started doing this, I also explored other activities like running and dancing. Little by little I actually started loving sport and being active. It‚Äôs now really a routine. I never stopped doing yoga though. Sometimes in class, sometimes with your videos. I‚Äôm writing this because after this practice today I attempted to do a bakasana. And I did it. It was only for a few second but I still did it. I  cried after this. A year ago I could not do a downward facing dog without being out of breath. And now I‚Äôm here. And it‚Äôs all thanks to the feeling that I got after your every video. It took time, but eventually I craved more and more. Thank you so much! You really changed my life.",UgxnbrRyTI3o9rcqjY94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-05-26T19:22:28Z,0.9980741739273071

Then when breathing out there is this upward force while dropping the shoulders. Both making this up down circular circuit. Is that synonymous with the up/down flow of energy coming from the Earth that you mentioned in one of the videos a few days back? Should we think about both at the same time? I'd like to marry both somehow because I like this circular flow of energy concept.

Its been a rough few years and I think its finally narrowing down to a crossroad that will forever change my life. Quite honestly, I've already changed so much, my life has already changed considerably. I love myself now. Not just like me, but LOVE ME. And that is such a beautiful thing, it really is. I hope everyone can get to this point in their lives where they truly love themselves. So maybe this impending crossroad isnt the beginning of my transformation but my finalization. Not that all is over, but either crossroad will be shedding an illusion. That's always a good thing. Whatever happens, it's for my good. My greater good.

I'm new to all this, started about a month ago. I was recommended to start yoga by my Ms nurse. I got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis about 2 years ago with lesions on my brain and spine, I also have a considerable amount of inflammation on my spine, (c2 and c3) spasticity in my legs and arthritis in my ankles . Yep I'm just falling apart lol it's been a tough 12 months. Previous to this I've always been very fit and healthy apart from the issues with my feet. I was wondering if there is any particular yoga sessions that you would recommend to help me build up the strength back into my legs and spine and to help strengthen my ankles as the arthritis is making them very weak.

429.0,"Integration. This was the theme of my entire day. Like a seed that finally springs forth. That‚Äôs how it felt for me today (off the mat).  Something is clicking into place within me. This is so much more than a 30 day yoga journey. Miracles are quietly happening. 

‚ÄúThe struggle is for a reason...Stay connected (integrated).‚Äù  

Roots are strengthening. New neural pathways are being created.

I had a magical moment after practice as I sat cross legged, hands to heart. I came into stillness, and in that instant I felt something that made me laugh...I touched something, and something touched me. 

The Universe is saying, ‚ÄúI got this. You just listen and respond.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou made it. Now, open your wings‚Äù

440.0,"Wow, what a beautiful practice for Day 27! When I first began practicing with you early last year, you were coaching on alignment in downward dog when you said not to worry about the heels dropping down, that one day with regular practice, we‚Äôd feel them touch the mat. You talked about downward dog eventually becoming a resting posture, and I remember laughing out loud, feeling the impossibility of that as I bent my knees and pushed my hips up and tried so hard to keep my back from rounding that I shook in the posture. As punishing as my early days in downward dog felt, I remember the satisfaction of sticking with it, even then. I remember when my heels really did surprise me weeks later, as they grounded suddenly and firmly into the mat below me. In the following months, I remember finding a strength and grace in downward dog that I never thought I would feel. And today, TODAY I USED DOWNWARD DOG AS A RESTING POSE. BY CHOICE.

564.0,"I used to be a ballet dancer, but because of my main career goal, I had to change my focus in life. I am trying to become a dedicated doctor. However, I was unable to manage my time and life in a way that I wanted. I became very distant from the world of ballet and dance for about 6 years, and I didn't really like Yoga despite the fact that my mother always tried to convince me that I needed Yoga. Last year, I unintentionally took a Yoga class at my university, and I realized that how my mind had been very distant from my body in a way that I didn't really take care of my body. I had even gained too much weight, and everyone kept saying, ""Wow!! You have changed so much!"" These words used to bother me a lot, but now through Yoga, I am able to find the balance between my body and my mind. I have even started ballet workouts alongside Yoga. Yoga helps me find balance in life, while Ballet allows me to regain my body form before this transformation. Through Yoga, I have also learned to be aware of my breaths, and this fact really helps me with ballet. This journey has been very beneficial to me, and it really allows me to reach my New Year's resolutions. I am very determined to take care of my body and my mind this time, and I'm very grateful for this journey that has challenged me to believe in myself. Thank you for this channel and this beautiful journey. I hope that you have more challenges for the upcoming months because I really love challenges.
