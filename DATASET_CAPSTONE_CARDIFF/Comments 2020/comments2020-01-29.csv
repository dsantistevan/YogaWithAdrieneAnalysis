Us doing these yoga practices really are acts of self-love. In the past, I would beat myself up during exercise because I wasn't doing as well as others or because I wasn't where I wanted to be, but now I'm learning to instead appreciate the fact that I'm taking this time for myself and that I'm trying my best.

224.0,"I have been loving my every day yoga with Adriene. But I know I'm still really out of shape and I can't move from positions very fast. So this one I felt was very challenging for me. I felt like I was two positions behind the whole way through, and didn't really get to enjoy the movements as much as I wanted to because I felt slightly rushed. For example, I can't step forward from downward facing dog. I have to drop to my knees and then pull one leg forward. By the time I'm getting there, we're already standing and moving onto something else. So there's stuff in between I'm actually missing or skipping entirely. Or when we're in a low lunge and doing warrior one, I can't always stay up like that so I have to drop to my knee and create modifications for certain moves, which takes time. Or something as simple as reaching for my foot or calf and stretching out, I have to use a strap, so I'm having to get that all set up, stretch for maybe a few seconds and we're already moving on already. Again, this is my body and such and I know it's my issue. But I just wanted to make sure I provided some feedback!! I know I need to be patient with myself but I also feel myself getting frustrated with myself also. Does that make sense? Eh. What a day. Thank you, Adriene, for creating a safe place for all of us. <3",UgwhdTqJS74k0ZTktvR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-30T02:52:59Z,-0.9933340549468994

228.0,"What an interesting practice today! I felt so immersed at certain points today, and particularly felt my body working as I attempted half-moon. Cultivated some heat, kept with the breath, felt so GOOD. Then, I attempted boat pose and was like woah! I think I can do it! And I did one, but then pulled something attempting it a second time. It was a bit frustrating, like, ""Really? I put in 100% to try this movement and feel pain?"" But I realize that happens off the mat too! Sometimes we can't control the outcomes, but we can foster our responses to those outcomes. So I just kept breathing, and finished out the practice, and the pain is no longer there. I am so looking forward to tomorrow, and hope to continue to do yoga with you all. <3",UgyPeiam8eaj2Zev_st4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-28T17:01:15Z,-0.664594829082489

At the beginning of this 30 days, I was tight and majorly lacking in strength and I was feeling so doubtful of myself. Yet, I persisted, and today I managed high boat to low boat for the first time ever AND got my first ever full chaturanga. I'm planning on going straight into another 30 day challenge and I could not be more excited. If I could accomplish all that in just a month, imagine what can be done in two.

638.0,"Now, that the 30 days are coming to an end, I would like to ask something that has been on my mind the whole time. Actually, I have 2 questions: 1. Are most of the people on this journey yoga-newbies? 2. Are most of them young, for me that is in their 20s or 30s. I am curious about that because stepping on the mat every day was never an issue for me, but then I have been practicing yoga regularly for about 12 years now and I can really acppreciate the benefits of a daily practice . But it took me time to get there, approx. 2 years. So I have good news for you: stick to a little bit of yoga every day and soon it will be like brushing your teeth. ;-) The second question is because I myself have turned 60 last december and I just would like to know if I am surrounded by young people only here or if there are others that, like me, are older. You can do yoga for a long time but with Adriene's loving guidance you can always learn something new. These last 29 days really were like coming home for me.  With love to you all.",UgzxIbca2vuDfbKTwcF4AaABAg,3.0,0.0,2020-01-30T16:03:31Z,0.996131420135498

When I would try to raise an arm I felt the extended leg lose its momentum of pushing against the wall and a slight  collapsing in the standing leg. ""I"" decided to keep my legs strong and my neck long. I will rewatch the video after work. I will watch the teacher and learn from a comfortable seated position.

This journey has been great for me and I’ve enjoyed these last few practices a lot.

My body however Is def feeling the effects of a daily practice. Arms are fatigued and wrists a bit sore and some foot cramps. But also good things like I’m stronger and more toned.

I haven’t always done each class each day, like I would do some then miss a few days and have a catchup day where I’d do like 5 in a row! (Probs don’t recommend doing this again haha)

But I’m looking forward to the last practice and do feel a sense of coming HOME.

Keen to continue daily practice into FEB.
