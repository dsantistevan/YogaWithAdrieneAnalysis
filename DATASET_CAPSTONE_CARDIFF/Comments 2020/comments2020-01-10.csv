5.0,"""If you feel out of balance, just widen your base.""
This is one of my YWA favourites because it is the kind of yoga I can take off the mat. It taught me so much about life in general and my own presence in particular. It is chockful of Adriene wisdom and it helped me understand how if you truly want to reach for something, figuratively or literally, you need to soften and ground, find your base, figuratively and literally.

78.0,"At the beginning of today's class, I could not stand firm with my feet together. Towards the end, when you asked us to stand with our feet together on the last pose, I felt more grounded and I felt proud of myself! 

It was my first time to hear the saying ""The mat is your reflection"". When noticed that I had a harder time grounding or keeping my balance when I closed my eyes compared to when I gazed on somewhere, I realized that it somehow reflected my extroverted personality. At that point I realized the saying was true. It is a constant challenge for me to find grounding in life on my own and without other people. It is more natural for me to try to look out for other's opinion than to reflect on my own experiences and opinion. It is honestly not a bad thing that I am this way, but I would like to take it as a challenge to learn to let go, trust myself more and find grounding on my own. 

Like what I said before, I saw how I improved from the beginning to the end of today's class and I felt proud of myself. I remember that each individual goes through life and grows as a person at their own pace, like me, and so I should respect mine.

118.0,"This is my first time going through a committed yoga practice, and I am learning so much! One of the things I have begun to find myself doing is trying to find what feels good and comfortable in my body as a yoga beginner and as someone who is in a larger body. Instead of feeling frustrated, I've been searching for modifications or adjustments I can make so I feel supported but also am able to get something out of each pose! 

That being said, the cross-legged fold actually gave me a lot of difficulty! I have larger thighs, so when I crossed my legs I could only go so far, and I end up with no space between my two feet. This gave me a really tiny base to work with, and I felt wobbly and like my back knee in each move was really strained because I couldn't give it any bend.

Went to walk my dog, but she got distracted by all the other dogs out & about so she couldn't do her business & subsequently pooped in the house when we got back.  Then, when I go to start the video, I was put off by a standing start (one of my favorite things is sitting cross legged with you) and then the video started. 


Somehow, Adriene, you know what I need even before I do.  Thank you for reminding me to stay grounded in my own self and leading me on the search for inner peace.

Then I come back on the matt, and after my practice, I know what the problem was! My biggest problem is paying attention, and getting through the breathing exercises. I have massive ADHD and I absolutely hate sitting/ standing for a period of time because my mind starts to wonder so much, and I get distracted by literally everything in my room. I typically end up skipping some of the breathing exercises that consist of just sitting or standing, but I want to get through it.

593.0,"Here lately I've been feeling like I've been ""carrying someone else's groceries"" and have been angry and upset about it. Mad that I'm the one doing that and it always seems to fall to me. 

Adriene, you talking about doing this practice, this move, so that we can carry our own groceries ""when we're 80"" and ""someone else's groceries too"" was so powerful for me. I needed to hear that. I do keep myself strong (and we all know I don't mean just physically). I work with my mind and body to grow and persevere.  Others do not do that. Others don't have the time energy, discipline, softness, love that I do. No one will be like me, no one, ever. This sentiment allowed me to be grateful that I can, am able, and willing to carry someone else's groceries. My original reason, intent is out of love that I do it Thank you for reminding me of that.

""The mat is a mirror."" So true. How I treat myself, how I really think, how I really feel... when I'm on the mat, I see it. Truthfully, lovingly. I once told someone that my yoga, my mat is my church. And it is. I gain clarity, strength, and cultivate self love and awareness of my mind, body and soul on my mat. This practice, for me, is for life. And I wouldn't have it any other way. 

Love you, Adriene and Benji. Thanks for being a big part of this journey. Namaste",Ugy4tQ7EZMrSGXr76XN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-23T17:03:46Z,0.9978485107421875

670.0,"After what could be a huge disaster for me yesterday evening, having a yoga session with Adriene to wake up to in the morning is a big help. 
Last night we had really strong winds here in London, and while I was out for classes my window was blown open from its hinges- unfortunately, me being completely stupid I had a 5 litre bottle of water on the windowsill. That got knocked over onto my desk and when I returned home discovered everything completely drenched including the floor. As a result my laptop isn‚Äôt turning on- I‚Äôm currently leaving it to dry now although I fear I‚Äôve lost all of my dissertation research, all of my documents, and above all, 4 years worth of memories from finishing secondary school to my year abroad. I had also made lots of marathon training vlogs for my charity campaign YouTube channel- they might be gone too... Cloud storage also failed to sync with my files, so it‚Äôs all gone horribly wrong. I‚Äôm going to try to get my laptop working again later tonight after waiting 24hrs for it to dry. If it‚Äôs dead then these last months of university will be quite the challenge. I‚Äôm going for a run now and then after will spend the day in the library trying to rewrite my dissertation. Let‚Äôs hope this is the low point and that it‚Äôs only up from here",UgwdpXZyXXfNXO0cjft4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-01-15T09:59:24Z,-0.9996694326400757

710.0,"Yesterday was day two of my public yoga experience.


I was mostly in my own way and I lost breath in more than a few transitions and it's something that returns throughout my journey. 



Kaitlin asked how the experience was after class, and the only thing I could think to comment about was a lack of Oxygen. 



Sometimes it takes a few tries getting comfortable and linking breathe to movement. 



Like settling into a new position, or book.


Chapter's have transitions, but books change the settings.

726.0,"I really want to like these and appreciate that she does them every day. Definitely a good way to build a practice  However. There are 2-3 minutes at the beginning that are unhelpful and just Adrienne hearing herself talk. Then, throughout the video there is no background music and she talks constantly. Which can be helpful if it‚Äôs pose improvements, but instead she talks about her dog, herself, what we probably think of her... this drives me berserk. Additionally, she spends so much time talking about random things that sometimes you‚Äôre stuck in a pose. She‚Äôll start to tell you  to do something on your next breath but by the time she is done making a comment about something irrelevant, you‚Äôve taken three breaths in the middle of a pose you can‚Äôt finish because Benji walked in the room and threw off the flow.",Ugyeue_BC28aOh2V2E94AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-01-13T13:17:53Z,-0.9878237247467041

As I have been practicing with more consistency I notice that my dog (who is getting older and who is blind) has started coming up to my mat to sit with me while i do my spiritual practice. I live with relatives that are fighting pretty often and my dog will usually run to me for a comforting presence when that happens. Even though he cant see anymore he can tell when my energy is in a space to come to the mat and he feeds off of it so he can get some relief from his daily pains and struggle. His sweet soul adds an extra motivation to my coming to the mat and it really means the world as I absolutely love the energy animals give off. 

I've even done energy work on him as he gets very anxious and shakey and whenever I see that I will tune in and give him some loving energy. As soon as I feel source energy running out through my hands he stops shaking and gives me kisses.
