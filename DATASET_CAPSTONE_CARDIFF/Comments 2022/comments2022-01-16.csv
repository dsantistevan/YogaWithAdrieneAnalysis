15.0,day 15 and 16 I struggled with. I found them challenging and I was out of breath and this normally doesnt happen with me. I kept falling out of the poses.

31.0,"Hi, Adriene.

First of all I would like to Thank You for posting these videos. The 30 day Yoga Journey came to me at the right time.
Second - today was a very special day due to the discovery I noticed. I know for a fact that my spine is crooked and that leads to several issues, on of them being often headache, dizziness, black outs. I know that my 3td to 5th vertebrae are a offset since I was a kid.
I have noticed that my face stays white after moderate walks or runs, which tells me that the blood circulation to the head isn't good. I tend to get a little redness in my cheeks only after intense workouts.
So today when doing Sweet 16 it really turned out super sweet because of the sensations I had. When doing One-Legged Tadasana I felt a deep stretch, did 5 breaths on on leg once I lowered my leg and stood in the Mountain pose my head was dizzy like crazy, but in a good way, I couldn't see for a sec and had a powerful heat wave. I was a little familiar with the feeling but never been able to get to it deliberately. So then I repeated the same pose with the other leg and same thing happened, then switched again - same thing happened. I did 5 times each leg and same sensations happened. I felt like I had released some old entrenched tension that I have had for years - so again THANK YOU!
I will keep continue the Journey and hopefully release more tension points to get to a better version of myself!

Paldies!

p.s. I Skipped day 14 due to my lazy ass, did day 14 and day 15 on day 15 :)

You always encourage us to move slowly, and well, as the baby guinea pig adjusts, she is alone in an enclosure in the room where I do yoga. Any quick movements startle her and she runs and hides. As I did yoga today, I was extra careful to move slowly in an effort to calm her. She came out and adventured a few times as I did yoga. I like to think that moving like you’re trying not to startle a baby guinea pig is a healthy pace for me some days. ☺️☺️",UgxzS-IOF3obQdSUg2V4AaABAg,0.0,13.0,2022-01-31T20:56:47Z,0.9957203269004822

But Everytime I try to do one of these on footed poses I knock stuff over or I can't keepy balance and it really gets to me and all I can think about is how I just bombed that pose and I can't relax. Maybe I have the wrong body type for yoga , idk. What I do know is I don't feel relaxed or refreshed. With that being said I am enjoying my yoga journey and I would like to thank you for making these videos.

116.0,"I have to honour my body and share that I have injured my back on a number of the yoga days this year during “move”. I am encouraged by some of the bigger and larger yogis who also experience difficulties in some of the moves and who have voiced their concerns. I have practiced yoga on and off for what seems like lifetimes, it will be 25 years or more now. So many times I have had injuries to my back that I need to reconvene and discuss with myself what works. For example strength training and weight training are so nourishing for me and I rarely get injured. I also have to play these yoga videos without sound this year, so I do not have to listen to the overly dramatic presentation. This channel is obviously not for me anymore but I have definitely benefited in the past. So thank you 🙏🏼 but I am moving on to something more authentic for me.

I make adjustments to find what feels good, and I honor when perhaps a half moon isn't possible. I took some days off after an injury instead of toughing it out, and I loving every new thing I learn about my body through movement.  Today I even brought sunglasses to the mat, so when I am on my back I don't get blinded by the light in the ceiling XD. Where ever you are in your journey, I send big hugs and love to you.

But I began to breathe deeply and I fell asleep. Also, at the end of practice, you said to notice if we are holding in the neck, shoulders, hips, thighs, ankles, calfs, toes, hands, or fingers. Just then I noticed I was holding...my breath. That is exactly what I was doing when the Angel told me to Breathe...I was holding my breath. But, the hope is, I noticed it.

283.0,"I did today's practice hours ago this morning but had to run so I didn't comment on it, but I just wanted to celebrate the evidence of progress that I found in this! I hardly fell while in those balancing poses. I fell a little when I was first lifting my leg, but I focused and breathed and called upon all of the vocabulary I've learned this month and in the past year, and I flew!! I flew. It was wobbly, and there were several moments when I felt like this was it, and I was gonna fall, but I chose to focus instead on breathing and lifting and grounding, and I FLEW instead. Ever since Day 12's FOCUS theme, things have changed. On the mat and off the mat. I learned so much, and I'm coming to realize in a new way the power and ability that I possess.

I was off balance today. I couldn't hit poses I once could. But that's ok - it's because my heart was off balance today and was reflecting that in my yoga. So I will honor that, and show up tomorrow, and the next day just the same.

As beginner, I think I over exerted my body and I didn’t pay as much attention as I should have in every position; that’s a lesson learned.

It’s a very peaceful experience and one that I cherish every chance we get to do it. Maybe that inner peace is what I’m welcoming in each time.

592.0,"Yoga still isn't something that I'm sure is for me. I like the flexibility and strength I gain, but a lot of the mental components don't resonate with me. Yet I still can't stop myself from returning to Adriene's videos, particularly these 30 day January journeys. This is (by far) the furthest I've ever made it through a series, and I'm shocked at how 20-25 minutes has gone from feeling like an eternity to feeling like a warm up. 

I'll look up at the screen expecting to find that we're at the halfway point, and realize that there's only four minutes left and we're winding down for the day. When I started, I had to split day one into two parts, and now I'm looking at the rest of the videos on this channel to get another practice in because 20 minutes doesn't feel like enough. 

Even without being great at the meditative aspects, there is so much to be gained from following along with a series like this. It's nuts lol",UgzsN5FsF3vEEdz6MhR4AaABAg,11.0,110.0,2022-01-17T11:08:56Z,-0.8076619505882263

644.0,"FAST ANCHOR'D ETERNAL O LOVE!

FAST-ANCHOR'D eternal O love! O woman I love!

O bride! O wife! more resistless than I can tell, the thought of
you!

Then separate, as disembodied or another born,

Ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation,

I ascend, I float in the regions of your love O man,

O sharer of my roving life.
