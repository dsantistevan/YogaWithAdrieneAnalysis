106.0,"I did it. I did my best and that was enough. Thing is, I was so onboard with this yoga journey since the day it started. I‚Äôve been doing yoga for about 2-3 years and have had a regularly practice for about a year now, but i woke up feeling a bit sick on day 3 and said I would just do this session after work instead of in the morning so I could get some extra rest. That didn‚Äôt happen because I felt sicker at night and by day 4 I was horribly sick. Turns out I had Covid. I was taking good care of myself but I‚Äôm also immunocompromised due to medicine I took for a flare up in my autoimmune disease. I got over the symptoms in about 5 days, but had a sinus infection the week after. And since being sick, I have been dealing with fatigue. However, a friend of mine told me that napping wouldn‚Äôt help fatigue as much, and that, instead, take it easy don‚Äôt overwork and try to get moving gradually. So last week I decided I felt okay enough to restart this journey, even if it takes more than 30 days. Move is perfect because it eases us into yoga and it seems like everyone who finished it felt much stronger when they finished! Although I‚Äôm bummed I couldn‚Äôt practice live with everyone and i‚Äôm rather disheartened because i don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in my own body (seriously‚Ä¶I used to be able to do a lot of this with strength, grace, and a smile on my face, but now? It‚Äôs so hard for meüòì), I‚Äôm glad this journey is available to everyone for free. Adriene, thank you for all you do.

It is a struggle to find the time, I'm sure I'm not the only with one with that problem. The benefits of reconnecting with myself are so far reaching and I'm kicking myself for not making it easier yet world, life demands, kids etc are so pressing at times stealing that  half an hour on the mat is like rocking horse shit.

445.0,"Wow Adriene, you are magic! The visualizations are so meaningful and effective, at least to me and I am sure to a lot of others. Examples: You are this energy body that is reaching far beyond the yoga mat when we were doing the warrior 2 I believe. And, pick any colour, paint with your hands as you bring them back and let go of whatever..in the knees joint child's pose. And, the last seated stretch...you decide how you move in life...You have such a helpful way to explain the details. For example: as your palsm press down, your shins are moving forward in the bridge pose. I can't thank you enough. One other thing I wanted to point out, I feel absolutely no guilt, no pressure, no anxiety of being about 7 days late in this Move 30 day challenge. You let off no such energy that would create any kind of such stress. I typically never care for meeting celebrities, and yes, for me, you are a celebrity, but you are also a friend, who stirs deep, positive, happy things in me. I dream to meet you one day and have tea after a good yoga session!!!! Take care, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. O",UgzXVGxxJOZ2kuhFid14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-10T16:27:15Z,0.9996498823165894

I've never been able to do yoga every single day for 30 days before so I felt so crushed and guilty that I was missing a day and this would also not be the year I would fully do the challenge but everyone is different and chronic pain doesn't care what your plans are.

""Did I really do this video?"" which made me realize I finally do not need to look at you anymore after almost 4 months of yoga with you. I am an absolute beginner at yoga. I have only tried your videos because I dislike the glossy earrings, music or fancy sculpted yoga teachers as they distract me from the simplicity and the right mindset. 4 months in, I feel my core really tight and I love how my body has slowly progressed to moving from down dog to lunges with INTENTION with more flexibility and with minimal effort. I also love how I do these yoga postures throughout my day from the kitchen to the bedroom. The practice has taken a life of its own.

945.0,"""You get to decide how you move in life.""
This. This is why I love YWA! In a society that pressures us to move in very specific ways (ways which are often rigid and practiced on a basis of self-punishment), YWA rejects generalization and gives the individual the power to determine what feels good on a given day. We are not static, and our needs change. Movement is not a one-size-fits-all (what is, really?), and that is the beauty of being human.",Ugxh0HWictZiytKFyzp4AaABAg,1.0,73.0,2022-01-05T07:14:29Z,0.9990562796592712

Here is just one tip from me to you:
While we are doing the postures, can you just stop talking about other things? It just makes me feel as if I am in the posture forever, especially if the posture is a hard one. When you talk while on the posture about other things, it makes me want to give up, and it makes it harder for me.

I almost didnt come today. 
It's 10 pm now. Im glad we are here.
 ""Show up and see what happens"" (thats from a practice we did last year).
I no longer wish to control. 
Im doing the best i can. And that might look worst from what I've already done. 
Happiness is only real when shared. Maybe the point of it all IS connection. Presence. 
Maybe the meaning Im so desperately looking for is this exact second. 
Maybe the meaning is experiencing life frame by frame. Even if that's scary. Even if it feels pointless (climate crises anxiety anyone?).

Truth is, I have my coffee with cream and agave, ate a grilled cheese sandwich for breakfast, worked out of the hospital all day as I sat with my sister (discharged today thank God) and came home to more things that needed to be done. Letting go served me well because I usually put off my exercise if I don‚Äôt get it done in the morning, yet, here I am just finishing after 7PM, still have to cook dinner and eat. I got on the mat.

1251.0,"Thanks Adriene (and Benji, of course)! My third day of yoga ever, done!

A few reflections from me: First of all, on a practical note, the hints about when it might be useful to glance at the screen were very helpful! Since all of this is new to me, there's a risk I end up trying to hold poses while cricking my neck to stare at the screen!

Second, that session felt physically easier than day 2 for me, in terms of holding the poses. If anything, that allowed me to focus more on my breathing. At some point - I think about 17:01 in the video - I inhaled and was suddenly very much aware that the inhalation was pushing me sideways with how it made my body move. I felt particularly aware of the way my breath was making my body move, then, in a way that's quite unlike anything I've done before.

Third, in child's pose (I think it was called?) at the end, a light behind me was being reflected in my glasses, and the reflection was changing from red-tinted to green-tinted as I inhaled and exhaled and changed the position of my head and the lenses ever so slightly.

THAT is the feeling i love from yoga. that realization AFTER i do something challenging-- that feeling when i didnt even notice how strong i was being. thank you for this one, adriene.

1419.0,"For all the times I've heard Adriene say that 'we're here to practise' through the different 30 day journeys, I'm only recently understanding how important it is to bring that mindset on the mat and keep it. Without it, drifting off into self-criticism is all too easy:

'God damn, can't do that', 'Shit, I haven't done that right either, ffs she just explained it', 'Why can't I breathe deeply in this posture, what am I doing wrong?', 'I did this way better last time', 'You're holding your breath again you clown!' etc, etc, etc. 

All it's about is being yourself on that day, whatever that is mentally and physically, and to observe it. That's where the goodies come from. Keep it up everyone!",UgzyQSXCavh8rfdAwDN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-04T20:23:02Z,0.7759689092636108

I started doing yoga irregularly over the past year (increased from 1-2 sessions a week to 3-5), now I'll try to MOVE with you through the whole month! Practicing yoga with your videos gave me quite some understanding of my body and improved my fitness overall. I'm glad for that opportunity and the challenges you give us.

I love how mindful the MOVE challenge is so far and how many useful advice you give throughout the videos, especially the detailed positioning advice and variations.
Already some of my favorite practices and looking forward to try and stick through the rest of them with you!

I am dealing with a hip injury and have done research to see what to do and what avoid and how to modify. If something hurts, don‚Äôt do it. You can hurt yourself. Instead, remember the name of the pose and research it. You may just need some tips or it may not be right for you.
