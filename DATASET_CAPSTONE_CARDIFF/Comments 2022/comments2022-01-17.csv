80.0,"Thank you Adriene!!  I have been following Yoga with Adrienne since 2011!  At age 64, a diagnosis of cancer (leiomyosarcoma), major pelvic surgery and radiation prevented me from attending my usual yoga classes for several weeks - which is when I found Adrienne.  Since then I have had three metastases - lung, rib, and now both lungs again - more surgery and more radiation (5” of 11th rib removed) and have continued to follow and NEED Adrienne, even when I did return to local classes.  I not only follow her 30 day journeys but choose many others in between as needed.   My doctors feel that yoga has helped my mind and body stay strong.  Without Adriene I would not have continued my yoga practices.  Now I am 75, and as todays mantra states…. I am strong.  Again, thank you Adriene!",Ugyt_6tvIx9JCCpRHpZ4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-02-01T17:11:27Z,0.9984366297721863

I decided ahead that if I couldn't make it to the mat I'd treat myself with loving kindness and just pick up where I left off whenever I could.

760.0,"Day 17. We did it! A truly loving practice. I feel that sometimes that time alone with oneself is really needed. As one goes through their day, a lot of emotion can build up whether that’s in the body or in the mind and this time is a loving way to recognise the emotions perhaps and allow that time to just…be. This practice was much needed, we have been battling with the virus here and I was feeling quite unwell before I started, took some medication and came the mat. Still laying down as we speak! But getting there. Thank you all for sharing this practice with me here today.
