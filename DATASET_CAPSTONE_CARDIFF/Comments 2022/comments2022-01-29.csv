19.0,I've done multiple 30 days of Yoga over the last two years and all taught me something new. This one taught me that it's okay to take my time. I had to stop at day five or six because of some kind of covid relapse and wasn't able to do yoga for like a week. But instead of throwing the towel I restarted from day one and now I did day 29. Some videos I had to stop and try again the next day. Some days life happened and I just couldn't do it. That's okay.

38.0,"I am not gonna lie, I got a little teary-eyed at the end of this video. I did Breath last year for 30 days of YWA and I remember I cried at the end of that one. I probably will when I finish the last practice of this too üòÖ 

It's just... so impowering that so many people all join together to work towards the same goals, as well as personal ones. We are all at different levels from different backgrounds and parts of the world, and we still manage to come together in such a beautiful way.

Just when I think you're done surprising me, Adriene... this practice was amazing in all the right ways and even though we switched things up a little, I loved it. From the moment we whispered at the beginning of this practice I knew it would hit a little different. And it did, but it was comfortable. It allowed for me to look back at why I am here. Why I started this. Why I do yoga.

So many things said, thought, or felt on the mat can also apply to me religiously, and through my practices I do find myself feeling closer to God. I feel more connected to the Holy Spirit, and I am able to set myself on a better track.

I have also learned this year that jumping on the mat for a bit can help with anger. I might not be able to run for sport anymore, but I can do some yoga.

74.0,"I've been doing this series since I came home from the hospital while I recover from covid pneumonia a month ago.  Without a doubt, Adrienne and Benji have been a HUGE part of my return to health and recovery.  This has changed my life.  I take what I have learned on the mat and journal on it at the end of the day.  Can't believe it's been 29 days already.  I'd like to express gratitude and appreciation for Adrienne and Benji and for the community of people practicing yoga here.   As an athlete and gym rat, and at age 55, it's been hard to have to start over again.  But that's what life is all about... stripping away all the things we thought are important, in order to get to the higher purpose.

118.0,"My system of Dynamic Meditation starts with breathing, because breathing has deep roots in the being. You may not have observed that breathing is very special in many ways. Your body has two types of systems. One system is voluntary, another system is nonvoluntary. I can move my hand voluntarily, but I cannot influence my blood circulation. That is nonvoluntary . Your body is made of these two types of systems - the voluntary and the nonvoluntary. You can do something with it: you can take deep breaths; you can take slow breaths. You can change the rhythm; you can even stop breathing for a few minutes or a few seconds. But it is still in between. You cannot stop it forever. It is a link between the voluntary and the nonvoluntary  systems of your body.
If you can change your breathing, you can change many things with it. If you can observe your breathing minutely, you can detect in yourself many things. When you are angry you have a different rhythm of breathing; when you are in love, a totally different rhythm comes to you. When you are relaxed you breathe differently; when you are tense you breathe differently. You cannot breathe the way you do when you are relaxed and be angry at the same time. That is impossible.
When you are sexually aroused, your breathing changes. If you do not allow the breathing to change, your sexual arousal will drop automatically. That means that breathing is deeply related to your mental state. If you change your breathing, you can change the state of your mind. Or, if you change the state of your mind, breathing will change.
