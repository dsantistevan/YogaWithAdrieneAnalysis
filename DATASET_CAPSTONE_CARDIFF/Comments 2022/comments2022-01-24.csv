0.0,"I am processing a lot of emotions today, especially sadness and fear. I am impressed how this practice has shown me how important the focus on the present moment is. I NEVER have been so good in the balancing postures, because I found so much comfort in breathing and focusing on the balance. It was so comforting, I can‚Äôt explain it. like a silent way of ‚ÄúI am here fir you‚Äù, which my body, breath and mind told me. This sounds very spiritual but being able to stand in such a challenging posture so calmly and comfortable, it made me realize that I will go through everything. It‚Äôs going to be okay. Processing it, one emotion, one thought, one action, one word at the time. Slow healing.",UgyzlnKmBVRGueCUFZJ4AaABAg,5.0,392.0,2022-01-25T10:30:20Z,0.9990667700767517

13.0,"I don't usually comment on YouTube videos, for (rational or irrational) deep rooted fear of public embarrassment or saying something someone might take out of context and twist around to humiliate me. But I just felt compelled by spirit to say something, and hopefully it reaches you. 
I have been watching and practicing with your videos for about 2 years now, but this is my first total follow through on a ""30 day"" journey. I'm talking religiously getting up at the same time every morning and doing this for myself, come hell or high water. And I just want to thank you. From the bottom of my soul, thank you for being who you are, doing what you do and the way that you do it, and for sharing it with the world. 
I just finished the ""Process"" video this morning (late to the party, I know) and I just want to talk about this amazing, almost cathartic experience I had on my mat. Actually kind of broke down and cried a little bit in the middle of this video because I had this moment where I had the thought in my head, ""why do I struggle with my body so much? My body can do such amazing things.""

281.0,"Yikes!! This video has 151K views in just over 16hrs‚Ä¶ which at first seemed like so freaking many to me!! Haha but, then I was thinking, hmmm I wonder if there is a noticeable amount of ppl who have stopped showing up over 3 weeks in. So I looked back to check the views for Day 1‚Ä¶. And OMG as of Jan 25, 2022 Day 1 of Move currently has MORE THAN TWO POINT SIX MILLION VIEWS!!!! Wow! That is A LOT of good intentions!! Congrats Adriene & Congrats to each & every person who has committed to this & has continued to show up for yourself. 

Deciding to do this journey, holding myself accountable, showing up for myself & understanding the true value of a moment has been my biggest take away this year! I‚Äôve noticing the difference in how I move (no pun intended) both how I move my body & how I move through life has shifted. I am so much more aware of how I am breathing & have been practicing a number of different types of breathing exercises *free gifts included w/ your commitment to this journey*  realizing I‚Äôve slowed down & been able to more intentionally observe the little things in life. 

To anyone reading this comment, curious if this is the right video for you, the answer is always Yes! Whatever video you stumble on, whatever time you give yourself, take full advantage & continue to show up for yourself.  Xo üíú

After practice, in shavasana I started thinking about how we, us humans, have to process loneliness, and how it manifests in so many various ways. Then the tears came as I thought about the distance, and difficulty in communicating with our Creator...It just shouldn't be that difficult, nor the distance so far. I gradually calmed down and remembered that I do have a relationship with God, but there is a PROCESS of growth and inner healing that comes from interpersonal relationships with others that will allow me to experience more of God, in a deeper way. Yes, our shared journey is a beautiful gift to allow us, globally, to process, and be present with each other, in a higher place.

402.0,"Dearest Adriene,
Thank you once again. Today for this practice. It felt GREAT! 
Today it is my grandmother's birthday. We lost her in the early spring last year, 94 years old and satisfied with a long, wonderful, privileged and happy life. But I won't stop missing her because even though she was okay with ending the earthly life at that time, it does not mean that I was ready to stop learning from her and ready to stop loving her. So I try to keep doing that - loving and learning from her - and we are getting together in the family in her spirit this afternoon. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Just so you know, I really listen to the images that you create verbally, and they resonate in me physically and mentally. Images as ""press every four corners of your feet to the mat as if you're trying to tear the mat in two down the middle"" makes sense to me intellectually but at the same time I feel it  in the body directly when you describe it. That's what makes it powerful! üôèüí™‚ú® ""If that doesn't feel awesome... Try..."" üòÜüòçMany hugs and love to Benji for being your calm and cute assistant whom really pulls everything down to Earth if we are flying just a little to high. üòÑ ‚ù§Ô∏è

409.0,So I am three days behind on this journey due to timing and the choice to ride my fat bike on a beautiful cold MN day in place of my yoga because doing both would have been too much.  in the past I would have double up my practice and pushed too hard so that  I could keep up with my goal of completing this challenge 30 days in a row.  What I am learning is this practice is NOT about getting it done but learning something about myself along the way.  So today I am heading to move-22 and I will be A OKAY with being behind.

419.0,"last year was my first year doing the 30 days and it helped me find the courage to seek a diagnosis for a mental health disorder. having that diagnosis has helped me immensely but it's made me even more keenly aware of the tightrope i walk: on the one hand, i need a strict routine, checklists, workouts, sleeping schedule, etc in order to function - and yet i am much more susceptible to becoming overtired and burning out and so i also need to give myself lots of time to rest and recuperate. this last week i've started to notice myself teetering on the brink of burnout, starting to get lazy about good habits and slip back into bad ones, a pattern that has previously signaled the start of a depressive episode. this ""process"" practice gave me the space to, well, process that, to sift through how i've been feeling, to think about what serves me and what just tires me out. i didn't come to any answers but the balance flow offered such a beautiful model of what i'm trying to achieve and allowed me to be kind to myself and have some perspective on where i'm at in my ... yeah ... process.

We recently had a set back and it shook us to our core, however we have decided to accept this change and to focus on progress rather than perfection, as we believe a small change is better than no change at all. This mindset and shift in thinking is largely in part to the strength we've experienced from meditation and yoga. We owe our yoga journey to Adrienne's first 30-day journey as this was the first time we really opened ourselves to the experience.

When I pulled my left hip crease back, I felt  it fully do so for the first time ever. Lifting the left leg later, I still felt the inner thigh tighten. Always seems to happen on that side with the tight hip and hamstring. I wish I could get it to loosen up. In any case, it does not affect the rest of the pose. If I had to simply stand there with leg raised though, it would reach a point in which I simply would have to move it around. Wonderful practice overall today. I loved it.
