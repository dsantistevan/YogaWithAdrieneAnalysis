7.0,"Just started doing yoga with this 30 day journey! I never really gave it a try before and now I think I’ve found a workout I actually love? I never though I’d see the day... and honestly I don’t even want to just call it a workout bc it’s so much more. This is one of the only workouts I’ve done where I genuinely don’t feel like I should be doing it to lose weight or look a certain way, I genuinely feel like Adriene wants me to get stronger and build a connection with my body.

28.0,"Maybe comfort means something different. Like giving some responsibilities over to someone that can help you. Or to make space and time for yourself and maybe putting someone else first before self so we can give them some time, but then giving ourselves undivided attention as well. 
Maybe nourishment means we are allowing ourselves the ability to have something all to ourselves wether it’s just a listing ear, or something a bit indulgent. Just something that makes us feel a sense of encouragement and a sense of filling the gaps in our being. Abide has great meditations on YouTube here, and it’s a wonderful accompaniment to the yoga series for more restful sleep, and that makes almost all the difference, when the body and mind starts to feel better from yoga, and the soul has time to rest and really reflect and do what it needs to do while sleeping. Waking up refreshed and doing life so much more accomplished and efficient with confidence, is and amazing feeling, maybe just from this one branch of our days carved out but so truly meaningful!

449.0,"I have been practicing yoga with Adriene and others for years and I think of myself as an intermediate learner. However after contracting Covid in dec 2021, I have struggled to do intermediate practices. It’s been a while since I “recovered”, the equivalent of testing negative, but I still suffer from shortness of breath and my body feels lacking in strength. I was only able to start this series two days ago. On the first, I collapsed and had to give myself a few more days. I now come to the mat as if this is my first time doing yoga, I try to take it easy and forget how far I was in my pre- Covid practices. What I love about this annual series and yoga in general is the sense of a possibility of new beginnings. It allows me to forget what came before and I am trying to overcome that feeling of regression because of sickness, and start again. I completed my third day today with no judgements towards myself. I feel like a “beginner” again, and I am trying to embrace that. With yoga, everyday is a new beginning, and we have to meet ourselves where we are, not through some preconceived notions of beginner, intermediate, and advanced. I learned this from Adriene years ago, and I have never appreciated this more than now.",UgymaYF7oYe5a-1qumF4AaABAg,0.0,9.0,2022-01-09T17:52:51Z,-0.9347125887870789

I have seen the question here and there on some of the videos, if you want to slow down the playback speed to do the practice at your own speed, here is how to do it.
Hit the 3 dots at the top right corner and choose “Playback speed”. Usually it should be set to Normal, but you can change it to either faster (1.25x to 2x) or slower (0.75x to 0.25x).
Be aware a human voice might sound a bit strange when playback speed is changed, but at least you can do the practice at your own speed.

527.0,"I love this yoga challenge and all Adriene’s practices are done nicely and with care but…I think that, especially for beginners, there’s something missing: a little stretching session at the end, especially for the glutes. Remember to always stretch, after you do any kind of workout, otherwise it may have bad consequences on your muscles. I always stretch a bit longer after Adriene’s practices, especially the glutes as I have noticed she has a tendency to neglect them and that’s where I mostly hold tension. But I’m not a beginner and I know exactly how to do it…So maybe listen to your body and follow up with another gentle stretchy practice.",UgydyeL0QpTkUs24Vf54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-09T08:22:06Z,-0.9827589392662048

I felt a tremendous amount of happiness and pride for finishing and now after day 7s practice I feel calm and relaxed. I find it hard to be proud of myself and often seek it from others, but today something clicked and I felt so proud and so loved by myself. A very beautiful day.

729.0,"Nourish. What a beautiful word. Something that we tend to just pass by when we are so focused on the exterior or the material world. Practicing yoga and learning from Adriend, has taught me to reconnect to my center, to my interior. Nourishment for me is tending to my soul, my body, and my mind. I am nourished as I show up on the mat and this sweet day 7 practice has been a great reminder to continue showing up - to nourish and to love myself deeply. I am here.

My dog passed away a month ago and it has been really hard for me to accept, but what you said really made me feel his presence. I imagined he was just next to me, gave him a little pet and (for real, like even physically) felt his warmth in my body and through the whole practice. It really made me realize that I can do this more often, in my daily life and whenever I think of him. So thank you very much! See you tomorrow. :)

I find comfort in action. Anything I do, is better than nothing. So I'm showing up for myself. Every day. To eat. To rest. To flow, taking back little bits of myself. I'm watching how I think, in the silent spaces between people.  I fuel that desire, urge to put in some work. Knowing I must sacrifice alot of the older me, for something that serves. To achieve a greater me. Tempering my choice with patience and understanding, I am healing.

Today was the second day where I found myself smiling, feeling a reconnection to my childhood (the moment happened on the shake the arms and legs at the end).
One of my goals with this journey is to move in the direction of discovering myself, and feeling more comfortable with me, my body and my thoughts. One would think that this is a movement forward, but I find myself moving in all directions, exploring and discovering way more than I expected.

1026.0,"Hello!
Last year i was in a period where I hated doing any type of exercise,  because I got too obsessed with weights and fat percentage and VOMax and what not. In september a friend recommended me trying yoga, especifically the Breath 30 days series from last year. Because I was still in a rough patch, It took me to the 28th of December to finish the series, but I did it. 
This year  however I had done seven out of the seven days, and next week probably I'll go back to the gym but with a more relaxed attitude. When Adriene said at the end ""because you showed up"" I teared up because that is what I want for my relationship with exercise, just to show up not caring about peak performance or numbers, just to move and have a nourishing time.

So thank you so much for this series, and for teaching me that there is a mentally healthy way to do exercise <3",UgzyX1L6cYyqeubBI714AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-08T16:54:42Z,0.7693473696708679

Thankfully the pause button comes in handy, especially when the dog joins in, and not the way Benji does it!

1143.0,"I’m so glad I signed up for Move. Prior to the pandemic I had been practicing 3-4 times a week at an intermediate level for a number of years. This was at a gym, so there were different instructors different styles at different levels of intermediate with no attempt to coordinate or design a practice structure or progression. I’m not complaining—new members arrived all the time and classes needed to be accessible to all—but I never had the sense that I was advancing physically or spiritually (though I did become more flexible). The pandemic disrupted my routine, like everyone’s, and I hadn’t built the discipline to stick to a schedule on my own, consequently my practice devolved quickly. When I did make time it was usually for a yin class—which is great, but I lost much of my ability to flow, to balance. I had found Yoga with Adriene through The NY Times and really liked it so when I heard about this 30-day plan I thought I would see if I could return to a more dedicated practice.  I am surprised already by what a difference it is making, as if there really is some kind of muscle memory both mental and physical. I try to follow the Move session with a meditation. And I’m planning to become a member of Yoga with Adriene when it has completed. I’ve tried a couple of other online yoga instructors, but they are usually focused exclusively on progressing toward more advanced physical asanas with little attention to mind or spirit. Adriene’s super balanced, warm—loving, actually—approach makes it so much more inviting to “show up on the mat” every day. She is a marvel, an evolved being.",Ugwyl4ATV_hdW2mEFAN4AaABAg,0.0,11.0,2022-01-08T14:54:21Z,0.8187530636787415

The elbow on the knee move was the killer for today though because my belly and thighs wouldn't let me be great. It's ok... I feel good about getting on the mat and happy that I prioritized it first this morning. I did note that my mind was less anxious about the practice today. I am not sure if it was because today is Saturday in my part of the world, if it was that I saw the practice was only 22 mins or if my mind is getting more comfortable with the concept of movement. Whichever it was, I invite that feeling to return because the struggle in my mind is sometimes worse than the struggle with my body on this mat.  Thanks for a week of mindful tutelage.

I love how you wrote ""Ssmall flutters of joy"" in your email :-) 
I have been doing each days practice, even after 9 hour workdays and once even on a full body at 9:30pm Currently on day 2 of my 5 day quarantine at home ( everyone healthy and save but as a kindergarten teacher it had to come to it eventually) I am doing a previous one first and then the practice of the day followed by one practice from past years. I would love a deep 45 minute Yoga Nidra in the future please. Now, I am going to continue mindful writing essays for 2 hours and then 3 other practices before I hit the shower before dinner.
Do you share recipes and nutrition? I loved Ahimsa Yoga video, thank you!And of course, I love Benji! I miss my dog so much! Many hugs!

Personal highlights: 
Benji's relaxed sigh at the beginning
The 'hands together and elbow into outer thigh' twists
Adriene describing the legs and arms up position on back as a 'dead bug,' laughed out loud a bit for this one

As usual, the strategic breathing with movements brought awareness to my breath. Sometimes i don't breathe 'properly,' and take shallow breaths. This reminder to breathe deep helps off the mat.

When it comes to breath - should I breathe into my stomach where my belly expands? or into the chest? Because in some postures Adriene speaks about breathing into the belly but I am unsure if she means literally or as imagery to help people not move their shoulders as much.

ALSO - ""relax your shoulder"". My natural posture is slouched when relaxed. Or does she mean push the shoulders down and back?",Ugy5vTOQuTgk9hJTxqZ4AaABAg,3.0,4.0,2022-01-08T09:45:32Z,-0.9977630376815796
