9.0,Tears. I started this journey about a month ago but had to stop due to emergency surgery. I was told to rest & heal for 4 weeks. Doctor finally approved light workouts! I picked up where I last left off and today was such a perfect transition back into moving. I didn't notice some of your words in your previous videos until I really needed to hear it today. You speak with so much kindness and patience. Your voice helped veer not only my physical body but my emotional body to letting go and healing.

I also realized that I'm always trying to breathe like Adrianne, which is great, but I mean, I'm always trying to catch up which is such a habit of mine when I can simply be in tune with my own rhythm and how I'm breathing.

158.0,"I cannot describe in words the sensation of Euphoria I felt at the end of this practice today. 

I know I‚Äôm behind a few days, but after practicing the first day, I felt drawn to the concept of moving towards a healthier relationship with myself, my thoughts, and my body.

And it‚Äôs not like this is the first time I‚Äôve tried working on these relationships within myself, but everytime I tried to connect with myself deeper, it always felt like I was missing a practice that would truly create more space for myself.

After 3 days, I began focusing on what it means to truly be who I am, and to do everything I can each day to move towards a healthier relationship with me.

It was when you said ‚ÄúPart of my practice that has really motivated me to keep moving is this ever-evolving ‚Ä¶ constant deeping to this relationship with myself‚Äù that it really clicked. 

The missing link between this attempt of me moving towards myself and me doing so in the past, is that this time, I‚Äôm physcially moving my body each day towards this better relationship.

Learning body control from you (and Benji of course) has helped me recognize my body. Resulting in a greater sense of presence in my every day life. Never before did I believe I could move like this, now it feels like I‚Äôm just beginning.

I really do keep myself distracted with the outside world as much as possible. It has been my way of self soothing because of all my trauma and anxiety. Honestly just living in my body is really difficult at times, basically every day, and for some reason yoga seems to help. I don't understand the science behind it but I am doing my best to dedicate every day to yoga...with Adriene. I cant do yoga with any other person online lol

860.0,"This is my third year delighting in yoga with Adriene and in particular, the 30 day journey. In the past when she would say "" Meet yourself where you're at"" or, ""Find what feels good"", I didn't fully integrate those wise words until this 30 day challenge. I have been experiencing vertigo for a few years but after recovering from Covid, it has gotten much worse. In particular, when the weather changes, as it did up here in northern Idaho a few days ago, it gets pretty gnarly ( the vertigo) - the weather too! So these past couple of days while doing the yoga journey I have had to completely ""meet myself where I am at"" and it has been freeing and glorious. instead of dropping out because I couldn't practice in the way I am used to, I have grace and gratitude for what I can do. Wonders never cease!

It's only been five days of practice for me, but I can already tell a difference in my movement on the mat - there's a new, but welcome, lightness and a gentleness that I hope I can find off the mat sometime soon, too.

871.0,"My goal last year was to do Yoga every single day. And I did it! I am chronically ill and it was a challenge. One I am grateful I was able to accomplish as I know many in my position simply couldn't. 
This year, I decided to push myself a little more and, to the best of my ability, stick to what Adriene chooses for the day! Whether it be 10 minutes or 40 minutes. (I always copped out on 40 minute videos and did one that was 5-10.) 
I am seeing how I am more capable of handling these longer videos though, because I did yoga every day!
We are moving, and I am having to do a great deal of work a family member is much sicker than I am. And I am seeing how yoga has kept me strong, and is keeping me going as I do this. These minutes are precious during these chaotic, exhausting days. But I can feel the yoga loosening up the tight muscles, keeping me from getting too sore and too exhausted. I feel myself getting stronger and it's a miracle.
Adriene, thank you. Finding your channel a few years ago has changed my life. I regularly write down your name when I am writing in my gratitude journal, and I thank God for you often. 
And thank you to all of those out there practicing too. Knowing we're in this together, even though we don't know each other, is incredible. <3 I know I'm not practicing alone when I step onto my mat.

But I do appreciate all the continuous empowerment you choose to give us all through your words of affirmations. So many times during the session I‚Äôm ready to pull out of a move because it‚Äôs not comfortable. It‚Äôs hard to hold it or hard to flow through. But sloppy form or not, I stay in the shape. And when I‚Äôm about to bail you always say something to get me through. I‚Äôm really hoping that my sloppy uneducated form becomes stronger and more aligned before or at least by the 30 days.

1084.0,"I am experiencing a return of the rather limiting brain fatigue I have been batteling since having had covid-19, very seriously ill for 4 weeks, in the autumn of 2020. 

I lost both my parents and 4 other close relatives plus one of my closest childhood friends during 14 months. It is starting to take its toll now...  The grief, the practical work, going through things and maintaining a regular day-to-day routine has been so very demanding!! Now even writing an email is too much and takes forever! Trying not to worry and have faith in that my brain will recover once more üôè The yoga breathing (ogjai, spelling?) helps a lot...  

I usually do yoga morning & evening. Keeps me out of my wheelchair (I'm injured in my back & neck since almost 3 decades) and maintains my body strong and mobile. However, during this year ""horribilis"" I've lost the good routine... Only do yoga once a day, sometimes even skipping that! 

Now, I am so content to have started again, my sixth 30 days challenge w/Adriene, what a way to start a new year... 

And I'm so happy to realize I have not lost all my strength and mobility üòä It just needs freshening up üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1147.0,"Deepening the practice is very interesting for me to think about and it adds so much to the practice to play around with terms such as this one.¬†
Of course you can simply move from one pose to another and just get it over with. But it can be so much more. Really bringing your attention to the how - how you move matters :)¬†
It could mean being aware of the transitions between the poses. Could be inviting a nice audible breath in sukhasana or a full belly breath in some twists. Maybe it's making an intention in the beginning of the practice that you can repeat during it - bringing a meaning to the movement.
I started practicing when I was quite young. As an 8 year old,  with English as my second language, I did it simply as an excercise. It took years to really start noticing other aspects of it.¬†
So whether you're just starting practicing or you've done it for many years - if you haven't yet, you will find what deepening your practice is for you. If you already have your translation of it - keep exploring, stay curious.",UgxQilFR6n2lLoVR3hZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-06T20:23:20Z,0.9923804998397827

Watching you try and shush Benji and then just keep on practicing was perfect. My own furry pal will give a few ""woofs"" or grumbles at the window while I'm practicing and I always take it as an opportunity to embrace the beautiful, imperfectly perfect moment I'm in. Just like you did here. :)

I'm 36, and I've had a tough road with my body and my sense of self-worth. I've been practicing on and off with you for 3-4 years, but finally got serious with your 30 day Breathe series last January. It was so transformative for me, and I practiced with you almost every day in 2021, following both your calendars or whatever I needed that day. 

After a year of solid practice, I can sincerely say that I love and accept myself and my body. And that every day is a chance to be the best version of myself that I can be. There are still ways I want to improve and grow, but that fundamental self-care and self-respect underpin those desires for growth instead of the self-loathing and shame that used to. 

I'm so grateful to you for the tools you've given me to cultivate a healthy relationship with myself because that foundation of true self-love has made me capable of remarkable changes in my personal life.

1434.0,"Yesterday with flow was amazing!! It really caused me to connect with and consider all aspects of my physical body and presence in each pose and movement. So today, I felt that deepening my practice would be to become aware of and consider my emotional and mental energy as I breathed and moved. Mantras I added in my mind throughout today's practice included: I love you. I am open. You are doing well. Let go. I trust.
It was quite incredible to follow what my spirit yearned for, as guided by the breath, and to speak them clearly in my mind. Beginning with ""I love you"" was incredible, and made me realize that my spirit was feeling low today. I was able to bring to light the things that I am stressed about, and then face them head-on emotionally. My instinct was to avoid and cling to the idea that it will work out the way I want it to. Today I was able to give myself a figurative hug, embrace myself with love, and begin to accept what I cannot control. Thank you!

1506.0,"During practice today, I discovered places to deepen, especially in the forward folds with hips rotated. 
I commented below in response to Adriene's queary ""what does it mean...?"" that deepening for me means noticing where I can go deeper and allowing that to happen- right there at the ""ends"" of my range of motion, range of breath, I actually find there is more space, infinite space, to explore. Side note: last year I did the 30 day journey and was simultaneously doing ""dry January"". On the last day of the practice, as usual, I cried, but this time I really cried! Tears of joy and so much gratitude for giving myself the gift of alcohol-free living as well as the yoga. I am thrilled to say I begin this year's yoga journey still alcohol-free, having passed my 1 year no alcohol anniversary on Jan 1 2022. If you are sober-curious or you want to change your relationship with alcohol, I can tell you from experience it is sooooooo worth it.

As someone with ADHD, it's hard for me to keep going when I don't feel 100% pumped to do something.

I started YWA in mid 2020, and I've been practicing on and off since then.

1543.0,"If you're finding that your wrists are feeling a little pain, you can use your knuckles instead which stack your wrist providing more support. And slow you can build flexibility and strength in your wrists with more practice using them. 

If you are just dealing with stiffness in the body, or soreness in the muscles, you can breath through it and take awareness to only the breath and the body letting the mind complain all it wishes. As long as you are not experiencing sharp pains. You will know when your body can keep going and when it's just the mind complaining. 

Be gentle with yourself easing into these Asanas. You don't have to overextend yourself to the point of pain.",UgxnvfpquPeyKspAW_x4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-01-06T14:38:07Z,0.826941192150116

When it comes to breath - should I breathe into my stomach where my belly expands? or into the chest? Because in some postures Adriene speaks about breathing into the belly but I am unsure if she means literally or as imagery to help people not move their shoulders as much.

ALSO - ""relax your shoulder"". My natural posture is slouched when relaxed. Or does she mean push the shoulders down and back?",Ugx6l1IdhpqQQXUvCOh4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2022-01-06T10:35:47Z,-0.9977630376815796

Still a wonderful practice but I just wanted to let others know in case you‚Äôre like me and don‚Äôt prefer to stretch deeply on a cold body.,Ugxo-MfA3DKW_nYr3SZ4AaABAg,1.0,4.0,2022-01-06T09:36:31Z,-0.9441357851028442
1890.0,"I‚Äôm loving this new daily routine! I used to practice almost every day, but I picked the video‚Äôs myself. So when I did a more ‚Äúheavy‚Äù one, the next day I‚Äôd do something lighter, more focused on the breath for example. So I‚Äôm noticing a little resistance in that I do feel muscle aches and tend to think I need a lighter ‚Äúbreak‚Äù in between. I may be overthinking this, but is it okay to power through?",Ugykmo-s1QYdYv6-FaZ4AaABAg,7.0,16.0,2022-01-06T09:31:44Z,0.7289371490478516
