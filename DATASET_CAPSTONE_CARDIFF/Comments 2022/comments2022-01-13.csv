I pushed myself and did the whole 20 minutes even though I was angry at myself.

It finally came down to surgery and the week I was to set the surgery date, I found out I was pregnant. My little bud pushed me to heal and I was able to do yoga again without surgery. My baby saved me from surgery and your videos helped me get through to heal. I began this year doing Move. We were due to find out our baby's gender this past Tuesday but what they found was our little bud no longer had a heartbeat. I am still in the process of miscarriage and I haven't been able to find much comfort. I decided to try to get back in on Move. This practice moved my heart so.

I stayed with it, and I’ll be back tomorrow too. Giving up on my body and my future is not an option. I know I’m worthy and someday soon, I’ll take off and start my life for real.

608.0,"Move really feels much more challenging than Breath, or other monthly YWA calendars. Last year I began practicing with YWA in January and kept with it every day through April, then started to mix up YWA with other fitness and yoga activities. For all of 2021, I regularly practiced yoga at home several days a week. I am finding Move to be tough going, especially this week. It's discouraging to not be able to get my knees in my armpits at all, or quickly move in and out of the balancing poses, or do all the mountain climbers, etc. Obviously, a lot of this is on me, because only I can let go of my perfectionism. But I am grateful that I am not coming to a regular home practice for the first time this year, because I might have thought it wasn't for people like me (i.e., older, heavier, less flexible, with less strength). I know I made a lot of progress last year in my flexibility and strength so I am going to stick with it. This comment is really here for newbies who might be feeling bad that they can't do all of this. You're not imagining it. This is hard.

And when you Adriene, said in the end, that this was just today, tomorrow will be different, I felt soooo relieved!

That was amazing. I am impressed how curious and playful I was rather than being discouraged or demotivated.
