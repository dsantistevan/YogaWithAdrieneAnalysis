15.0,"I am very late in doing this, but I keep coming back to the challenge even if I miss a couple of days. Today when Adriene said “we’re learning to fly but we also have to learn to fall, that’s part of the deal” that made me so emotional. If only we’re taught that as children or as we’re growing up! I’ll definitely be passing that lesson down to my kids.",UgxHQWCMPC0ZHJ85JTx4AaABAg,0.0,3.0,2022-02-19T03:29:17Z,0.9913731217384338
16.0,"I was already late to the party, but I wasn't too concerned about when I was showing up. Then I just... fell off. I'd gotten into a great routine of waking early (I'm a morning person at heart), doing practice, then cycling for a bit to get myself into a great headspace for the day. And then I stopped. I haven't done yoga in about 6 days. I won't lie, it was the Flight video that almost pushed me to not come back. I would lie in bed at 5am thinking ""no, I don't want to today"". And I recognised that there was nothing wrong physically, it was just my mind rebelling against what is good for me, sinking back in to those habits of staying in bed where it's safe and warm even though it leaves me groggy and cranky. 

So today, when I woke up naturally at 5:30 instead of being startled by an alarm, I asked myself ""why don't you want to do yoga?"" And I realised that anxiety masquerades as many different things. I was anxious about being able to do it. So I didn't fight myself, I just skipped that practice. The old me would be furious with myself - ""you can't just skip something that you're scared of!"". Sure, but you also don't have to force yourself to do something just for completions sake. I struggled today, my wrists and shoulders are aching even though I tried to engage my hands more like Adrienne suggested. But I'm definitely getting stronger! I managed to go down from plank to my belly without collapsing down, and also managed to push myself up again without caving my low back. 

Adrienne, your greeting of being glad to see me return even though it's hard was so perfectly timed. You just know what's going on. Thank you for being my guiding light and part of the best routine I've ever had. I'm so pleased to be on this journey and you are teaching me that patience outweighs perfectionism every time.",UgyNOAFS7atyg_xD7B54AaABAg,0.0,3.0,2022-02-18T07:46:55Z,0.9801441431045532

Recently I had meniscus repair surgery on my right knee as well as a clean up of both my knees due to arthritis.  My left knee is doing well, but my right one is struggling...I've lost more cartilage in that knee than in the left.  I'm wondering if there is an alternate asana I could do instead of squats.  They are very difficult for me and the pressure on my knees causes pain.  Today I merely sat and watched that sequence.  I have difficulty with child's pose as well so I've been going into dolphin for that.

221.0,"I started this journey on the third of January instead of the second, and it's amazing how every practice was exactly what I needed that specific day. Like it was meant to be. Today, after working on my deadlines non stop and postponing the practice, I decided to hop onto the mat 22 minutes to midnight. The word ''rest'' instantly popped into my mind when “What do you want to move closer to?” was asked. Your practices remind me to take better care of myself. They replace my negative thoughts about myself with happy and loving ones. I am so so so thankful for Adriene, for this journey and this beautiful community.

(I just realized writing this it's actually been three years - the beginning of 2019 was three years ago, not two - aaaaaaaahhhh!)

I also love how these practices ebb and flow, with some being intense and some asking us to find real stillness.

It's so, so true.  The only person I ever need to compare myself with is who I was yesterday.  No one else out there is my competition.  Instead we need to lift others up.

453.0,"This practice got me thinking about the difference between ""I want to move closer to this"" and ""I want to achieve this."" There is such an emphasis on achievement in our society these days, such that many things are considered meaningless if they don't have an end goal. But I like the idea of simply...moving closer to something. Focusing on the step I can take right now. I may never reach complete health, or complete happiness, or complete serenity. But the practice of moving closer to those things has its own worth. And showing up for myself and the people around me in each individual moment has a greater impact than some far-off, unattainable goal.

Just some thoughts. Thank you for prompting this contemplation! I always think I've started these 30 day journeys simply for my physical health and always seem to forget how much mental work is involved too. :)",UgyQzD5OlynovYeZv0x4AaABAg,5.0,139.0,2022-01-15T20:53:21Z,0.995845377445221

I am supported by many many beautiful people. Some that I know, many that are strangers to me. Nothing changes overnight, but a little bit of support and faith goes a long long way for me. So when asked what I wanted to move towards, I reminded myself that receiving that love was the result of leaning into adversity, continuing to see a better life, and ASKING for help. So I want to continue to move towards that. The version of me that is open to recieve that goodness. Thanks all.

But here we are, 2 years in the future and I have grown closer to mediation and it has become an integral part of my daily routines, just as moving and flowing has as well. We love growth.

And not wanting to just lay down and take a nap on the mat. I was unhealthy physically, mentally and spiritually. I ended up taking months off from yoga or any exercise at all. But I picked it back up in the late summer/fall after going no contact with my VERY TOXIC mother. Adriennes calmness and benji’s sweetness...the whole aesthetic of the entire sessions are so pure and inviting. I’ve learned to enjoy the moment in the moment. I’ve learned to be thankful for the privilege to move my body and hear my breath. I’ve become thankful. In the thankfulness, I enjoy every second of my yoga sessions! I enjoy strengthening my body.

Personal win today: Usually, when we do knee to chin or knee to elbow, and then kick the foot up to the mat, I literally kick it up, kind of aggressively, so I can get it in one.

794.0,"I missed yesterday session because I took my third covid vaccine and got a fever 🤒 but I’m gonna do that today and hopefully todays session too if the fever 🥵 doesn’t come back. I was doing great with following the sessions every day but the shot made me a little sick 😷 and I don’t like that at all. Really wanted to do this and not miss a single day 😷, but I’m gonna try fix that today. Yoga 🧘 is good for you and especially the breathing part. Read that it has a good thing for the diaphragm if you have IBS. I don’t know if it is true but with my ballon belly I need to do this and to de- stress a bit.",UgwH7KlS1H2U0h4SNTB4AaABAg,1.0,4.0,2022-01-15T08:34:56Z,-0.7459611892700195
