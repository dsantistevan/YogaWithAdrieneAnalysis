26.0,Day 22 ✅ I enjoyed this practice very much especially doing the lion’s breath. I felt stronger and more confident of myself doing these poses. I find that my relationship towards my body has changed as well. I feel like this is the first time where I am actually working with it and as a result my mind gets calmer and my disposition happier. I notice the nature more consciously these days and breathe a little deeper too. Thanks Adriene and Benji!

166.0,"Since starting this yoga journey, some days have felt like an uphill battle, like I'm wading through treacle and struggling to centre myself in postures, particularly when trying to fit the sessions around a busy working schedule. Something finally shifted today, I felt a fluidity between poses, a connection between body & breath and a little more space open up in my back and legs...I actually really enjoyed this practice and wasn't just trying to get it done and start on the next task. Is this what 'being in the moment' feels like? 

So grateful to you Adriene for being such a generous, compassionate teacher & sharing your gifts with us. Also super grateful to be part of such a special yoga community. I've been practicing with Adriene yoga vids for nearly 10 years now, but very sporadically. First discovered you during my first episode of depression & anxiety in my early 20s, I have learned so much about the mind/body connection through just a little bit of yoga here & there and your gentle, yet determined & strong nature. Definitely starting to see the benefits of a daily yoga practice and thinking of aiming for 100 days of consistent practice now. 

Huge well done to everyone who keeps showing up to the mat, you're all heros ♡",UgwtxnJaVMB3eeQt5kN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-26T12:24:59Z,0.9991081357002258

Then I literally slo-mo  swam my arms back to  Mountain. It was great! I think the mixture of knocking on heaven's door, lion's breath, thunderous hops, and the overall permission/freedom to be silly worked some kind of magic on me today. Thank you!

424.0,"The title of today's practice is resonating with me far more than I imagined it would! 

I have to confess that, having previously done all of YWA's 30-day series a couple of times each, I've been feeling a bit resentful about how difficult this Move series is for me. It has felt faster and more high-energy than other series, which is very much outside of my comfort zone! Also, my familiarity with the previous series means I'm used to just being guided by Adriene's voice, but there are so many new moves in this one that I have to look at the screen more often than before. 

I suddenly realised today (on day 22 lol, that took a while!) that it's actually okay that I'm finding Move more challenging. It simply means this series is requiring more courage from me than the previous ones, and I think I might finally be willing to embrace that <3",UgwKzVS913Y6REWH2_94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-23T21:57:21Z,0.9949911236763

432.0,"sometimes i see people saying they cried during practice, but it never happened to me before. i went through a rough year working on my graduation project. i was frequently late with deadlines even though i did the best i could. it was psychologically very stressful, i even had physical symptoms arising from time to time, plus so many issues going on because of the pandemic and all. yoga was my safe place where i knew id always find support when my mind was apparently trying to kill me, i can always count on adrienes yoga. today i delivered the text - im late, spent, and still with that bitter taste that my best wasnt enough. this system does not consider subjectivities, does not consider people are people. its so easy to find yourself feeling worthless because you werent perfect. because you werent the ideal everyone wanted. since when was this system perfect and ideal? if even a system cant be perfect, what could be said about real people? i cried saying something kind to myself at the end. ""you did well. congratulations"". simple and small. yet so understanding. i feel i belong here. thank you so much, adriene... thanks everyone whos here practicing and giving themselves a chance... a place... its truly a miracle we can find such a kind space in this messed up world.",Ugxbghv5PbPkucPRvlB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-23T21:38:21Z,0.9937594532966614

​
Lord Jesus, I believe that You are the Son of God and the only way to God. You are the way, the truth and the life and no one comes to the Father except by You. You died on the cross for my sins and rose again from the dead.
 
You have redeemed, cleansed and sanctified me by Your blood. I belong to You and I want to live for You. I confess all my sins, I'm sorry for them all, even those I'm not aware of. I renounce them all and ask for Your forgiveness.
​
 I let go of all my unforgiveness and bitterness as I know I must do for God to forgive me. In particular, I forgive.....
 
Forgive me Lord, for any sins that have allowed a curse to come over my life and free me from the consequences of my ancestor's sins, whatever those sins may be.
 
I believe that on the cross You took on Yourself every curse that could ever come upon me. So I ask You now to release me from every curse over my life - in Your name, Lord Jesus Christ!
​
Lord, by your Holy Spirit reveal Your truth to me and break down the strongholds the enemy has built in my mind.
​
I give up all my rebellion, pride and all my sin and I humbly submit myself to You as my Lord. 
​
I reject and renounce all contact with anything occult or satanic, if I have any contact objects, I commit myself to destroy them. I cancel all Satan's claims against me. 
​
Lord Jesus, forgive me and cleanse me with your blood.  I thank You that by Your blood I am cleansed from all sin. You are my deliverer.  
 
You know why I have come before You today, You know what afflicts me - I stand on the promise of your word 'whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be delivered',  I call upon You now.  
 
In the name of Jesus Christ, deliver me and set me free.  I renounce the devil and all his works. I loose myself from him, in the name of Jesus and I command him to leave me right now, in Jesus' name.
 
Amen",Ugw9MpXWwt7QoQnga154AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-23T13:41:09Z,0.8980686664581299
