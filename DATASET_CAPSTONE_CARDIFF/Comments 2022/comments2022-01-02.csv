There is still ways to go, but it's not what matters. 2 years go, at the dawn of 2020, I decided two things. That I would become vegan and practice yoga everyday with Adriene. 20 kilos lost later, so much more presence and grounding, I can only be grateful to Adriene and my past self. Hang in there if it all seems difficult. There are so many poses I couldn't even hold for one second, I could barely finish the first sessions and now I find myself finding ease in some of the ones that were the most challenging. Take your time, find your peace and know that showing up is enough.

622.0,"Just practiced with 1 thousand of you üíü thank you for being here with me. I noticed two things today: the first is for just my practice, namely that I don't touch myself so easily and gently when stressed so often as I do when happy and that I should change that. The second I felt was profound for me: when Adrienne says breathe in love exhale love I never realized how much that pertains to beyond mantra and yogic practice til now. When you inhale you accept the air around you as a source of sustenance. We should do the same when accepting the nourishment and love of others. Do it knowing we do need others to survive and do it with trust and as much ease as exists in the moment. Additionally when I used to sigh it out i used to think of it only as letting go of the negative things within me but the truth is my audible expression - however it may appear on a given day (a heavy lion of a sigh or a simple breath out) - shifts things within my environment and has beautiful impacts on those I love. I should value my exhale and trust my inhales in each moment way more than I do, both in the physical sense and now in the spiritual one too. And I wouldnt even consider myself a very spiritual person til now lol",UgxSIGsv8Xh-fiN_3WV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-06T05:21:16Z,0.9980337023735046

1032.0,"Wow. Reading some of your comments has me realize what tough times people go through and how much yoga can help them through it. While maybe not as big as other peoples problems, today especially I have been struggling with loving myself. Like truly loving my soul and everything that I am, and am not. I have cried today. I have bit my tongue a lot today so as not to say the wrong thing, or in order to keep my peace. I have lived in fear and sadness today. Tomorrow may not be too different, but during yoga today when Adriene told us to whisper ""I love you"" to ourselves, I felt a little better - like I was seen, heard, and deserving of even a tiny bit of love. Loving yourself and your pure existence is not easy and may comes in waves. I hope for tomorrow to be happier, and everyday I work on changing my mindset towards loving my heart just a little more. I hope that all these tiny wins will result in me loving my heart and who I am so much, to the point where one day I can help someone get there too. Namaste and see you all tomorrow, and all the days after that, until day 30 (and past day 30, cause heck, yoga is awesome).

My mom wasn't with me today, so I did it by myself, which let me really notice my down-dog struggles-- the difference when the difficulty of holding the movement is something I can push through, and when it all comes to be too much. Turns out, it has a lot to do with when I lose control of my breath/start breathing hard from exertion. Having the breath cues really helps me, I'll be trying to focus more on staying in control and hopefully that will help me work through the difficult poses.

Of course, I couldn't appreciate it too much because my arms and legs were shaking themselves to pieces holding some of those poses! 

Though the hardest bit might be trying to find a way to keep glancing at the screen! I guess with experience, you start to learn some of the positions so you don't need to watch for guidance quite so much and you become stronger so you can focus more on the sensations.

To your dream, to understand
That this is an interim time
Full of awkward disconnection.

Gradually you will come to find
Your way to friends who will open
Doors into a new belonging.

Your heart will brighten
With new discovery,
Your presence will unclench
And find ease,
Letting your substance
And promise be seen.

Slowly, a new world will open for you.
The eyes of your heart, refined
By this desert time, will be free
To see and celebrate the new life
For which you sacrificed everything.

Something happened yesterday and today - I began to incorporate smiling into my practice. Even though I had done 45 days of yoga (almost) in a row, some movements were still challenging. Instead of getting frustrated with myself, I had noticed that I was smiling. How alive it is to feel when your body is trembling with growth? The narratives have changed in my head from frustrated with my current strength level to ""wow, I can't wait to see where I can grow from here.""

1646.0,"This month marks the first birthday of my virtually mediated home yoga practice and gee Adriene, I'm here to tell you about how it's healed me! As a young adult, I've learned that my body and mind have something we might call PTSD and anxiety. To me, this experience has meant that I've spent life locked inside my noisy mind and have been resentful of my body and her many discomforts (a sore neck, lower back pain, stiff joints, insomnia, eczema that cracks my knuckles open, etc.). Yoga's given me the tools and PERMISSION to listen to my body and respond as this all arises. On days when I allow time for three yoga sessions - one to wake my body up, a mid-day check-in to reactivate, and an evening wind-down - I move lighter and rest deeper. This routine has led me to do things I never dreamed I'd experience - hiking alone for thirty miles across a muddy swamp, biking up the sides of mountains,  loving and CRAVING exercise and sweat. But more than that, it's meant the world to me emotionally. Learning to sit still has meant learning to feel safe being in my own mind! And trusting that when I don't feel at home in my current experience, I will be able to return eventually, no matter how far away I feel. This freedom has given me the courage to start practicing vulnerability with others and openly loving my chosen family. I have yoga to thank for the depth of my relationships, for the love I've co-created in the kitchen and in the garden for the past year. For the ease I find as I clean our bathroom and tend our fire. For my newfound confidence on the dance floor. For the wild joy of playing in the ocean with a child who is also one of my best friends. For the affirmation I've felt in crying with and receiving words of advice from my elders. By giving me love for myself, yoga has given me love for my intertwinement with my fellow beings, human and otherwise. 
Two days ago, I left the home where I've lived with my chosen family, and in this transition I've doubted that this move is truly right for my future. But I'm learning that the pain I feel in leaving them is so intertwined with the love we've made together that they are now just one beautifully whole experience. So when I returned to my mat today, after living the past few days in growing confusion and disconnection from myself, I asked myself ""How did I get here?"" And I knew the answer is love. And this gives me the courage to keep listening and keep responding to my body with all the awareness and love I can muster. Thank you, thank you, thank you Adriene.",UgyIhVyJTcSCa9y9ju54AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2022-01-03T18:09:54Z,0.803107805282219

1794.0,"‚≠êÔ∏è *5 Powerful Ways To Become Your Best Self:*

1. Try new things.
You can‚Äôt let yourself become complacent. Surprise yourself by pushing yourself outside of your¬†comfort zone. Doing so will give your ingenuity and innovative side a boost. Plus, you will have discovered something new about yourself -- perhaps a hidden talent or an ability to learn something you didn‚Äôt think you were capable of.

2. Pursue your dreams.
Most people on their deathbeds say their biggest regret was not living their life to the fullest and actually pursuing their dreams‚Ä¶ Instead, most of them lived a life pursuing other peoples dreams (like their parents) and never end up being their own authentic self‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre on your deathbeds. Do it now.

3. Sustain your motivation.
We all have days when we wake up just not feeling it. Those days when our brains won‚Äôt get going - we‚Äôd rather do anything besides working. But despite being low on energy or inspiration, you have to find a way to keep moving forward. Remember, progress is incremental. You have to find ways to keep that fire in your belly; to keep nurturing that deep desire to achieve. 

4. Create good habits.
Habits shape our life. But remember when developing a¬†habit it takes time and repetition, and should be done slowly. Trying to change too many things at once will feel overwhelming and daunting. The goal is to make incremental changes to your lifestyle that eventually become a way of life. Remember that even small habits can have a powerful cumulative effect.

5. Focus on self-care.
Never spread yourself too thin. Many times we focus too much on filling other peoples cups that we forget to fill our own‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt forget, you can‚Äôt be the best for others if you can‚Äôt be the best for yourself.

If you‚Äôve read this far and resonate with this post‚Ä¶ Save it to remind yourself everyday and give it a thumbs up so others can see it and apply it as well!

1822.0,"I'm lying here in corpse pose thinking about your question, ""what does it feel like to be alive today in your body?"" and it made me think of a story. A couple of years ago I was doing yoga with a friend who I recently introduced to Adriene's videos. We were doing a series of standing poses that required us to lift our arms above our head and I noticed him looking at me weird. After the practice he asked me why I didn't raise my arms completely over my head. How strange, wasn't that what I was doing? Apparently not. After showing me what I looked like in a mirror, my arms were nowhere near vertical. Now, I always had shoulder and upper back issues, but I thought I was improving. It felt like I was improving. I could have sworn my arms were over my head, so I never bothered to take the time and look. That was a big ""aha"" moment for me. Sometimes what you feel isn't always real. I think I became so familiar with the routine that I was turning on autopilot and no longer listening to what my body was telling me, and this disconnect between my mind and my body was making it very difficult to feel alive in it. So that's my challenge for everyone today. Be open to approaching each pose from a new perspective. You'll be shocked how much you still have to learn, even from something as simple as shavasana. This is another lesson I like to carry off the mat. The biggest disservice we can do to ourselves is assume we know everything.",UgxXIywzWfUZdPex9K14AaABAg,1.0,103.0,2022-01-03T15:58:31Z,-0.9748551249504089

2008.0,"Adriene, you really have no idea how much you are helping me (and probably anyone here) mentally with your yoga sessions. In 2021, I had to take one of the hardest decisions in my life. I had to either reinvent the life I was living in Japan, or restart my old life back home. I decided to return to my country of origin, which ended up being the wrong choice since it's not the life I truly want for the long term. When I was still in Japan, I would somtimes feel that I'm 'on the right path', but would quickly lose that sight due to high self-doubt and a range of other complications. The final minutes of this session somehow brought my thoughts to the origins of my fascination for Japanese language and culture, and it ignited a little fire in me. But when I heard the words ""you're on your path"", I just burst out in tears. Thank you so much for giving us the strength to believe in our goals, our purpose, our path.

Life nowadays is so fast paced but then, all of a sudden slows down and it‚Äôs so hard to know what to leave and what to do next.

2338.0,"Feeling really sore from yesterday, which just shows how much I need this. Yesterday really kicked my butt for some reason. 
I've been with Adriene since December 2014, was here for the very first 30 Days. And for a while I was really active with it. I know I got to 200 days of daily yoga at some point, enjoyed my time in the kula on Facebook. I got to go to a live class in Amsterdam, where I got to meet some of my fellow Kula members. I even got to meet Adriene quickly when she hopped into a picture we were taking. It was amazing and kind of nerve racking at the same time.
Years ago I fell off the mat. It's still always there and I very occasionally hop on it. I enjoy that time to the fullest, wondering why I'm not there more often. But then that feeling fades away. I've started all the 30 Days in the past few years, but never finished them.
I really want to start up a regular practice again. I know how good I can feel in my body when I do.
Adriene is right, though. Showing up really is the hardest part. üíú",Ugz0tY7Y0D0SNkljzD94AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-01-03T08:46:21Z,0.9908876419067383
