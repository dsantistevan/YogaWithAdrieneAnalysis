I don't care for sports and don't need to lose weight with intense workouts. The past few months I've been working on doing yoga consistently, and this year is the most I've exercised regularly, missing a few days per week. I was only doing beginners' yoga videos for a while, but now I feel strong enough to do the monthly yoga challenges even if some of the poses are hard to get through. This is the first one I'm doing. I'm proud of myself even though I still struggle with sleeping too much and not being able to concentrate on things I need to get done.

47.0,"I can‚Äôt overstate how helpful this video was to my mental well-being. I‚Äôve attempted a couple of 30 day courses before but always fell off for one reason or another. I decided this time I was going to stick to it no matter what, even if I took a day or two off I‚Äôd come back it. During this particular video, while doing the breathing exercise I had this moment where I thought to myself ‚Äúis this helpful for me? Maybe I should just stretch instead..‚Äù but I continued with the breathing and transitioned into the meditation. As we were going into the lying down portion it dawned on me that even though I felt like I wanted to do something else while we were doing the breathing exercises, it was preparing me to put my mind and body at rest to meditate. That thought process transitioned into several thoughts after the practice that made some profound revelations about what I‚Äôm doing professionally and personally in my life and that even though I may not enjoy exactly what is happening right now, I should embrace it as I‚Äôm being prepared for what‚Äôs next. I‚Äôve never felt more connected with myself or to my yoga practice than I have after this video. Your affirmations and warmness are so appreciated.

I'm not sure where all these emotions came from, and it's amazing how they can come through when meditating. Although I'm still feeling a bit of sadness, I do feel some reassurance that with my ever-changing life, comes new memories and new adventures to embark on.

Everyday I push myself and push myself, always thinking ahead on what I'm doing next in life, how I'm going to do it, why I'm going to do it, how it'll affect my loved ones around me, etc. I never realized how loud my thoughts can be because I never experienced a different volume. Through your videos you have helped me learn to clear my mind and silence the noise; take some time for myself to just appreciate being here, being present, and being me. Sometimes the clarity gets so overwhelming that I find silent tears falling down my cheeks. Today, was one of those days. I hope you know the positive effect you have on all those you share this journey with. Thank you so much for spreading your light.

240.0,"Here's my day eight check-in... I think I've forgotten to comment the past few days, but I'm glad to still be here to take part with Move. Today was a harder day for me, because I struggle with being still and able to hear my own thoughts. I had a harder time staying present because of these negative thought spirals I always find myself stuck in. I don't know why I'm so critical of myself, it just feels like something that can't be helped... But I'm sick of staying where I am out of futility. I'm going to learn to value my own opinion this year, my own feelings, my personality - I don't want to have to be told who I am by others anymore. I need to become someone strong and self-sustaining. I don't want to get knocked down every time someone hurts me. I don't want to spend my time waiting around for someone else's validation before I can start living. I need to live for myself. I know in my heart that I'm a good person, and I should be able trust my decisions without needing approval for them. I don't want to waste any more days waiting on the words of someone who is incapable of caring about me.

250.0,I enjoyed and struggled some with this practice. I have Tourette‚Äôs syndrome which causes mostly motor tics in my shoulders neck and legs. I‚Äôve always struggled with stillness. When the doctor says hold still I find it to hard and notice all the tic sensations in my body with it usually increasing as I hold still. This happened to me in a way today as we laid on our backs and tried to soften however I let myself soften and let the tics that came happen rather than tightening to hold them back. I realized I must spend an enormous amount of time surpassing by holding and tightening through the day. This was such an eye opener for me to see my softness might look different and towards the end the tics were less intense and fewer. I never thought to use yoga for my Tourette‚Äôs but will now. Meditation is also so hard as I have adhd and thought tics (intrusive repetitive thoughts). Today I finally feel like I could do these types of practice and not be doing it ‚Äòwrong‚Äô because I tic. I feel like I‚Äôm holding my tics back less today although they are happening more. Perhaps this is the direction I need. 10 years of holding things in can wear one down.,Ugwllha56_1qqx74kqx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-18T15:38:02Z,-0.8750864863395691

Hi. I saw you on the Today Show when the pandemic started, almost two years now. I wish you were my daughter-in-law, but daily yoga sessions are 2nd best.

""give yourself a hug when you needed one.

your soul is there for your body as your body is there for your soul.

we can always seek within for support.

we can always depend on and return to our breathing.""

398.0,"Every year I look forward to rest day, it's one of my favorite practices. But today when I woke up I got some really bad news and I was just feeling so anxious and irritable. I tried to keep calm during the practice, but it wasn't until we laid down and Adriene said ""let the mental chatter rest"" that I could actually let go and just be in my body and let my mind stop fixating on trying to escape my feelings. I was appreciating it so much that it was quite difficult to move to the fetal position, but eventually I moved there too because I really like practicing together with the community and being united in our actions, and I realized that I was just adding to my struggles because by trying to escape my painful emotions I was ignoring my inner child. And moving to the fetal position reminded me that I have a vulnerable side that was really hurt by being ignored by me. So I took some time to just listen to that part of me. What a good practice.

579.0,"I jumped one day - I live in Europe and on Thursday it was to late in the day to practice yoga, so I used day 1, one more time, so I'm at day 9 like all others, but just following the day before.

Yesterdays practice (official day 7s video nourish) I got so frustrated! 
Had to stop the video 4 times and recenter.
My breath wasn't synced at all - and the verbal commands was just as you did the movement Adriene, not before you did them. This made my movements a hole movement after yours and my anger just keeped growing, I couldn't stop it.
I'm not trying to yell at anyone - especially not at our lovely instructor.
The reason I couldn't control my self, is because I'm dealing with a lot (one of the things is post concussion syndrome, and a really sad and hard fact is that my brain gets tired) and it just wouldn't behave yesterday.
My wish for further verbal commands, is for them to get said before we are suppose to do them.

Anyway - lots of love to all doing the challenge and to Adriene!

586.0,"I went to bed yesterday immediately after this, so comment the next day instead! My kitty is a very anxious girl, has to be by my side if I'm home and of course this also extends to yoga.  Her faith in my ability to hold a plank is misguided. This was her favorite day yet, because not moving around too much let her sit right on my lap or stomach. Last year, I was so excited to do the 30 days challenge after discovering yoga earlier that year. Unfortunately, my life had other plans, and my previous cat ended up needing to be put down on 1/9/21. Her liver ended up failing and I had a very tense last few days with her combined with work stress - I ended up completing my 30 days something like 60. This slow day felt like a moment to pause and remember her and honor where I am now. My current kitty getting to sit on top of me felt like a little bonus, onward to new loves while keeping the memories of old ones close by.

859.0,"It's amazing how your videos are synced with my mood. Lately I've been feeling very anxious. I really needed some rest and even got emotional during this lovely practice. Sometimes I get stuck in these negative and ""scary"" thought patterns but I try to convince myself that it's ok to feel this way, I don't have to pretend like everything is alright and brush it off. If there's something I've learned from ywa it's that i get to move in my own pace, and fwfg for me, in this moment. Yes this feels like sh*t right now,  however better times will come. Growth and improvement isn't linear after all. 

I have come so far in my journey and I will keep moving forward. And as you mention, with the tools of yoga a little goes a long way . In the end I know that these thoughts come from insecurities, and lets face it: they are just thoughts, not facts. Sending love to anyone who is going through tough times.

860.0,I was throughly relaxed at the end of this practice. I had a moment at the end where some bad memories surfaced as I was lying on the pillow in fetal position but I was able to let them go. Usually if memories like that surfaced in any other situation it would of triggered my anxiety. But I was so at peace after this practice and a whole week of practice that I wasn't bothered by them. I just acknowledged them reminded myself they were from the past and couldn't be changed and chose to focus on the present moment. Thank You Adriene.

866.0,"Day 8. Very gentle practice and my body was grateful. Today I noticed how much space my body takes up. Yes, I know I am plus sized, but I mean the physical space my body takes up is not something I usually pay attention to and today‚Äôs practice brought that awareness. Crossing my legs was not difficult, but keeping them crossing without holding them was and so was threading the needle. The fetal position was nonexistent because my thighs, belly and chest made that a no-go, but the stillness was there. The rest that we were meant to take today was my main focus and at that, I excelled.  I made sure to focus on what I was good at today and clearing my mind, body awareness and relaxing‚Ä¶ those were pretty on point. I really enjoyed this practice and am actually happy that I waited until right before bed to do this one. Thank you for this guided meditation‚Ä¶.

998.0,"I had an incredible moment while laying down in shavasana. It is hard to describe and I am still trying to process it but I felt like I need to share it down here in the comments, maybe it will mean something to one of you. Maybe it'll be meaningful for me only, but it is still enough reasons for me to share it. I do have a habit of meditation and I believe I have improved my skills of experiencing the moment and staying there while meditating over the years. But today I felt, actually _lived_ something I never have before. While allowing myself to relax with Adriane's guide I came to realize I only exist in this moment. For that second absolutely noting mattered. There was no future and no past, just the moment. I did't even think about being in the moment. Just nothing went through my mind. A complete nothingness. All though it might sound scary it was actually very pleasant to be in that state. It was a like a moment of dissociation, but not in a bad way. More like a climax maybe. It felt like I achieved the consciousness of the nothingness. Like I said it is really hard to describe in words because  I wasn't really _I_, I was just _there_ without being anything. As I allowed myself to be in this situation this tingling sensation ran over my scalp down to my spine, so strong I felt my body shake for a bit. And just at the exact same time, simultaneously with that shake, the items in my room (I have some paint bottles and some glass bottles standing on my bookshelf) next to where I was lying down made a sound. As if there was a tiny earthquake and they hit each other briefly. That sound kinda brought me back to myself because I had an immediate fear response. I almost opened my eyes to check what was going on with the bottles but I resisted the tendency to do so. I just took a deep breath and allowed myself to let that fear go. I am a strong defender of empirical science so I tend to be skeptical about ""scientifically hard to explain"" spiritual events. But experiencing this on the first hand, I do believe that  there are mystical things about us and this world that are yet beyond our comprehension. Does feel odd for me to write this down but I kinda believe that what moved those bottles was the tingling response in my body. That sensation was maybe like a wave started in my body but didn't stop there, instead it kept on going beyond my physical body and affected the items in the room. It may have gone further even, but I don't know. I even think it may not have started in _my body_ but in someone else's and it reached to me. That is why I wanted to write this down here. Because right now I feel deeply connected to you, some people I probably will never get to see, hear, touch, know. But I may have just received your sensation. And I want to thank you for sharing it with me.",UgzhAo9a4EcaxqE3XO94AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-01-09T21:03:47Z,0.4320249652214023

And then came today's practice. I don't know how you do it, but it's always what I need. Toward the end, when you said to let go, tears fell from my eyes. I had an internal mantra of, ""It's okay to rest."" And that was profound for me today. I hope I can carry this with me through the day and through the week.

I struggled today with this practice because at times I had to confront how alone I often feel and with no clear direction as to what direction I next want to take in the area of my career, as well as other areas of my life. Wrapping myself in my blanket, I felt safe and comforted. I will come back for a second time to this practice later today. But I am so grateful that I am saying yes to this practice. And the next step for me to take today in this practice is to pray, to acknowledge that in fact I am safe, that I am secure, and the Universe and Spirit has my back and always has.

1290.0,"I used to think that grabbing a blanket, or a pillow, or putting on a pair of fuzzy socks, was a waste of my time. ""Why?"" I thought to myself.. ""It's not like those things are going to make THAT much difference."" Well, an adrenal fatigue, burnout, and an episode of exhaustion-related psychosis later, let me tell you this much: those things make ALL the difference. Slowing down, and tending to ourselves in that way, teaches us our self-worth, it rekindles us with our True Self. It is a matter of beautifying all the in-betweens, and taking the time to make every moment, every breath: SPECIAL. It is self-Love, it is self-Care, it is self-Respect. Taking the time to do those little things, transfers into my daily life, and it teaches me healthier boundaries, better relationship with my body and my feminine cycles. Please, if you are new here, DO take that time to give yourself all the ""extras,"" for your life outside of the mat, will be that much more rewarding.",Ugx4HXYthSuXbgATDst4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-09T16:10:04Z,0.9779112935066223
