112.0,"I really wasn't feeling the connection with myself today and was struggling getting into the session, my mind was on everything else and my breathing was out of sync, I got tired after doing the poses for a few seconds and I just wanted to quit it and go lie in my bed. My thoughts were a mess, until we were doing the tree pose and Adriene talked about how it's a beautiful part of the proces to fall, to get out of the habit of wanting to nail it and to be curious of the falling. I could instantly feel my mind and my breathing calm and I was able to fully enjoy the last few minutes with no disturbances.¬†

Personally, it was eye opening being told that we don't have to fear falling or not getting it completely right. Failing isn't something to be feared but a part of the proces in everything we do, it's how we learn and we can feel curious about this instead of fearing it. It's crazy how applicable these words are for so many aspects of our lives outside of yoga. There's something in my life I've put off doing for a long time now, but I want to be able to explore it with curiosity instead going forward.

..While yoga is still not part of my regular schedule yet (I only do it when I feel sick, which is like unfortunately every day) I am hoping such traits don't bother with me getting into more depth into these sorts of activities.

412.0,"Tree pose is the pose of forgiveness. It's the pose where you allow yourself to lose your balance and lovingly say to yourself, ""it's okay. You're on the path. And sometime you're going to fall on the path. But the goal is to get back up."" And so that's what I did. I got back up and remembered to turn to the mirror for balance and the helping support of a chair or the wall. Today's practice reminded me of the old adage about how to get to Carnegie Hall. I hope that everyone had a beautiful practice today and that you took time out of your day to acknowledge that you've made it to Day 9 of this 30 day challenge.

How powerful is it that we are working together in this way?  It's so easy to look at the world and see all the division, all the fear.  So easy to look at our neighbors and our partners and see them for what they don't provide us, what they can't be.

Heels not touching the ground in downward dog? It's because I was focused on pushing my heels down, rather than lifting my hips up. Don't just keep doing things the same way, because that's how you've always done them. Sometimes even a small change in your behavior can have drastic and long lasting results. Change requires curiosity.  So if you find yourself struggling with a pose today, take a step back and try approaching it differently.

I am really struggling with my mental health right now. But I wanted to take this opportunity to engage with yoga, since it does interest me, but I have a habit of now exploring the things that interest me, I don't let it grow because of some kind of fear. I've been doing this my whole life, which is very painful to face. And even doing yoga right now is difficult, since my brain is panicking a little bit, but today during the treepose I closed my eyes and fell and it felt right. If anyone is also struggling, please know, that your experience is valid and that you're not alone. Please do ask for help if you need it. You are worth it <3

First, I got my vaccine booster and then my period both leading to exhaustion. The Rest practice was perfect to still do the yoga challenge but today I tried to get back on track. My body‚Äôs weaker than on Day 1 and poses I can usually do with ease were very challenging. Nevertheless I‚Äôm glad I came to the mat. Thank you Adriene for guiding us and helping me to regain my strength, it‚Äôs very much appreciated. And thank you to everyone else practicing and commenting about their experiences. Especially today. It was a big motivation for me to appear on the mat in the first place. Greetings from Germany into the world.
