32.0,Jan 2020 I had to stop yoga due to what became a frozen shoulder. I went 2 yrs without yoga- been doing some sort of yoga since 1978 so that was huge!!!  The 1st 3 days were dreadful and upsetting to think how I struggled with even the simplest move. By the 4th straight day I felt great but shoulder was off!  I learned 3 days in a row with 1 day off works for me and not to push it.

When you have more time - a weekend or holiday, pick and choose from the 30 day series.  You definitely don't need to do it in order or every day but do try 15 minutes.

I think this was one of my favorite practices of this series and the Home series that i completed last month. i used to practice OFTEN in person but stopped 3 years ago when i had hand surgery I tried a few versions of home yoga but couldn't find a groove and was about ready to find a new studio (I moved towns) when March of 2020 happened. I just haven't felt comfortable going back to that environment. i started working with a nutritionist/trainer in October to lose some menopause pounds and she turned me on to Adriene and i'm so glad - she spoke to my heart immediately. i've enjoyed just as much, the community that she has inspired and fosters. Humble Warrior felt amazing today and i was smiling the whole time. Best of all was feeling the strength I have regained. I will have to tag this session to come back to for sheer fun.

340.0,"Adriene… this is the episode that I learned how to breathe again with. I’m a bit behind. Day 10 was last night. I’ve been chest breathing since being pregnant with my second. He’s 8 months old. I’ve had crippling postpartum anxiety since mid-June. I haven’t been present. Sometime during last night’s practice I learned how to belly breathe again. During the last pose, it felt dizzying as I faded into presence and back to dissociation. I felt my breath trying to ground me and make everything exist. Last night, after this uplifting practice, I had to sit on the couch and belly breathe. I nursed my baby and cuddled with our black lab blue heeler mix. During the 10 days of yoga (I had to take 1 day off in between), I have found the strength to stop taking an asthma steroid (it’s been 84 hours without now!) I have found the strength to cut gluten out of my diet and change my diet. I found the resiliency to take my sons for a mile long story walk even though it was scary and for the beginning of it I felt like nothing was real. I was able to ground myself and be present. All of this because you have helped me become more present in my body. Somewhere between day 7 and 8 of yoga, I felt enough strength to make these changes I couldn’t make before.

490.0,"This day will always stay reminiscent for me when I look back to it in the coming future.
Today, I nearly skipped the practice. At night, when I was on the verge of dozing off to my dreamland - my heart recalled my mat. I felt a little guilt rushing inside me for being forgetful about my commitment towards myself.
I was in a dilemma whether to sleep off, or show up. 
I recollected Adriene mam's words from one of the practices - showing up to the mat is a great way to say, I Love You. 
Her words echoed inside my mind, "" You are committed, you have to show up, no.matter.what.""
And so I did.
Without caring of the timing or the sleepy environment, I showed up, at 11PM.
After the practice, when here I am uplifted from the heart - I caressed the mat and softly gazed at it, pondering over how dedicated I am, of how strong the bond of love I have with myself is. As you said Adriene, I showed up - no.matter.what. And I am intrigued over the how much I love myself.
I am proud of myself.
I am proud to have showed up.
Now is when I have finally realized - the hardest part, indeed, is showing up.
This incident is a reminder to myself and to everyone reading - that you are dedicated - and you will show up.
Stay committed to yourself, because you certainly deserve the love.
Namaste.",UgyUY6B8wsGUeJwC61J4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-12T18:32:45Z,0.9989218711853027

I was determined to be disciplined and do the Move practice with the intention to finish it. Thus far, i absolutely love it. Is it challenging? Of course, but worth every minutes of it.

I’ve been seeing improvement with moving them downward, but when I try to move my arms away from the body it feels like I am straining, so I back off.

773.0,"Thanks, Adriene (and Benji)! Some thoughts from me today:

1. I was ready for today's session. I've had a long day of not moving very much (less than usual, even). Today was probably the first day when I was eagerly anticipating the yoga for itself rather than just for the satisfaction of getting another day in the sequence, if that makes sense. I'm pleased to say it met my expectations and I found it thoroughly uplifting!
2. Ten days ago, I'd never ever done a ""downward facing dog"", but today it feels like returning home. As soon as you name it, I know where I am. It's a known, familiar place to be.
3. I creak like an old wardrobe in some of those poses. Which probably tells you how inflexible I am and how little I move around during the rest of my day!
4. By the end of that, when I was on my back, my arms and hands were perfectly relaxed. I could have moved them, but they were just so relaxed that I didn't want to disturb them. So I have to admit I didn't join you in that final seat until a little late.",Ugw5YJ8mcZx_B8HM2I14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-11T23:32:06Z,0.9973503351211548

BUT, I always come back to your videos when I feel like I need a little yoga medicine. Thanks to sticking with your practices diligently (in the early years) I hear your commentary when I practice and instinctively understand to adjust myself accordingly and check all my posture points.

Something I was grateful for during this practice was the realization that for years I’ve now been practicing with my eyes closed for the majority of each practice. This is thanks to the UPLIFTING joy these videos bring to me so that I have learned to trust my body more than ever before.

884.0,"Y'all I don't want to shift the focus from the great video and practice but I want to share something with you, as I see in the comments a lot of folks are dealing with a hard time. Sometimes I like to think like that what seems like this bad luck that is following us is just one small step away from getting things finally work. Some small, even random step, like the butterfly effect kind of way. Like a hidden small quest from the destiny that even makes no sense. Like, I'll finally land my dream job once I set foot at the coffee shop in my building (like, I've been living here for ages but never ever visited). Or I'll finally find true love once I finally wear that dress I bought years ago but always told my self, I'll wear it some other time. The thing is, stuff might be hard sometimes but you might need just a little push, so things start getting good again! and guess what, since you are here on this yoga journey, you are already on the right path. Just remember, have courage, have faith, work hard and be a good and loving person.

I finished today's practice but definitely with a lot of moderations and breaks. But at the end of the session I had an emotional meltdown. I cried because I couldn't do the moves properly and felt like a failure. I felt miserable about my body and how out of shape I  truly am. I felt disheartened that I may never have a fit body. All these thoughts made me cry. I also reminisced the times when I was fat-shamed. I was an emotional mess today. 

But then I reminded myself that how easily I can do downard dog pose now compared to Day 1 and that's a huge achievement. And I consoled myself that one day, with practice I will be able to do the moves properly.

Today's session taught me a lot of things. Today's session taught me that even a fat girl like me can do yoga. So, thank you Adriene from the bottom of my heart ❤️",UgwAPbHcw8HEepo0pfd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-11T15:50:04Z,-0.9540852904319763

So for me I’m not able to do days 9-11 but I told myself I will just play the video and do the breathing portions only not to loose my commitment to myself.

I noticed just how much YWA has made me aware of how I move... how badly I have moved & these last 10 days have really forced me to notice that and to consciously, with intent, change how I balance myself.

I found my legs shaking and sweat dripping into my glasses (though the strap I bought is keeping my glasses on my face!). As I tried to mimic the graceful moves that Adriene showed us, I took solace in knowing that I am at a different part of the journey than her. I did my best and I can start to feel the upper body strength increasing when I do my downward facing dogs. Baby steps. But they're steps nonetheless. Wishing everyone a good practice today! P.S.

1208.0,"Subtle Adriene! Sneaking in a backbend class without fanfare. I have practised yoga for some years, and used to attend yoga classes regularly, twice a week until a few years ago I found I couldn't, didn't want to, face the London commute to get to and from classes. Practising Iyengar Yoga, the 'back bend' class was always the third week of the month (preceded by standing poses first week, sitting low ground poses second week, resting fourth and final week). If back bends wasn't really your thing, (and it wasn't/isn't mine), there was plenty time to anticipate with some apprehension for me, the tough, challenging and demanding back bend class. Not so with today's, Day 10, Uplift practice! At some point during the practice it dawned on me, 'hey, this is a back bend session!'. Congratulations Adriene for easing us into this, mindfully, gently and yes, it was uplifting, and yes, it was also centering.

1256.0,"I was somehow a bit afraid of today’s practice, I don’t know why, but absolutely without a reason and enjoyed every second of it… I’ve been doing the 30 days of yoga journeys every year since revolution (I also did the very first 30 day’s of yoga in the summer of 2016, but couldn’t make it all the way through) and completed a lot of them, but I struggled most of the years and had to force myself to show up although I knew what a positive effect daily yoga had on me. this time around it doesn’t even cross my mind to skip a day, it is just not an option, because I just feel soo much happier and more grounded and have a clear mind and emotional state. I truly feel the sentence of today’s love letter that the mat is a mirror, and how you move on the mat is how you move off the mat. I also feel more than ever how healing deep breathing can be, it is truly magical! (Last week I also listened to a 2 hour + podcast with Adriene and feel connected to her more than ever.

I used my magic age as if it were a wand And never saw the waste and the emptiness beyond The game of love I played with arrogance and pride And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay
