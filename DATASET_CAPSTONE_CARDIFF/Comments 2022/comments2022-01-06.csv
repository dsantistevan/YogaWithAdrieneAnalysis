1.0,"Adrienne : Take a second to see how you feel 
Me : Annoyed, frustrated, betrayed?!! üò©

It has been two years since I've been doing YWA. This is my fourth 30 day journey and this session was by far my least favorite; not because it was challenging, but because it was too reminiscent of everything I hate about ""working out"" in the traditional sense. I grew to appreciate yoga and commit to a regular practice because of YWA. The idea of showing up for myself and exploring what my body is capable of doing really resonated with me, more than pushing my body to its limits in pursuit of some external ideal of what it should look like. This session erred too much on the side of the latter and left me  feeling sad and defeated. I felt there was a huge disjuncture between this core session and the others I've done in the past.....not sure I'll continue with this challenge.",Ugzrv-GvfHQLRCAqjgp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-28T08:49:11Z,-0.9851463437080383

Some of the moves just made no sense whatsoever and looking up is a problem when you're in the middle of a dynamic practice, so I just did whatever I wanted at that point lol. 
Second half was worse because it took such a toll on my neck and back, you're in the same pose for so long and it's not even affecting my core, again. Just hurts. No counter poses. Not even a little stretch at the end? I'd rather this video have been twice as long but feel productive.

I've been trying to tell myself I don't have to do it perfectly every time I do yoga. This has been a really good experiment for me and my body and mind. I let every thought peacefully come to my mind and today came a thought that makes me wanna redo the whole practice. The thought I didn't do enough and wasn't strong enough. That I failed.
 That's a good example of a mind that doesn't connect with the body, bc in my legs, arms, and stomach I feel I couldn't do more. This is something I'm working on.

It involves returning to my inner self and taking care of my body and mind first, so that the physical work I do on the mat can serve me better.

669.0,"Unfortunately, this was the first time when I wasn't able to enjoy Adriene's class at all, and I'm a huge fan of her style, mindset etc. There are usually a few levels during one class, the physical one and/or mental, spiritual, emotional. This class lacked for me depth and it felt just like a work out. Like a set of random exercises for the core. Nothing wrong with that in general, but not what I was hoping for in Adriene's class. Yes, it was tough but maybe if it was combined with other types of poses and not just core, core, core, I wouldn't feel actually fed up and irritated by the end of it all (toughness isn't an issue, nothing wrong with some challenge). But that's only a physical level. I get that the message was to ""light"" core on fire but even the main focus of the messages Adriene was giving was basically giving instructions what to extend, flex etc. The deeper level didn't shine though for me at all. I'm saying all this as a loving feedback because I've been reading comments and I don't see a similar one. If I was the only one feeling like this about this class it's all fine. I will show up tomorrow for sure nonetheless, hoping for the usual nutritious mix of physical, emotional, mental and spiritual inspiration. <3",UgzX0pbX4Qw3lAVaVq54AaABAg,1.0,3.0,2022-01-09T02:46:53Z,-0.7186678051948547

697.0,"Thank you, Adriene, for making these challenges and yoga videos for almost a decade now, and helping me learn to love my own movement for over five years. Your channel is truly a blessing.

However, this practice felt off - I'm not a huge fan of Day 6, but usually it's because I'm frustrated with my own core strength, not because the practice is difficult to follow or doesn't feel like yoga. Some of the transitions were poorly narrated (e.g., moving from the hip lifts to cobbler's pose and back again), several of the movements were very heavy on the shoulders, with barely any warm-up, and the end was just an aerobics class - straight up crunches. This was disappointing, mostly because it didn't feel like it was in line with your many previous takes on yogic core work and there wasn't much of a flow to it. All in all, I'm sorry to say that this practice left me feeling frazzled and sort of like it wasn't a complete practice at all.

I think a disclaimer that this is quite advanced and some more modifications would have helped, especially for the poses that can be tough on shoulders and lower back.

I'm not a total beginner, but this is my first time back to the mat in a couple of years and my body and abilities are different than they were before. That said, I didn't let my feelings stop me from getting on the mat today. I chose to do a different hip-opening episode of about the same length of time to help strengthen and stretch out my hips, which is one of my weak points at the moment. Then I did some independent shoulder stretches and lower-back-strengthening poses. So when I'm back tomorrow for day 7, I'll be stretched refreshed! If there's anyone else who needs to hear this today, this is for you: don't feel discouraged--take it at your pace. You know your body better than anyone else. The fact that you're on the mat is a huge win, whether you finished this session, did some of it, or did something else! Be as gentle with your mind as you are with your body.

And yet during the practice I found myself being grateful for my body and how it is now, that I can move it and that it supports me, albeit in different and sometimes more painful ways than previously. And I felt grateful to myself, for knowing it would be hard and deciding to show up for myself anyway. It felt so good to reach the end of practice and tell myself I love myself.

I started with a video from one of Adriene‚Äôs 30-day challenges, then eventually I developed my own personal practice and managed to do it for a more than a year. But then I got really sick last year and skipped a couple of days, so the daily yoga practice turned into twice a week, to once a month to eventually none again. I could blame it on getting sick, or just being busy with life or just physical and mental exhaustion from working as a nurse, but truth is, I just lost my motivation. There are mornings when I‚Äôm wide awake just in bed scrolling mindlessly on social media or watching random videos on Youtube refusing to move until I have to prepare to go to work again. 

Funnily enough the new year started and as I opened Youtube it was Adriene‚Äôs video that popped up first-an invitation for another 30days of Yoga.

1539.0,"One of my largest personal growth moments has been holding my emotions and not running away with them, particularly the negative ones. I don‚Äôt know why, or what it is about this specific day of practice (I‚Äôve done at least 1 full 30 day journey with Adriene before and countless other videos regularly), but the most ignited thing for me was my anger. Something about this practice being today‚Äôs journey was just not vibing with me, and quickly got me frustrated. My elbows hurt a lot during the side lifts, it felt like I was looking for the relaxing and the calming parts of yoga and today kept hitting the part of a practice I normally avoid. At multiple points, I let out an angry and frustrated ‚ÄúAdriene!!‚Äù while getting into yet another core flexing pose. But what I realized by the end of it was that instead of what historically would be pausing the video and giving up, or switching to a different practice, I actually stepped up to modify and support myself with my needs of the day. I let myself yell and groan through the hard parts. I folded my mat over to cushion but kept with the side lifts. I took breaks when I wanted to give up, but always rejoined the pose for the final moments or movements, even when I wanted to scream (often while letting out at least a little one). The most loving thing I did for myself, which upon reflection made me cry and drove me to write a comment on one of your videos for the first time in years of joining your practice, was telling myself that I‚Äôm not giving up on you, and you‚Äôre worth it. Loving yourself is easy when the work is easy, but showing unconditional love even when faced with frustration and challenges and what feels like meeting limitations is a lesson i‚Äôll be holding deeply close to my heart for a long time ‚ù§Ô∏è",Ugyr1ju3AOJSKDPAXYh4AaABAg,10.0,185.0,2022-01-07T17:38:40Z,0.9617030620574951
