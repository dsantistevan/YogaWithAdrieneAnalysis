45.0,I notice that in a lot of your ywa practices you have us interlace the fingertips together and push away - I am not able to hold this for more than a few seconds. I especially struggle when we interlace fingertips behind the back and press down. Doing that in a forward fold? Not even close to being there. I think it has something to do with wrist flexibility. Are there any alternative suggestions/softer positions that still give you a stretch in the chest and wrists that would help me work up to interlacing fingers and straightening arms?

Loved the session Adriene had prepared but with a very enthusiastic four-year old beside me playing automatic tunes non-stop on her toy keyboard, all the beautiful benefits of yoga went out the window!  Big lesson - if I'm to get the best out of my practice, I have to carve out some alone time.  Adore my little girl but her enthusiastic keyboard playing at top volume is not consistent with a mindful practice - trying not to see it as a wasted session but a lesson in being patient and calm despite the challenges (and the voice in my head screaming ""please be quiet').

Don't think about how you feel today, January you're not in your best mood, so stop thinking, don't bother and simply show up on the mat."" You see, I learned something of you.
I know from the former thirty days there's always a moment of a breakthrough when discipline is no longer needed and  the fun begins. It took a while but today, day 20 in the series, it brook through and I feel at ease with my self. üôÇ

I love rituals and routines, and since summer, yoga is a part of my night time routine. I don't always practice for long, sometimes just 15 min, but I do it everyday, even when I'm sick or on my period. I always feel better afterwards because I feel like I've done something good for myself. The hardest part was to start, and stop making excuses for not doing it. I thought I hadn't the time but that wasn't true. Practices don't have to last an hour, they can be 15 min. Most of us can do it, most people can find15 min of free time everyday, if we're willing to get off our phones. That's how I started, I just reduced my social media/news time in the evening (I still check them during the day, but very rarely at night). I started with short practices and after a while, I found myself craving more. These days, I do about 40-50 minutes every night, except when I'm really tired. Now that it's a part of my routine, and I don't even think of not doing it. I just go home from work at 9 p.m, eat a little snack, roll off my mat, do my yoga, shower and then it's relaxation time :)

543.0,"We are huge fans of using rituals for our yoga and meditation practices. For us it's preparing some tea, listening to some calming music and setting up our dedicated space to practice. We actually recently did a music video called ritual and researched their importance. Not only do rituals give you the opportunity to create habits but they are also unique in their ability to ground you in a specific moment. Because rituals are for all intents and purposes, habits, they become learned behaviours and our brains begin to expect them. We get a sense of satisfaction upon completing it and this is due to a release of dopamine in our brains. Therefore, our brains, which are pre-disposed to order exist in expectation of the completion of certain habitual actions, and we get a boost of dopamine when this need is fulfilled.

I kept on imaging that - just love caressing until I could picture it being me, caressing me.

628.0,For me the ritual is in connecting with myself and focussing inwards and listening to my body. I have been very ill yesterday eve and still forced myself to do the practice. To be honest in this instance i should have rested and dine it in the morning as i got enough time to do 2 a day. The lesson here is about learning about ourselves and treating ourselves with love and respect I feel. So i will move more carefully today and listen more intently.

But at the end of this video, as Adriene was talking about deeply falling in love with ourselves, the weather outside suddenly changed. Clouds covered the mighty sun. I started crying.

I used to struggle with the process, but with move, this yoga journey, I fall in love with the beauty of it. It‚Äôs rarely about my mind judging how good or bad it was, but rather how it feels. How I often even choose to feel, how I breathe, how I am so much stronger and capable. It‚Äôs about the entire process and the entirety of who I am. I am is the most powerful celebration of who I am and  I celebrate this current I am with move, being always in the process, yet always enough.
