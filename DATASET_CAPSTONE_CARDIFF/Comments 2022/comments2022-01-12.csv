This is the 2nd day of doing ""Fire Hydrant"" poses while drawing circles with our legs... But I am just not getting it. I've been trying and trying, but I just do not understand how to do this.

10.0,As a guy I found it an odd thing to try but simple things like sitting with the kids I alway felt uncomfortable because my back and hips were soo tense. I also have a sore wrist. I’ve found my wrist improving soo much and I’m able to sit on the floor more comfortable. I’m finding soo much joy now in the practice since joining this challenge. I first did the Friday night date night I think it was called and felt soo inspired and a sense of self off self love. Love the movements and how open it’s making me feel!

13.0,"Hello everybody. Today I feel little bit lost, sad and confused. I was very hyped for every practice before, but probably I feel some kind of instability and disconnection and I dont feel at all that I am in balance. I did skip yesterday, because probably I did not have enough time for myself and that is the reason because I didnt feel stable, because I was thinking about practice and how I must and above all want to do it, but on the end of the day I didnt, and above all, I did have some disagreement with the love of my life, and I did feel sad about it, and I steel do, even though everything is okay now and we did say sorry to each other, its just that things like that hit me a lot. So I am planing today to do two practices, and this is the first one. I feel little bit more better and I am so thankful for that. Thank you Adriene, thank you so much for that. I am sending you so much love, to you and to everybody. Stay strong guys, and love.

96.0,"Since I'm seeing a lot of ""I fell behind"" comments, I figured I'd pop in and share where I'm at and how I've been approaching this 30 day yoga journey. 

This is my first time participating in a 30 day yoga journey of any kind, and so I'm doing my best to be gentle with myself and listen to what my body wants and needs, whether that be rest, yoga, a different sort of movement, etc. I used to have a daily practice, but I haven't in years, and so I'm treating this as a way to get myself back into a regular practice. Instead of committing myself to do each day of the journey consecutively, I've been doing each day as I feel ready for it while also being mindful of when my body is open to and up for a challenge. For example, at the beginning, I did three days in a row and then I believe I took three days off. Old me would have shamed myself to high heavens for doing that, but after so long of not moving, I needed the rest so that when I came back for day four, I could actually give it my all. Today, I just finished day 12 and I'm feeling better than ever. I've been doing each day as I feel like it, some days I've even been doing other of Adriene's sequences or other movement such as walking or a body workout with my partner. It's been slow and steady, but I hear that's how you win the race.

So long story short, if you're behind on this yoga journey, know you're not alone and that you'll finish it at the exact time you're meant to.",UgxWuZ4L-12b8fynV-94AaABAg,2.0,53.0,2022-01-29T21:01:17Z,0.9308125972747803

107.0,"I misheard the message for today as ""where tension flows energy goes,"" so I found myself trying to make sense of that... and actually coming to some interesting conclusions. They encouraged me to not see difficulty or tension during this practice as weakness but rather, invitation to pursue building strength -- letting tension at my mindful edge change me for the better. I'll carry that into my work today, where I've really been having trouble focusing.

It felt great to really focus on the warmth my efforts were generating and to notice myself getting more confident on the mat during this series. 

Anyway, when it was over, I read the comments, and ofc  ""where ATTENTION flows, energy goes"" makes way more sense. But I'm going with how I heard it. See ya tomorrow.💀",UgyGhuTwPHBn1CsoWc14AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2022-01-27T17:12:22Z,0.9926275610923767

I'm getting a good physical workout, but that's not really why I do yoga. i'm gonna stick with it, but i've had a hard time truly submitting to these practices because i need a little more instruction to inhale/exhale to integrate movement and breath, especially when the flow is fast-paced. plus sometimes we'll do a pose on one side for way longer than the other, or I'll look up at the video and be in a different position because i've misunderstood the direction. i would love more counterstretches too... a lot of these poses are hard on the lower back and i feel like we haven't done a lot of poses to counter that. anyway i'm still learning new things from adriene and always appreciate how she cheers us on throughout her practices.",UgymOjQIujJlg-Or8zN4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-01-18T00:13:41Z,-0.9140894412994385

214.0,"It was great to practice this focus class.  I really realized how I have to work on focus when I am trying balancing postures.  That is the biggest challenge for me.  I had to put my toe down as a kick stand on the right side, but I was able to keep wrapped on the left.  So strange how different each side can be.  I definitely need to come back to this one on a regular basis after I complete the 30 days.  Thank you so much Adriene for your kind and thoughtful teaching technique.

I've always tried to do the most energetic strengthening yoga practice on the days I am feeling well as I think that's what I've got to do to compensate for not moving on other days but these short session are exactly what I need ive been able to every day and it's not feeling like a chore and someday I feel strong in the session with nearly no pain.",UgzxEmPcMuaEc2FeVmx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-15T11:08:38Z,0.5651534199714661

But for the past 3 months, I've been doing mostly Yoga with Adriene, and I'm feeling so much stronger. During this program, I really feel like I'm finally able to really flow, at least half of my transitions aren't so choppy and I'm able to do everything with more ease. Noticing this during this program, I'm really excited to see where my practice goes from here. When I started, I hated doing downward dog for more than 10 seconds. I was thinking ""Adriene, please! Let's move on to the next pose!"" But now everything feels good and the 23 minute practice felt short and I wanted to do something longer and more intense.

708.0,"When you set your knees high up on the backs of the upper arms (pre-crow pose) does it hurt like hell for anyone else? It hurts my upper arms where the knees are on them...SO BADLY that I always have to stop. It strains my wrist as well, but not the roaringly loud pain of the knees-on-upper-arms experience.  ""Play time""...? Um, no. Pain time, more like. I'm sure I'm doing something incorrectly but here at home and alone how can I figure out what corrections I must do? I have tried perching on a block before, but that's a little scary still hurts. If any of you know, please please help me. I've looked online for help and modifications, but no luck.  I am quite tall and weigh 200 lbs so maybe that's part of it? I'm very flexible though, and strong, so...I just don't know.

I told the class that I started doing daily yoga about two weeks ago and my goal is to continue it. My professor got excited and asked if I had ever heard of YWA. I told her that's exactly what I'm doing! Evidently she's done the 30 day challenges for years and we accidently ate up several minutes of class time discussing it.

909.0,"Lately in these practices I've been feeling like I haven't been getting enough out of them, even though I've been going through all the mindful movements, like navel to spine, lengthen in the neck, press down in all four corners of the feet, all that kind of stuff. Physically, I am finding an increase! But I somehow lost the mental, the deeper fulfilment that is the reason I keep coming back. This practice and the email before helped me to realize and re-find what it means to focus! Even though I felt like I was focusing, I was actually quite distracted. Even discouragement is a distraction. Instead, I can go back to the breath. I think I've been having a lot of thoughts of perfectionism! So instead turning back my focus to what I can control brought more love for me, more power. You're falling out of this balance pose, or you missed a couple of Adriene's repetitions? Okay, all good; keep trying. I'm moving in the way that I can. I also chose to just leave my glasses off for the whole practice. They often come off whenever I'm facing down towards the mat, either because the mat is in the way or they're falling off my face, but then I scramble to put them back on if I'm the slightest unsure as to what Adriene is doing. It required a greater trust, but also a greater focus on her words, and I think it helped bring me to myself rather than on the way Adriene looks in her poses. I'm so grateful for this practice! I found a familiar that I love by finding new. Thank you!",Ugyzpo2s1Wt4n2NuZi54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-01-13T13:09:39Z,-0.987272322177887

With my runs building my leg muscles, I need to be careful and slow down how I move—I can’t go as fast as Adriene. But I am not her and she is not me. As I watched and practiced the balance moves at the end, I was reminded of how I felt after recovering from a torn Achilles’ a few years back. How impossible it was to stand on my recently healed leg and balance on a foam mat. Now, years later, I’m a different me and am in a different place, the world is different, and all of that is okay. I’m finding the body-mind connection to be the best lessons. It’ll take me years to be at a level where I can move similar to what I see Adriene doing. But that’s okay. One day at a time.

Especially because my mind was shut off with doubting or not even trying, so I could complete focus on just the movement. Amazing how focus can not only lead to better movements, but also more confidence during the movement. I also really felt whenever I was about to fall over, I could simply focus on the struggling side and put a little more stability into it just alone with focus and strength. I am humbled by this experience.

1035.0,"I read in the tree of yoga how with practice and time, effort becomes joy. This is my 7th year joining and it has felt like the biggest gift to get a chance to come here every day. Effort has become joy. Time for self-study, growth, challenge, exploration and joy. Even in the asanas that I want to give up on I feel so much satisfaction from pushing through and proving to myself I can be disciplined. The only day I struggled to show up on the mat was our rest day (previous years I've struggled many or most days), and that gave me insight in how I move off the mat, that I've had a habit of procrastinating rest. With time the effort to carve out time to rest will turn into joy too. I'm so grateful I get to move with you, learn about myself and find more joy as I do so.

Not fun to be a little sore/fatigued, but what's actually not fun is when these videos stop popping up in your subscriptions! ""Focus"" looks like it'll be awesome",UgwzKvytThCvVG-ZS-Z4AaABAg,1.0,40.0,2022-01-13T04:45:22Z,-0.9892745614051819
1053.0,"I have LOVED everyone single day of this journey so far. I have been part of the Yoga with Adrienne community for about 7 months already, doing yoga everyday has completely changed my life. But unfortunately everyone in my household came out positive to COVID, and I have to be strong and take care of them. I guess I will have to pause this MOVE journey and continue it on next week. I hope my mom gets better soon :’( 
IM ROOTING FOR EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS DOING THIS JOURNEY TOO! Even if something that happens prevents you from doing a yoga practice, just feel great and meditate! (I recommend the Self Love meditation from ADDRIENE, I did it today instead of the Yoga practice, so I can take care of my little sister and mom, I don’t wanna leave them alone for too long) You can continue the journey after, at least that’s how I’m trying to look at it. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO FOR US ADDRIENE. 
NAMASTE🧘‍♀️💜💜",UgxZiR_h8J_yITr5VOR4AaABAg,4.0,23.0,2022-01-13T04:39:23Z,0.9969363212585449
