I am trying to give myself the permission to ask, but it is hard stopping the feeling of anxiety that I will be Too Much. More work on loving myself ahead of me.

And although I always think I‚Äôll cry through the entire practice, inevitably I feel a bit better and a tiny bit healed by the end. Like a warm blanket or a comforting friend, this yoga journey accepts me exactly as I am and has given me the space to feel hard things. Much like my dog has always given me.

This was my first time experiencing that posture and what that felt like in my body. When I couldn't immediately sink into the pose my ego had no trouble stepping in and telling me I couldn't and that I should quit. It wasn't until the second time around where my breath and my heart came through and told me to appreciate the starting point because growth has to happen from somewhere. It was then I felt a shift for the rest of the practice. Today was a challenge in all the best ways.

551.0,"Day 26. A valuable and eye-opening practice. The expression of love to oneself is a process and can be difficult sometimes. We live in a world where there‚Äôs so much going on and I think it‚Äôs quite easy to get lost and agreed, perhaps look to others for love. When we give ourselves this time to be with ourselves, we can sort of catch ourselves and perhaps even find ourselves. Through Adriene‚Äôs guide, the hardest of poses (for me at least), like dolphin, is, I believe, a testament to‚Ä¶ how much we can show love to ourselves.

You form such an intimate relationship with your own self. I haven‚Äôt felt closer to my body EVER. And even on hard days, I showed up and allowed my body to move closer to myself, when it was so hard as I have experienced so much violence and trauma with this body. But Gosh, my body deserves to feel honored, thanked for surviving. My mind deserves to be more present, more connected to the breath. I deserve to feel myself and to gently take care of myself. Thank you, this felt like a spicy love letter to myself. Loved the flow of this one as well.
