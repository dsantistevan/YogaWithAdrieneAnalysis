7.0,"Since yesterday this yoga practice has become more important to me than ever before. A madman started to destroy our neighbouring country (the Ukraine) and our european reality in which respect and freedom are essential values. 
Yesterday I came on the mat at 9. p.m.after 4 hours of demonstrating in Prague city centre and then in front of the Russian ambassy. The practice became overnight for me an essential means to stay sane and carry on as I suppose from now on we will have to live not only with COVID but with war very much present in our lives as well.

previously, i practiced with your videos every single day from july 2020 to may 2021. i never stopped completely, but i fell way off of the daily wagon, and i didn't realize until i began this new program how important it is to keep up with that daily practice as much as possible.

i'm sad that these 30 days are almost over, but luckily, i've got plenty of your other 30-day challenges to go back and do again to hold me over until next January :)

499.0,"This was AMAZING, and I was able to keep up, even if I was a few seconds behind, and what is important in that for me is that I Am Strong and able to MOVE. I found that with being off the mat so long that fear of not being able to simply move and do a pose, even Mountain Pose as that may sound to whomever, was a real concern for me, but I have discovered through positive thoughts and self-talk, calm deep slow breathing, calm careful movement, and visualizing myself being pliable, and what I consider valuable conditioning of my body for 24 days now, that I am Able.  Thank you most phenomenal sweet yogi.  Jai Namaste :)",UgwMDladUCEkJK9DDDB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-26T18:05:09Z,0.999815046787262

569.0,"All the things that I found and took off the mat in terms of physically moving with greater awareness and intention over the last year have culminated and become something that I hardly even think about now. Sit up straight, relax my shoulders, stand with feet facing forward, naval to spine as I bend down to pick something up, etc. I suppose it is still an active thought, but it's not something I have to remind myself of since I've kept up on doing this every day. I understand minute feelings of my body that I could not describe in words. It is a small transformation, and some days of practice I'm not as in tune, and yet I still continue to find something new.

I have learned to look for a yoga that teaches me the awareness of the body, of the breath, the slowness of the movements more than the fatigue in carrying out an asana sequence. For all this I thank you from my heart.",UgwGrPODZrfsfKvCLBd4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-01-26T10:30:06Z,0.9995170831680298
