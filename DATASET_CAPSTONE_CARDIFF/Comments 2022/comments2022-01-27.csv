8.0,"I feel like I do have to agree with a lot of comments. This practice was hard. I managed pretty well (some child's poses instead of down dogs and), but while I am not the most experienced participant here, generally hard practices were shorter and I felt that that was a great motivator to do it anyway. I still have some hidden core strength from my roller derby days which is what made this managable, but I can't say I feel very ""zen"" so I can imagine how it feels for the people who struggled more. Maybe something to think about for next year! I did part of Breath last year and I do find the progression of Move quite steep in comparison.

It has been our little January ritual to do yoga in the living room together, it’s been so much fun! We really noticed our bodies and minds getting stronger because of our regular practice. Unfortunately we both caught covid the last week of January. I’ve only just got back to my mat and this practice asked a lot of me. Thank you Adriene for reminding me that what I most need is forgiveness and not *getting back into shape asap*. I will spend my final days of Move practice making sure my movement aligns with my new breathing pattern and being forgiving to myself for getting behind on the challenge.

Somehow I found the strength to keep going, although I wasn't breathing through the abs work at the end, and when the third round started, my inner rant began.  Interesting how I always get so angry when I'm being physically pushed, like it's just SO UNFAIR!!!

But Adriene kept me so motivated with all the little words of encouragement. And I did everything, without needing to take a break. I am so amazed by what my body can do and how strong I've become! And so proud of myself and grateful to Adriene and this community. I realize that often in life I give up, because I think I cannot do it, instead of trying.

439.0,"About four days ago the scoliosis in my lumbar spine started really acting up. I got some constant pain that I’ve never had there for this long. And it’s been sticking with me. At this point I’m only assuming it’s my scoliosis, it could be a muscle strain or something more severe. But for now I’m gonna call it my scoliosis.

This has made the last few days of yoga really challenging and in turn it’s triggered a flare up of my fibromyalgia and cfs. So I’m exhausted and in tons of pain in my whole body now. Yesterday I really pushed myself too far in yoga even though I thought I was being careful, I ended up so sore I felt like crying.

So today, through this strong practice, I adapted the whole time. I lifted my legs and touched my knees to my elbows while in table with a pillow under my knees. Taking breaks as I needed to. I took a couple down dogs, but mostly adapted with puppy posture and a pillow under my knees. I took every movement slowly and stoped if I felt any sharp pains. I focused on my breath and I definitely still got sweaty.

But lemme tell you, my back is thanking me for adapting today. Maybe next month I’ll be able to do this one, maybe not. But I’m proud of myself for intentionally adapting and inviting softness and compassion into this practice. I hope this encourages any of you who’ve been struggling with these practices due to injury or fatigue or sickness or mental health.

You got this, take what you need, leave what you don’t.

Adapting through the whole practice can bring you beautiful things. It doesn’t lessen, it deepens. It brings you closer to yourself and it’s a loving gesture that your body and mind will thank you for 💜",UgyTbTUwsBw-BiM0Gpx4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-01-29T02:48:06Z,0.997787594795227

I used to not be able to do planks, push ups, sit ups, etc.  I can do these things now.  I am strong, strong body and strong mind.  Thank you, Adriene, and the rest of this beautiful community for inspiring me every day. Namaste 💛",Ugy_6gc2Qzw5JbKdTMh4AaABAg,0.0,10.0,2022-01-28T22:16:35Z,0.9915749430656433

540.0,"This practice was a challenge for me. I definitely did it at my own pace. Side note, my boyfriend snickers every time Adriene mentions Up Dog. He wfh in the living room while I do yoga. When I first started he would always reply to her with ""what's up dog"". There is something about his playfulness and humor that adds something to the practice. It sort of helps me take this less seriously. Reminds me to have fun with it. Adriene was the first yoga instructor who taught me that having a laugh during the practice is a good thing. 

Big thank you to Adriene and the community! I can't remember how many of the 30 day journeys with Adriene I've done but I do know that I learn something new about myself and the practice each time. ❤️",Ugz4dBk9D3odLJIp5Zt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-28T22:17:04Z,0.999212384223938

Someone had left a comment saying that every time Adriene says ""I am strong"" during a plank, she would say ""Ruth Bader Ginsberg"" because of the footage showing RBG doing a plank. Seconds later as I left the room where I do my yoga I heard the news of her passing announced on TV. Ever since then, I have continued that fellow yogi practice of saying ""I'm strong - Ruth Bader Ginsberg"" every time Adriene prompts, and I know that if she could do what she did, I can do this! 💕🧘‍♀",UgwRbQKRotjpEMbUQjt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-28T21:12:45Z,-0.9777096509933472

After years, on and off, of YWA as well as this being my 57th day of yoga in a row, I still seriously struggled. When Adriene said ""Whisper to yourself, I am strong"" I just yelled ""F*** you!"" not very yogi of me ahaha, but it was a very real reaction in that moment, feeling seriously challenged and weak, doubting myself and all I've worked towards these past couple months. Coming through that anger and those tears though, getting back on the mat and doing what I could in that moment showed me that I truly am a lot stronger than I thought. It may not be the physical strength that I thought I wanted but instead having the ability to show up exactly as I am, yell and cry, feel the anger, pain, and sadness but then come back. Today I may not have nailed the poses or even have come close but I didn't give up on myself and that is my strength.

766.0,"Wow. I am so humbled by this journey. I've been practicing for over 15 years and every year Adriene's 30 days teaches me something new. 

But this year... something is different. It's so powerful, so intense, so deep and so heartfelt. I am again, so utterly humbled and today's practice was the icing on the cake. Not because I could lean in and push through but because I could FEEL it so DEEP. The intention, the willpower and the extreme love I feel when I move (and yes, muscles too 😅) and after I have moved.

This is not just a yoga journey. It's an inner journey of (re-)learning our inner strength and stamina. While we're moving we're also conditioning our mind to take the practice off the mat. Moving is hard but so is showing up as a human being in all situations. And I can truly say that I am becoming a much better person this January. I've gained strength, stamina, courage, grace, a sense of ease, kindness (to myself and others), acceptance... the list goes on and on. 

I wish there was a more powerful way to say ""thank you"" but I think you know what I mean, and I think I speak for most of us, when I say that our gratitude is beyond. From my heart to yours, Adriene, wow! ❤️🙏🏻",UgxYU-MFZjFQiT71TKF4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-01-28T15:39:48Z,0.9986556768417358

768.0,"I've really been enjoying this 30-day yoga journey. I think it may be Adriene's best yet. Almost every practice has seemed nearly perfect for my mood that day, and I come off the mat feeling more positive and energized than I did before... EXCEPT TODAY! This practice was not for me today. It was far too much for my wrists. It caused physical and emotional discomfort. I was encouraged to get on the mat today, then about halfway through, had a mental breakdown that continued for the rest of the practice and afterwards. I don't think this practice was designed well - far too much on the wrists and too fast of a pace that felt totally unaligned with the rest of this journey. I found comfort in the comments, that other folks had a similar experience. Just a little constructive criticism and venting, I guess. Adriene has a HUGE audience and I can't expect EVERYTHING she does to resonate with me (though it usually does). Still, I thank Adriene from the bottom of my heart.

796.0,"I worry that I didn't activate my deep core muscles enough during all those three-legged dogs to the knees because it doesn't feel as it does when we do core work laying on the ground, like in the final poses. But I do know that I've found a greater sense of my core and understanding of what it feels like to activate it--so trusting in that, I will trust that I did all I could for me today. The final scissoring legs up and down felt way easier than it probably would have a couple weeks ago, or perhaps even thirty minutes earlier, had I not been all warmed up from the other intense work! The rest on my shoulders made that feel like a restful pose somehow. It makes sense to me to learn that activating the deep core muscles activates the hope molecules, because I always find those exercises to be the most satisfying!

It was like trying to hold the ocean in our hands, no matter how hard we tried, it was impossible. This new mindset has helped us to let go and make every moment momentous.

Her speed was way too fast for me, so I slowed down and went at my pace.

969.0,"Adriene I am beyond greatful for these journeys and practices you provide for us! If I could offer some feedback: 1. today's session was FIRE! so tough and challenging. Maybe I am alone in this, but I would love if this session was preceded by a leg-dominant session. the last few days left my shoulders SORE and it was a bit disheartening to not be able to complete all the poses and flows. Maybe having this specific practice after a leg-dominant or rest day would be less tiring.
2. mountain climbers and 3-legged dog to mountain climber uses a surprising amount of inner thigh! I noticed this journey is a little more geared towards the upper body (and I love! that), so I was very surprised by the inner thigh muscles activating. I would personally love some more poses isolating the inner thighs sprinkled into the practices.

Again, this is all just feedback I give with love and support - sharing my personal experience in hopes it can resonate with some, and perhaps even improvements for the next year!
