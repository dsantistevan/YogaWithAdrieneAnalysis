I have sweaty hands and feet :/ this is why downward facing dog is a nightmare for me, I keep on sliding away or even collapsing down.

(Cause I feel like I know you) I began this journey on New Years with intentions of finishing with folks who began then too. Well life happens and so do Covid surges lol. I’m a burnt out RN and sometimes don’t fell like working out. No matter how relaxing yoga makes my muscles feel. Some days I rather lay on the couch, in front of TV and not think. Know what I mean. But I always come back to yoga! Self cares yo! Your soothing voice and lighthearted humor brighten my spirits. Today was day 19, just barely managing to getter dunnnn. I feel better and ready for bed. Thank you for your dedication. Otherwise I would be sitting on the cough right now, watching mindless reruns… Know any series I can binge? Haha. JKJK!

6.0,"When I started this yoga journey I didn't miss a single day, I was so proud of myself because no matter how tired or busy I was I somehow found time to honor my commitment to this journey. Until day 19. Then I got covid and it all went downhill from there. I went through so much stress and sadness but I finally recovered and remembered a promise to myself to get back on the mat and continue practicing. I felt weak and as if I had lost all progress, but I feel so much better now that I have completed Day 19 and I am back on track.

I loved how I had to hold the side stretch, I always feel that I release some weight when I do that. I feel so relieved and relaxed in my muscles when I do that.

17.0,"I am way behind, but working through the days one at a time.  I have finally completed day 19 (2/17/22)  and am determined to finish.  
This practice has been very helpful to me this year, in ways I didn't expect.  On an emotional level, I feel the breath work helping me manage strong feelings.  I'm working on speaking boundaries when they are needed rather than gathering tension until it explodes. On a physical level, I finally feel like I know how to engage my abs (after all these years!!) and it has made my other forms of exercise much more focused and beneficial.

Often, it makes me feel frustrated. 

BUT TODAY, WOAH! I'm having a mild fever today and stomach pain, yet I went through the whole practice without pausing or rewinding. I was able to stay through the extended side angles aka the 'hard, foundational poses.' 😉 It was amazing-- at some points I was like, ""Woah, I did THAT?""

I practice after work, when I'm still full of restless energy and I've noticed that jumping straight into moving asanas help me relax a lot more than sitting down and breathing. It's like I need to get rid off all that bad energy by moving, and once that's done, I can finally focus. I will do this practice again after we're done with this 30 days journey.

Time will tell (no pun intended) as I continue the move series for the next several days.  I always enjoy exploring new ways and perspectives.

538.0,"I am rehabbing from a sever break in my ankle.  After with two surgeries, terrible bone infections, a fall off my dang scooter and re-injury when I got too confident and the wheel caught on a tiny pebble tracked in on the floor...grrrrr.  Coming up on two years later I'm only in episodic pain and can walk with almost no limp.  But I never thought I'd be able to sit cross legged again.  

Then I could do that and while it was doubtful I would be able to cross them the opposite way I was so glad.  Then I could do that, but I would probably never be able to sit back on my toes either curled under OR with the tops of my feet flat.  Then I could but never for very long.  Now I can do it for much longer and it even feels good!  

Will I ever be able to do tree poses and maintain my balance again?  Will I ever be able to do a deep Asian style squat and keep my balance?  My balance is way off because of the atrophy in muscles in my feet, core, hips and legs that have atrophied for almost two years... My ankle doesn't bend all the way like that anymore.  Or will it...with gentle patience...in time?  I don't know but I'm feeling stronger and more flexible with each passing day and am feeling SO much better in my body.  I am grateful Adrian.

Just want to encourage others who may have struggled today. Our bodies have days when they are more flexible and days when they are more tight. Showing up every day really allows us to “ be kind to ourselves” and slowly grow our practice. 
This is the tip of the iceberg for me. This year is my 365 days of yoga. I know every day won’t look the same but I’m constantly building and getting more in tune with my body.

581.0,"Almost one year ago, after the first 30 day journey we did with Adrienne, we were in a state of reflective turmoil. One of us had lost our job due to downsizing and we decided to start investing in ourselves by rekindling old passions and hobbies. From there, we decided to start a youtube channel to share videos we were creating for our anxious son to calm him and to use as sleep aids. We found a passion and a community and began finding ourselves smiling much more often. Today, our channel hit 10K subs and we cannot believe it. This confidence, this drive to push ourselves, came from a simple choice to try after doing 30 straight days of yoga with you! We are so grateful and love the self-assurance and inner peace yoga and meditation has brought to our lives. Life is too short not to explore your potential and your passions.

I allowed myself to take breaks this time around, and really listened to the voice inside me that was saying to not push it today. I think in all my efforts to make space in my shoulders, I was actually tensing them and pushing them away from my ears with too much effort! So today's emphasis of exploration for me was to see how I can move in every pose with relaxed shoulders. It caused my face, that often gets a little scrunched up in my focusing, to easily relax along with it. It was different, and I feel that I didn't go ""all in"" to each of the poses, but I at least attempted every pose, and I'm trying to accept this as okay and wonderful.",Ugxdal5SbdB2evG5-ud4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-20T13:28:32Z,0.9641905426979065

634.0,"This is the farthest I've ever gotten in one of your Journeys, and I'm so happy to be here. This thing is quite literally the only thing getting me out of bed some mornings. I started a business as a reiki practitioner and havent been getting the clients I need (Let's be real though, I'm a badass on the table both in person and distance) and I'm broke right now living with my parents at 24, and I am soooooo hard on myself and the morning is spent ruminating until i finally drag my behind out of bed and put Adriene on, because otherwise I will miss the day. Yesterday I just straight up started crying when I heard your voice, doing the moves and just WEEPING while doing them. I feel so much better every time I do yoga though, so this is a wake up call to stick with it after this journey is over. To anyone out there thinking of quitting, dont. Take a rest if you need to. But if this practice brings even a smidge to you of what it brings to me, complete this journey and stick with it after.

I came down to the mat feeling a little less energised, left the mat with this sudden urge to do something meaningful for myself, so I drank some tea. Yoga has opened so many doors to myself that I hadn’t seen opened before, offering such a different perspective to not only life but also how I carry myself through each day. I think, it’s very true, the notion of ‘how you move matters’ because for me the exploration assisted in seeing what would potentially really help me a bit today, that being a nice cup of tea. Enabling that sense of gratefulness for myself and those around me today. Thank you all and Adriene for guiding us.

I focused on exploring what and how today’s movement felt like and got the insight how my left side was far more hesitant und less energized than the right side. And looking now back, that’s us in daily life. Some parts take more time or temporary are harder to move. We are so complex, it’s really important to understand the duality and complexity of ourselves. It’s okay to want to do things, but to struggle with moving ourselves in some areas. That was so interesting today, what an insight that there is so much to move and how we can have all different states of comfort and hesitation in all areas. Moving on, moving towards what we are and want, is a complex, but very rewarding process.

742.0,Today has been a rough one for me. The anxiety is loud this morning and I love that what is getting me through it is knowing that we'll be live in less than an hour. This practice is everything to me. It is literally my foundation for grounding. A space I can land on and grow from. I am a little weirded out by it. The fact that I am not a jumbled ball of nerves. Instead I am choosing to hold my head high despite feeling like I'm going to implode. I am looking forward to exploring this more with today's perfectly picked theme. Thank you Adriene. I will forever be grateful to you and your team for showing me how to accept myself so deeply. For giving me a way to find peace in the middle of a hurricane. I hope everyone has a great exploration of practice today. I'm proud of you all. I love myself. I love you. 🖤,UgzQ4GrmDe14XoWnzwt4AaABAg,14.0,173.0,2022-01-20T09:33:32Z,0.9996433258056641
