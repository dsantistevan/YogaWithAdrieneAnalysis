34.0,I definitely struggled with day 4 - this flow was so fast and I am a very fat and heavy person with mobility unlike Adrienne's. So I couldn't keep up and got frustrated because I couldn't even settle into one pose before she was 2 more posed ahead. I ended up just waiting for the fast flow to end. I was ultra aware of my body and how my clothes were squeezing me and I just felt unfocused. But the sitting portion grounded me a bit more and I was able to finish strong.

I would just like to say, for someone who is new or for anyone. In one moment I felt like everything is too fast and that I do not like because you must listen carefully so you can follow Adriene, but she did constantly repeat everything, so on the end you feel totally in control of everything, and you just go into Flow, and as you see, the name of practice is just like that, Flow. So that is one lesson more than this practice and everything that it brings to all of us. Be patient, believe in the process and in the fact, that if you stay to the end of practice, you will get in touch, get in control, get in flow. So believe it, just believe, you can do it.

85.0,I am trying so hard with these but each one infuriated me and leaves me feeling angry and frustrated because she simply WONT STOP TALKING! Adriene is so sweet and spiritual and calm but SO SLOW. She spends more time talking about anything and everything it the moves and how to do them than actually doing them. This is definitely not for people who are not new to yoga. Yoga should be a flow and this feels more like a stagnant boring talk about what she is doing rather than actually flowing into each move and doing the work. I wanted to like these so much but I should not be feeling this angry and frustrated each day while doing them.

278.0,"So way late and mostly doing this as a get fit routine. I loved the first three days very much, but honestly this felt a bit too hard. Not because of the poses, but because the flow aspect kinda means you need to know what you're doing. And I suck at physical coordination.

So it worked like Adrienne says something, I'm like ""what?!"" look at the screen and see/hear her move three poses on. That was especially bad during the warrior switches and it'd have been really helpful if she repeated instructions (not just say it once) - because it's far too easy to miss exactly what she said when you're still focussing on the previous pose.",UgzotLyG2c4U8D5vQDx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-18T09:34:19Z,-0.998528003692627

I did day 4 today, and it felt so good, i already notice that i'm feeling stronger in practise and i have more balance now than on day 1.

I had no motivation of excersining at the beginning of this year - but now i feel a lot better doing yoga for the past 4 days. Mentally i've struggled but i feel more calm now just listening to and gratifying myself. Honestly, I didn't think that this yoga-practice-plan would do this for me. But this has worked so well for me! And as Adriene has said many times already... the hardest part is showing up.

I did random ones sporadically through the pandemic, but this is my first time doing a 30 day challenge. On day 2, I felt pretty rough, but ever since, I've felt stronger and more in touch with my own body and process. Part of the reason that is happening, instead of my usual self-flagellation, is your openness to modifying, being gentle with oneself, and the way you explain things in the context of the bigger picture. That makes it harder for negativity to take hold, because there are constant reminders throughout your instruction that remind me to re-focus.

I have done it before on Adrienes other videos and had an amazing experience today. As I inhaled from hands to the earth, I focused all of my energy from root to sacral to solar plexus and paused at the heart (which is the center of all chakras), then the next inhale I moved up from throat to third eye to crown and exhaled focusing from crown to root back the opposite way. Usually I have trouble focusing on the present waiting for my hands to touch eachother or the ground, but after focusing on the energy centers, pausing at the heart and moving back up to the crown then back down again, I rediscovered a new way to move through that motion. I hope this helps anyone who have also struggled focusing the mind when moving through those motions. Thank you Adriene!",Ugxha3jhuAZZnqjxHVl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-07T21:33:56Z,0.9992353916168213

There are some movements that are harder than others but it is a great challenge for my brain and body. I am also getting better at remembering to breathe during the sequence. My core and abdominal are perhaps the weakest part of my body, but I can feel Yoga is helping  so much as I know that it is important to have a strong core.   After having four children and raising my family life got busy. I'm looking forward to the next 26 days of Yoga Move and know that I have to continue to stay in shape after the 30 days.

1719.0,"To be completely honest with you, Adriene, although I truly love your practices I have to force myself onto the mat sometimes. 
My brain finds new ways trying to convince me not to do something that I know is actually good for me.
""No, this is boring / exhausting, you will sweat, you will be tired afterwards, you will be sore, you will be out of breath and so on.""
If you used to look for reasons to stay in your comfort zone it's easy to find reasons why you shouldn't do what you want to / should do. 
This reminds me of you saying: ""The hardest part is showing up."" 
It's true because once I step onto the mat and press play I rarely go back.

Sometimes we have to force ourselves to do what's best for us.

1754.0,"Oof today was hard
I tend to struggle with full 'flow' practices, needing to an extra breath in a pose before transitioning. And when we took the 'break' i finally felt connected and just, stayed there. For the last round i stayed in down dog and just timed my breaths, trying to embody them fully, and them joined back in for the end.

It's funny, i think that's where I am in my life now. I spent so much time moving around my shit. And finally realizing that, and trying to adjust to move through instead has been difficult, and I feel stuck. So maybe like today's practice, I do need the time to sit and build up my tools...

Anyway, will be back tomorrow, and I think I'll take some time before practice to meditate a little: fall in, notice my breath and then deepen it, like we were doing in the breath journey. I think that'll help. Mindfully calling up my tools as preparation and all that

I wasn't expecting to love it so much, and it also helped with my anxiety that was getting worse a while ago because of my meds. I tried yoga a couple years ago but wasn't very into it, and now I see it was because I wasn't doing with Adriene! I never realized how much strength you need, not only balance, and I love feeling more strong and flexible each day, even tho I was already working out for almost a year now - that's an entirely new experience, not just physically but mentally. Like, I couldn't understand how to feel my inner tights engaged while in warrior pose, or feel that lift, and today, with this video, I realized I fully did feel it! It was a great sensation, and I really loved that pause to breathe in the middle before coming back.

I cannot thank Adrienne enough for these practices. I don't always feel like doing yoga but I always feel better for doing it. My mental health has been at an all time low and today I found myself dipping, half heartedly, distractedly joining. I can't do this, my body isn't a yogi body, I can't balance, I'm not strong. Then I said I AM STRONG aloud, a little voice crept in...I can do this. We sat midway and mindfully flowed, without knowing, I was focused. A strong breath guiding me, the next downward dog? I CAN without a doubt.

2094.0,"I can write something like I was unable to discipline or motivate myself after 4/5 days last year, but this year after a 108 Vinyasa in December, I feel more confident and yoga become a meaningful practice of awareness. I thought about my parents who become depressed and alcoolic with several cardias issues since the age around 40. And during this 108 Vinyasa I thought about how Running, yoga and others physical practices can help me to get through the fear of become unable to move and hope for the Future like my parents.

My thought was like this : since I continue to practice, to move, to daily create movements, I can trust the process and create my own path. I‚Äôm not religious but spiritual and for me it seems like an act of faith : we don‚Äôt know what a practice can bring us, but we have to move forward.

I love that the theme of this 30 Days is Move.

2099.0,"In september this year, I found my daily life change completely as my panic attacks and anxiety left me unable to work or leave the house. I had to learn how to even take walks again, as any type of movement that ups the heart rate or tires my body past a certain level triggers my fight or flight. But I started doing yoga with adriene from mid September on a near daily basis and allthough slow, I can see so much progress. Before september I worked out 3 days a week and was in a physically demanding job and so I was always on the go. But I felt I was just moving without purpose, and moving without stopping to rest and notice what was manifesting inside. For the last 3 months I hardly move and I've noticed the massive decline in my strength and endurance. This 30 day journey allthough extremely tough mentally (and physically) at some points, feels like exactly what I need to wake up  and ( more importantly) feel safe in my body again.

That was such a nice reminder as I choose to Move towards new changes (embracing new changes to my schedules, my new job, my new own practices :) )OMG I really REALLY enjoy this flow - that pause in between where we practice breath and MOVEment of hands 
So subtle and so effective as I really find that align when I/we go back to sequence - wow
