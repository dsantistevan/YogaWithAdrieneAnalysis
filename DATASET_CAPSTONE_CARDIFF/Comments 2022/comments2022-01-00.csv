So I was in the middle of the 30 day challenge (and loving it!) when I got hit with Covid and my body forced me to take a break. I had just finished day 14, and now that I am feeling strong enough to give it another go, I am wondering should I start at day 15, or go back to day one?

I had gallbladder removal surgery just over a month ago which caused a lot of stress and life altering changes in my life.
Due to this, I have decided to not follow this program to the T but more like doing it alongside you all while also making sure I can do what I can at this moment in my life.
Ive decided to do it in 60 days instead of 30, meaning that I will take a day break between each yoga practice.
I am so so excited to come along this journey with all of you! I will be a little bit behind, but I will be with you either way.

368.0,"Will be following along with a day's delay due to the new upload schedule :) (mornings are the best time for me to do yoga, as I tend to forget otherwise)
When asked the question what I would like to move towards, I imagined a wardrobe or drawer with lots of little compartments. It is a place where everything has its own place, nothing is cluttered or misplaced. For me this is a mental image for my life and my use of time. I would like to be able to keep work and other obligatory things in their own ""box"", so I could have the freedom to fill up the other boxes with more meaningful things (spending time with loved ones, language learning, doing projects). And kind of keep this mindset that you can always jump back into it. Sometimes the cupboard might be messy, but then you just need to take a breather and try to create order again :)",Ugz7rQ2ZnUvuEp_fY914AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-02T20:31:48Z,0.9939595460891724

The last few months of 2021 I tapered off with my consistency as I was in a huge transitional stage in my life. I am excited to see another 30 day journey starting this year and will use it to help me ease back into my daily practices. 

I need some advice though! I started a new job a little over two months ago and it’s very labor intensive with my hands / wrists. 

I can’t even go into downdog anymore unless I use my fists :( the pain in my wrists is horrible and I was hoping you could point me in a direction to work on strengthening / loosening my wrists.

Not to toot my own horn but I’ve always been extremely flexible and blessed with being naturally included to yoga. This is really the first thing I’ve struggled with in the realm of yoga and it’s very dis encouraging. Any and all advice is appreciated.

452.0,I’m really looking forward to doing one of these 30 day journeys again. I actually haven’t done yoga in a couple years now after doing it for quite awhile—and I loved these journeys before. They really felt powerful to me in the past. I’m glad to be taking the step to do this again. I’m choosing to move toward myself—I feel in some ways I’ve lost some things that I miss and I’d like to step back into myself. I want to cut out some distractions and really make sure I’m listening to my inner voice and actually doing the things that feel good to me. Thank you for this Adriene—you are my favorite yoga guide and I’m happy to be back hearing your lovely words and affirmations. You have such a calming and welcoming presence that I’m excited to have back in my life starting this month. ✨,UgwGUUg34HHRQFbBINp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-02T13:20:54Z,0.99951171875

She said that we need to have time for this….I hope the videos are not going to be 30min+ up to 45min.  It’s too long and puts new yogis off.

Then, a week later my son ended up in the hospital with a critical and life altering condition: Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome, SMAS. He almost died. I had to drive back and forth, an hour, to the hospital every day. October came,after three weeks, and my son was sent home with his feeding tube and specialist appointment after specialist appointment. 

Then I got sick with a sinus infection that turned into bronchitis. I have been having trouble breathing for over  a month now, no energy, depressed and “lost.” 

Needless to say, even after my knee I was healed, I fell out of my practice out of sheer exhaustion.

Adriene, watching this video was like having a long lost friend give me a hug. Breathing with you again and hearing your kind generous voice made me cry a little. I NEED this! I need to get that little piece of “me” back!

738.0,"The last time I successfully completed one of these on time was in college I think... since then I've done some throughout the year and I've fallen off the wagon, but this time I'm really committed and disciplined.

""Move"" is a really loaded term for me right now. I had plans to move--to relocate--to live closer to a romantic partner, but now that's not a thing. 2022 is the year I've decided to unlearn things, and for me, ""move"" is one of those terms. It's not only about uprooting and relocating to a physical location. Moving can be the intentional effort of being present and aware and in tune with my body and my needs and not neglecting myself anymore to pursue what I think everyone else wants me to be.

So MOVE in this context is to return to center and to unlearn the concept that I am a product of everything else around me. No. I am myself and myself might be comprised of the universe but I am not solely what everyone else defines me to be or needs me to be. I need to define myself. I need to show up for myself. I need to grow for myself. I need to be in touch with myself for my own benefit. Moving is my control of my body because of my will. And my will and my needs and my desires and all that I am are important and not to be lost to the world.

This will rock my foundation and my world view but it is the challenge I think is necessary and I am prepared to embark on.",UgzlIQB46sP13FqGLwt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-02T00:08:45Z,0.996423065662384

1129.0,"Thank you Adriene for doing this every year - I have so much love for YWA and Benji 💖
 I've been doing these 30 day yoga journeys since Yoga Camp and they are a unique opportunity to reconnect with myself and my love for yoga alongside the most awesome community 😭♥️ 
I don't have a new year's resolution in the traditional sense. I just want to love myself for who I am and be ok with that . And I mean ALL parts of myself including the anxious part who cares about others (sometimes too much -particularly when it comes to caring about their opinions). I am slowly learning to let go of my perfectionist and people-pleasing tendencies. I burnt out in 2021 and mentally I was in a bad place so this year I really want to put myself first and do the things I want to do, not what I think I should do. 
Yoga with Adriene and meditation have been absolutely key to this ongoing journey of self-awareness and self-love.
It feels so great to share how I feel, and not be scared/ashamed. In time I hope we can all find out voices and speak our truths.
 Sending love and peace to anyone who reads this. I am grateful for this community 🌟",UgwWRRLygye4UAiSaLt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-01T18:36:11Z,0.9966232776641846

1133.0,"So I did 30 days of daily yoga in January 2021…and then I kept going. I wanted to be able to sit on the floor with my students. I wanted to be able to move with less aches and pains. I followed Adriene's monthly practice calendar for the past 365 days. Every day. I really resonate with the principals encouraged in the practices:
Bring the breath.
Showing up on the mat is the hardest part.
Find what feels good for your body.
Take what you need and leave what you don’t.
Things I’ve gained: 
1. Carved out time for myself every single day. Even if it was only a 7 min bedtime practice, I got on the mat every day.
2. I suck at time management and many of my practices happened at 11 pm or later. Gotta work on this for the coming year.
3. I can sit on the floor, cross legged, with my students and get up without help! This was really the goal all along. I just wanted to be able to do my job better which included getting to the floor with my students.
4. Extended child’s pose is amazing…but I’ve also found myself in tears many times in this position of total surrender.
5. Yoga is emotional. I’ve cried many, many times as emotions get released from the craziest places like your hips! Who knew?!
6. I never thought I would consider Down Dog as a position of rest but it can be. Again, who knew?
7. In times of stress and time crunch, some days, all I could manage was a bedtime routine or a 10 min stretch routine. I tried to give myself grace on those days (and there were many) and be happy that I made it to the mat.
8. I find that my body actually craves the daily stretch and flow of yoga now which is mind boggling to me.
9. Practice really does make things better. Not perfect. Better.
10. I like consistency and found this yoga practice design to be spot on for consistency. Some days, the daily practice dialed in on exactly what I needed and for the length of time that I could handle. Not sure how they knew that! And it provided just the right amount of challenge for me so that I looked forward to practicing most days and didn’t feel defeated.
11. I have a long way to go and much more flexibility to gain physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.
12. I talk to God a lot during my practice. For me, God is my higher power and acknowledging and being grateful for this amazing life I get to live on a daily basis with a body that is a work in progress was a gift. Take the time. You won’t regret it. I'm ready to flow into 2022 with a steady practice as my anchor.

I started yoga in the fall of 2019 after a heartbreak, when I travelled to India and did a yoga retreat, but I haven´t really been doing it as often as I should. I did HOME after lockdown in March 2020, and I did it again now in December 2021, and been doing yoga now and then outside of this. I have been depressed since September, and this time I am really going to commit to doing yoga every day, as I can feel the benefits it is giving me, especially during this time. I hope that I can go back to India and do a yoga teacher training one day. 

Move towards better days.

1845.0,This is really life changing. I started a 30 day journey from last year in August and although I couldn’t do it all exactly the difference it made to my mind and body is truly incredible. I have kept it up almost daily since then and it is the me time that I don’t give up in my day. I am more centred and grounded and calm and ready to take on life. Main thing I took from it was if u fall off the wagon no biggie just do it the next day and even if you can only squeeze in 20 minutes it’s better than nothing. It doesn’t have to be a 60 minute workout for it to be worth it for your body. Some days you will just not be feeling it and cannot do what you did previously but keep coming back and do what you can and make it ‘your time’ for loving yourself and honestly it’s a game changer. Can’t wait to do it real time this year. Good luck everyone😊 thanks Adriene you are a guiding light- truly🙏💕,UgxdSnkhBRqO37BKGKl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-01T11:41:43Z,0.999743640422821

I’ve been doing a bit of yoga on and off now this year with your videos. When I started I couldn’t even sit down on the floor at first. I could hardly move and got a lot of back pain and back spasms during the day. No I’ve only had 1 back spasm in the last few weeks and I can sit in the floor first thing in the morning and I can even do downward dog (still struggling getting my heels on the floor). I can roll over in bed without getting back spasms. I can also bend down and pick up things off the floor. These are all things I couldn’t do at the start of 2021. Imagine what I can do at the start of 2023.

I have not alway been able to maintain  a daily practise but utilising the 30 day challenges  helps bring me back to a yogic rhythm. Her reminder to take time out for myself has helped me so much. This will also be the first time I have commenced the 30 day journey live. It may take me more than 30 days:)  buts that okay. Thank you Adriene.

There were moments I felt so weak I thought even the most basic poses might break me, and as a young and otherwise in shape person that was scary. I wanted to give up, but I didn't. I took a step back, went back to the basics, and focused on my breath. I explored these poses with a new sense of curiosity and discovered strength, that after years of yoga, I didn't know I had. So, my resolution this year is to stay curious. Every time I think I have things figured out when it comes to my body, I realize there is something new to discover. The illness didn't go away, but I feel stronger now than I did before the diagnosis. Thank you for that. P.S. Everyone should be doing Day 16 of Breath daily.
