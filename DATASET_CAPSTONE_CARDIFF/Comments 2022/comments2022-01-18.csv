No one can take it away

200.0,"I have to say, I was so disappointed with myself that I didn't manage to do this on two days. Feeling very low on confidence anyhow at the moment, that didn't help.

But then I remembered Adriene's words from a previous journey, where she said something along the lines of ""imagine that right now, you are exactly where you need to be"" and then I realized that now, slightly behind everyone else, the practices suddenly perfectly align with my days. Yesterday where I could only do it in the late evening, there was the lovely snuggly practice to send me off to bed. Today, where I had time and feeling unusually active (even went for a run for the first time this year), there's this beautiful, slightly longer practice.

And as confidence was lagging again during the twist when I saw my skin folds, I said to myself ""But look, how strong I am! I am so strong!"" and I lifted the corners of my mouth and all was well.

And the mantra ""My breath is my anchor, my anchor is my breath"" has really become a tool for me. A crutch I use when I am feeling weak or unfocused, I use it to draw me back in.

300.0,"The last time YouTube recommended your channel to me was probably 8 years ago.  I learned how to download YouTube videos because of your channel.  I was too young to have a girlfriend and didn't go to adult websites or couldn't rather.  They were blocked at my and my friends house but YouTube wasn't.  You used to wear the tightest yoga pants.  Those videos were hot.  Laying on your back with a big thigh gap, you had the best camel toe and mound on YouTube.  That sounds creepy, I know, but I'm just keeping it real.  I haven't watched any of your videos since those days but I'm betting you've toned it down, which that is too bad.  Especially now that camera and video quality has improved so much since then.  I wonder why YouTube recommended this video.  That was way outta the blue.  I don't watch videos like this at all but if you had all your curves showing in HD then I'd definitely watch that with my girlfriend!  She's always got that thigh gap going when she wants something or when she wants me to get jealous which she does really well, kinda scary.  But anyhow, I honestly wish I had time to check out the channel, see how it's progressed.

Even though practice was a little longer (not a complaint just pointing out it didn't feel like it), and I twisted my body into various shapes none of it felt forced or hurried.  It's very rare we get to savor things.  Everything is rush, rush, rush these days or we go places just to take pictures (I'm as guilty as anyone).  It's definitely time to put the phone or tablet or expectations or worry about getting to the next thing away, and just breathe and enjoy the moment.

I started the 30 day challenge as a commitment to myself and promised myself i'd see it through and i am so glad that i did because so far I am loving it and it lift me up.  Now my Narcissistic mother who judges everything I do and everything that I am, told me yesterday that she forbids me from doing yoga and threatened to trow away all my yoga equipments aways  (things that i bought myself with my own money I may add) she claimed that i am selfish and only live in my own world focusing on myself and that i am always adapting those ""stupid and useless habits"" thing is my social life is nonexistent since i am force to raise my 2 little siblings and taking care of the house.  Most of my time and energy is spent on the house and whenever i do something for me she gets mad and calls me selfish. I'm in college and due to financial limitation i am still living with my parents and it's driving me out of my scull everything i do they find fault in and always find a way to critique me. Aside from yoga what keeps me going is the conviction that things will change one day and I will truly be happy and surrounded by people who love and accept me for me.

641.0,"I feel so awful and defective and I hate that a practice called ""savor"" has left me in this place wanting to abandon over a year of daily yoga because is it not for my body. Pigeon always puts me in an awful place - the pigeon practice is easily a 5-10 minute sequence (i.e. a huge portion of the video) and I cannot do it. It causes me knee pain within 12 hours or so that lasts for days. No one has been able to help and tell me why or how to not make it happen. 18 days in this month and I feel less capable than ever.
