Just as I have been changing things up a little each day to carry us to the next, on day thirty, we will continue to turn things on their side once again.‚Ä®Yoga is a discipline, a training for a meaningful life.¬†
An opportunity to know and understand your self.
Today you are going to choose your moves.¬†
Choose your quality of breath¬†
without my vocal guidance,¬†
but with my undying ever present and unshakable support.
We have come a long way.
I am not going to downplay it‚Ä¶
This is a big and beautiful deal.
Meet yourself here. Day 30.

Anyhow, I started crying when Adriene said she'd take off the mic and that today's practice involved me choosing what to do. I realized choosing and being responsible for my actions is one of my fears. I was/am dependent on following orders because I didn't want to be accountable for my own decisions. I thank Adriene for teaching me through this journey to whisper affirmations for myself because I kept telling myself 'I am capable of choosing', 'I am strong', 'Trust your decisions, self'.

67.0,The first time that I ever completed a full 30 days of yoga after having tried several times before. Admittedly it took nearly two months to do it (I like to lie in bed next to my wife at the weekends!).  I have noticed how I am stronger because of this 30 days. both physically and mentally. I have engaged with the programme and tried to focus on what I want to move closer to ( for me it‚Äôs being a better husband and father).

91.0,"I began this challenge fairly late. I only started at the end of January, and I honestly felt quite strange to just follow this with such delay. However, I have been wanting to start doing yoga for a while now, and it finally seemed like the right time for me. 
Generally, I have been very self-conscious about my level of fitness and my ability to do physical exercise for probably eight years now (currently I'm 21). Although I have tried lots of different types of sport over the years, nothing really stuck, and nothing was able to make me feel good for a longer period of time. 
With yoga, I hoped that it would be different. That it could be something I can do just because it made me feel good. Without pressuring myself to excellent at it, without doing it to become skinnier, without doing it with any other motivation than to be kind to myself. Kind to my body, my heart, and my mind. And honestly, it did not work like that every single day. Sometimes I lacked motivation, sometimes I really was not mentally able to challenge myself the way I wished I would have. But that's okay. Because I have showed up every single day, for 30 days in a row. And even after the practices where I did not feel able to give it my all, I still felt good about myself for doing it. My body has been feeling better than it has for a long, long time, and my mind has become a lot more peaceful. And I am just incredibly happy and proud to have followed this practice.

This year however, I got so lost in my breathe combined with my tendency to practice with my eyes closed that when I peeked at the video to see Adriene in shavasana I was shocked (I even paused the video to sneak in a couple more things). I did my first challenge when I was 17, desperately trying to get the perfect body & hoping yoga would get me there. I was always shocked that it never felt like other workouts I had done, I never wanted to quit half way through or cheat a little. And now at 22 I realize that's because it's not work, it's love.

204.0,"I cried at the beginning because I am in an emotional place and at the end because of all the gratitude Adriene showed in her face and for being so proud of myself for making it through this journey and growing stronger!

I have been practicing with Adriene since she started, and back then I started experiencing debilitating symptoms from a chronic illness, she has had my back throughout the whole journey of diagnosis and times when I could barely move at all but I would show up on the mat.

I would ""go off the rails"" and do my own thing or lay in child's pose while the videos contributed until I could pick myself up again to rejoin. This journey, I've been recovering and starting to get my life back after 10 years of chronic pain. I am learning how to manage it better and Adriene has helped me extend love to myself this whole journey. This 30 days, she taught me that I actually am strong.

I used to skip planks because I was in too much pain but, I've slowly built myself and added planks and ab work during this video all on my own!

Thank you Adriene for holding space for us, for helping us grow strong and giving us tools for on and off the mat!

I had Adriene's voice in my head telling me, ""You got this! One more cycle of breath"", ""Whisper to yourself, 'I am strong'"", ""How you move matters"" and more.

You are so incredible and I cried with gratitude at the end for your generosity and kindness. As well as for how far I have come in my healing journey, with Adriene alongside me üíñ",UgxM8LhnmFMxk2N7qGp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-17T21:01:51Z,0.9995424747467041

I participated and completed Breath last year and it was so beautiful, and I was just coming out of a really hard time in my life, so it was very emotional to complete those thirty days. Now I am here, a year later, and I am still feeling emotional after completing this challenge too. We've all grown and changed so much, even without us realizing it. I take the tools I learn in yoga off the mat and into my everyday life. I've discovered so many new things within the last year; hell, within the last month!

I'm so proud of everyone who took part in this challenge. You are so strong. I'm so proud. No matter when or where in your life you are doing this challenge, you are here for a reason. I love you ‚ù§

I'm so happy that you do these things, Adriene. You really are a one of a kind soul. Thank you so much for helping me and teaching me, and continuing to do so. I am very glad God guided me here.

Thank you so much, Adriene and Benji, for being here too. For helping me recognise my strength.

But for some reason I just broke in tears in several parts of the practice. I think just having Adriene by my side even in silence was like a reminder that we are all a community and we're all by each other sides in this yoga practice, even if we don't speak.

415.0,"I needed a few days to collect my thoughts and express my deep feelings about this month as well as about the last day of practice in January. Last year I participated on the ‚Äúbreath‚Äù journey and I still vividly remember the whole month of me practicing. I remember skipping days, trying to get it over with and I remember the last day, when I got annoyed and irritated at not knowing which pose you were doing and failing to do the flow in sync with you. A lot has changed this year, as I set myself the intention of doing yoga every day for 365 days. This whole month I surprised myself every day by showing up regularly and turning this yoga ritual into a daily act of love towards myself. As an empath and a person that has been struggling with setting up boundaries and protecting my own peace, yoga has brought me to a place of patience and has created a new space for me, in which i get to protect myself from energy that isn‚Äôt mine and tune into my own pure energy that is within me and move with it throughout my day. Day 30 was very beautiful and emotional for me. I‚Äôve never been the type that lets out emotions easily, but with this practice I felt my emotions all over the place. I felt gratitude towards myself for creating my own ‚Äúlove cave‚Äù with candles, crystals and incence and gratitude towards adriene for sharing her wisdom and her presence with me. This time I knew I could trust my intuition and move in ways that felt good and connecting with her movements later and knowing that it was all okay.

I literally was just looking for one yoga practice in the beginning of this year, and saw that a 30 day series just had started, so I got exited to try it out:) I struggled quite a lot in the beginning to show up, and as I normally do: I was tempted  to set the bar too high. To expect from myself to keep this up for 100 days, maybe even a year. I thought to myself that maybe now I would gain back my flexibility. But I forced myself to take it one day at a time and just focus on that day, and I believe that is exactly why I made it to the end. And everyday it felt easier and easier to come back, even when I didn‚Äôt feel like it. I adore Adrienne as a teacher and I‚Äôm so so thankful to her for making this at this exact time!

496.0,"Just finished it now. I'm speechless, and even teared up a bit, ngl ü§ßüß°

I started few days late, first because of finishing my uni semester, but also because I didn't really know Adriene's series. (I'm a newbie!)

 I'm 21, always up for new things, challenges and plans; so for new years I decided I was going to add yoga into my life.
I've been meditating since 2019, but last year I took it seriously and I thought yoga would complement it perfectly. I wasn't wrong. 
I go to the gym regularly as I can't imagine myself w/o sport, but never went to try yoga; I was a bit skeptical about it, for some reason.
I'm glad I decided to give it a try: and this community rocks!!! 
I can't believe I managed to know which moves to do according to what my body and breath WANTED. It was like a rythmical dance. 

Thank you so much for this opportunity, i'm def sticking. (Rn reading some yoga books) Namast√© üßòüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôèüèºüå±

I cried throughout the practice, noting how my body has changed and grown and lost and found itself again. It was especially moving to hear last year‚Äôs ‚ÄúBreathe‚Äù music threaded through today‚Äôs soundtrack. A reminder that nothing beautiful is ever really lost or gone or over. It simply continues, as Thich Nhat Hahn would say, in a different form. May whatever the rest of this year and the 2023 challenge reveal the merits of this year‚Äôs practice in the same way that today‚Äôs final practice stood on the shoulders of the ones that came before it. For all of us. May nothing here be wasted, even the moments of pain and heartbreak; may all of it be honored; may all of it form and inform the ground for what is to come.

628.0,"Hi Adriene, I just finished my Day 30. As usual, every day 30 is always emotional. It marks the end of another series, and at the same time, it marks the beginning of another year, another small accomplishment, another mark of sincerity towards the self. I had found you During True, back in 2018, when I had just resigned from a job I was unhappy in. And since then, throughout the years, I completed all your January 30 days series. I have found growth, health, healing, self-love in these practices. I found that showing up here regularly for my self made me better at showing up for others in my life as well. I learnt to slow down, I realised it‚Äôs okay to take time. I learnt to breathe better. 
Thank you for making this throughout these years. For being a safe space where I can turn to in times of uncertainty. Thank you for putting a yoga out there for every situation in life. Oh I am sad, yoga for when you are sad. Oh I don‚Äôt want to get up from the couch, yoga for the couch potato. You are, this channel is, these practices are such a big part of my life. I, who is, in India. Will never meet you but will always remember you for having my back. For giving me something that changed my perspective to life.
Sorry, got a little emotional there. 5th year of beginning a year with you. Looking forward to the end of the year, however sad it may be, but there will be a new series and something to look forward to. That‚Äôs like a hope. Me and my sister, always talking about oh, God knows what will happen in the next year but hey, there‚Äôs going to be a new 30 days series. It‚Äôs personal.
Take care, and take so much love. If you actually manage to read this long gibberish of thoughts, know that I thank you always.",UgztB06LNFRLRcrtPiJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-06T12:16:27Z,0.9954569339752197

635.0,"Thank you so much Adriene for guiding us on this journey. I have a technical suggestion for the videos, if I may. And I hope I can explain it. So... When I join the routine, I place my mat parallel to yours, I think many are doing the same. So when sitting, you face us and we face you. Like standing in front of a mirror. And when you turn right and get on all four, we turn left and get on all four. From then on, until we sit and face each other again, your top of the mat is your right and our top of the mat is our left. When you start doing the poses, sometimes your first side is the camera side, and since we mirror you, our first side is then facing the opposite wall where we don't see you but hear you. Nothing wrong with that, just that I need to turn my head and peek quite often. And when it's time for your second side, where you face your window, this is when we can face your way and do the pose by actually seeing you. It's not always the case, sometimes you begin facing the window. But here is my suggestion. Especially when we try a new pose, if you start with your second side, that is, doing the pose looking at the window, it will then be time for us to do the first side facing you. So we get to see where the motion is going without turning our heads and peek. And then when it is your second side, you then look at the camera, and this time, although we look at our back walls, we now know what to do as we just completed the first side by looking at you. It is just a switch of your sides, and we can start the poses by looking at your way and learning them. I may sound silly, but that's what I thought in those peeking moments all along the way.

I was unable to bring myself to the mat for over a year until this challenge. Bringing myself back to the mat this month has brought me back to my body and I've had to confront what damage and setbacks were caused emotionally and physically, but this was the most consistent 30 days I have ever done, I always completed it in the past but usually with multiple delayed or doubled up days. This month I only delayed two days, a best for me by far. On day 30 during knocking on heavens door I started sobbing, a release, but I kept going. I still have far to go but I have made so much  progress. Thank you YWA.",UgzWztSLPgbrP34rOOp4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-02-05T17:39:17Z,0.9916343688964844

No plans, no premeditation.  And when I did look up, she was there, in a different position but right alongside me, friends practicing in tandem.  This was a revelation both for my own understanding of how deep my own vocabulary now goes, and also for how strong the connection is between humans when we breathe deep into ourselves, and together.

On a day like today I wanted security and something familiar to make me feel safe inside myself. But I told myself; when you're afraid, move. Movement changes energy and even though I started scared I ended up doing the movements that my body needed and somehow I remembered all of Adriene's practises and I kept breathing. At the end of this practise I felt more secure within myself and this is an important lesson I think for many of us, trust yourself and trust the process. That what you need is already within you. You can give yourself a safe haven, have faith in who you are. You are worth it, and so am I.

I was able to practice my resilience and compassion for myself throughout each day I stepped on and off the mat. I feel that this has helped me move closer to myself, which was exactly what i'd hoped for. I love the connection I feel to my body, and how much stronger I feel physically and mentally. This practice in particular was perfect for the rough day I had. I struggle with a tic disorder that sends me into full body convulsions where I have absolutely no control over my movement. These practices mean more to me than I could ever explain. I love coming back to my body as I gain control and nurture myself. It is a beautiful way to once again connect to my whole being. I wasn't able to do day 30 on day 30, but i'm grateful to have been able to do it today. Everything happens for a reason. I trust myself and the process, and I'm so grateful for that.

888.0,"Thank you so much for these 30 days and beyond, Adriene and team! One big thing I learned from MOVE was that balancing poses get me out of my thinking mind and into my body and breath like no others. In warriors, down dog, etc I can lose my breath or sort of slam into poses easily if I am not feeling so present. With balancing poses it is such a delightful challenge and I find myself noticing my muscles, how I stabilize when I find strength in my core or activated that inner thigh. And if my mind wanders and I lose focus, I fall, which is a beautiful reminder to return to the body and breath.

Every year, I realize I came up with excuses for why it wasn't the right time of day, the right atmosphere, I wasn't in the right mood, etc. This year, I never once had a day where I wasn't looking forward to my yoga time. This was the easiest time I've ever had completing it, and now I truly can't imagine regularly practicing yoga. I feel strong, I feel empowered, I feel intuitive, I feel MOVED. What a powerful thing this practice, this community, this movement is. I am so thankful to be a part of it. Congrats to all of you who joined the challenge, whether for 1 day, 10 days, or 30!

Many times during the month I hit spots of crying, sometimes from old trauma, sometimes learning to trust myself in body strength again. I am so grateful for your teaching, your being. You make a living and also give it away. This is right action. In the last week I have been wondering how my journey will move forward without the structure of the 30 day Challenge. I am both now, more confident to move and listen to my body and also realize I have much to learn and more to grow. With that knowledge and some poking around learn how to continue with you. I'm looking forward to a life of good choices for myself and developing the skill of amazing self-care which has eluded me most of my life.

Y'all betta be proud of yourselves, I know I am.

This was the first time I've not been nervous about flying solo during a yoga session. I trusted myself and went with the flow, peaking at Adriene every once and a while, and before I knew it, the practice was over! How liberating! 

Additionally, I stayed on track with this journey and completed it with the intention to be consistent. No stress, no push, just being present and having fun - bliss.

Adriene, as always, thank you for your service.

Since following you for five years, you have made yoga accessible for my mind, body and soul. Thanks to your work, my posture is so much better, and I have significantly reduced back pain, but most of all, I've learned to love myself by being patient and compassionate. Every year, I look forward to my January yoga journey, and this one was brilliant.

I wish everyone in this beautiful community a rewarding New Year.

1223.0,"Today I was quite surprised as to what we were doing. I remember seeing a comment on one of the videos a couple days ago saying that us ""newbies"" would not see this coming, and I sure didn't! That being said, I was truly amazed with how I did! I still struggle with how far I've come with this. Day 1 of Move randomly popped up on my yt feed when I needed it most. I was depressed, hating myself, and wondering what I could do to feel better both physically and mentally. I was also born with severely clubbed feet (meaning they turn in quite a bit) and even though I had surgery, I was lazy at the time and chose not to do the therapy exercises, and as a result, regressed tremendously. This has helped me get flexibility in my ankles that I never had before! That being said, from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much, to Adriene, to Benji, and to everyone else who has taken this journey. This is just the beginning! You are strong, and you are worthy!

It was my first time doing a 30 day challenge. I have been doing sporadic Yoga practices with Adriene for years, but I had never done 30 consecutive days, and to have succeeded, to have been constant, it makes me really proud.¬†

I just came back from a year of debilitating chronic pain. A few days before January 1, I was struggling to walk. And there, I just completed 30 days of yoga in a row in addition to 10 min of stationary bike per day. I can't believe it! So so proud!¬†

It made a big difference in my pain, which has greatly reduced. My mental health is also better. I am truly grateful! I also loved reading the community comments here after each practice.

But... I don't want to stop now!

1292.0,"I shed tears on every final journey day and today was no different. This is my fourth year doing a journey each January along with my commitment and gift to myself to complete a daily practice throughout the year. It has been the greatest gift of my life to do this.

I am going to redo this journey immediately on a larger screen, as have been travelling all of January and yoga on a phone while a gift in technology, is also a little small to focus on but it did allow me to do more of each session with my eyes closed. I must say that I had the chance to do yoga in places like the side of a mountain between snow gum trees, on a balcony at one of Australia's highest elevations under the moon, over looking a lake, in a tin shed in a flood, in a paddock as the sun was setting, in a showground under the hot sun, in a log cabin in an area decimated by bushfires 2 years ago, and in a campground under billions of stars when I got ambushed by a rogue possum launching at me in the dark! eek. I will NEVER forget this wonderful journey.

Adriene, I could never thank you enough for what you have given me and everyone else in the community. I feel like reading the comments and crying at a good portion of them too is just as nourishing as the yoga we are all doing.
Thank you everyone for sharing yourself and your stories, it's the most precious thing to be a part of. This is real community, something we ALL need.

This was a beautiful, and powerful journey that ended gloriously. CHOOSE, so empowering. I began seated with you to bless the practice. I began slowly, and about 6 minutes in, we were both extending left leg, right arm, and contracting...it trip me out when I instinctively turned my head to see us in sync. Gradually the dancer in me took over, and my mind was out the game. It felt so liberating, and the music was just the right flow. Ok, now its time to creates some magic!

I shared with him that I appreciated the way that I always left the mat feeling a little different than I did when I arrived. I shared that some days when I'm out and about I notice my core flexing, and that connection to core somehow reminds me more of my emotional and mental strength instead of my physical strength. I told him that even when I cannot see what yoga has taught me, I feel a vivid presence of something new. Something good. Ultimately I think that goodness is me. I'm finding me. I love myself...even when I don't think that, I show up to the mat, which means I love myself.

To Adriene, to this community, to myself. I showed up every single time this month and had the most beautiful flow - all guided by inner knowledge and letting my body ""tell"" me what to do. There were even a couple of times where I opened my eyes or looked at the screen and Adriene and I had a move that was in sync - it was incredible. And she was right, as I wound down, as did she and at the very end of practice, as I sat in cross-legged seat, a tear was brought to my eye. I could feel the vibrations and energy of being in sync with all of you and so many others around the globe. It was overwhelming in the best possible way. When Adriene said we'd be guiding ourselves, I recorded today's practice (which I haven't done all month) and I'm so glad I was able to harness a little bit of the magic that I experienced today.

The last day is always filled with an overwhelming mixture of accomplishment and deep love and acceptance for myself and others. This year I reflected on how much I've changed since last year and how loss creates space for unexpected gifts.¬†

During last year's practice, I was coming out of a particularly bad episode of depression and focused on regrowing my sense of self-love and promoting healing. This year, I am mentally stronger but struggled physically as I came down with COVID on the 3rd day of practice. I still managed to come to the mat everyday, with some modifications and patience with myself.¬†

This year was particularly special for me as it was the first time I trusted myself to listen to my mind and body and ""find what feels good,"" instead of sneaking peeks at the video to follow along with Adriene. Today I am grateful for change and growth. For self-love and self-trust. For beautiful moments with friends and family.

1527.0,"One thing I have noticed about Adriene is the peaceful exuberance she exudes during practice. The way she smiles, breathes, and carries herself from one motion to the next reflected a quiet strength I was determined to follow. So I embarked on this 30 day journey.

I am beyond joyful to announce that I have found this peaceful exuberance. Through healthy eating, meditation, yoga, and journalling, I have found an overflowing fountain of joy within me. This practice and this community has been instrumental to this wonderful transformation of love. It is not always easy. It is quite difficult at times, to make the active choice to turn to discipline and mindfulness, even knowing the joy it will result in. But I remind myself of an affirmation I thought of, one that I would like to share with you.

""Happiness can be found in attending each present moment with mindfullness and openheartedness. This is a task one must tend their entire life to - however, it is the process, not the destination, that bears fruit to our existence.""

Adriene had an extra amount of softness and love today that really touched me deep. I couldn't believe how much her music resonated with me and feelings of joy from yoga. 
I started and finished this sessions with a few tears. I haven't ever completed a challenge, nor stuck to anything for 30 days straight.
I yoga'd through tears and intense pain from my period. I yoga'd through my dogs severe illness. I yoga'd through tough days, sad days, sickness, happy days, over the moon days. I missed a day due to a stomach bug, but made up for it the following days. 

Here's to another 30 <3 

My breath is my anchor. My anchor is my breath.
You're Strong.

This time I was able to stick with the practice, and what a wonderful experience!  At the start of today's session I was a bit leary of the idea of not being led through the moves, yet I took a breath and started with an open mind. At first I kept peeking over at Adriene to follow what she was doing, and then I felt myself take the reins and truly move into what feels good. Still occasionally keeping an eye on what was happening on the screen, I would find a smile when I had just finished a variation of pose and then saw Adriene flowing into the same shape. At one moment I burst out laughing with joy when I realized how much stronger I was after 30 days of this practice, and cried at another.  The emotions took me by surprise. This is such a heartfelt loving practice and kind, supportive community.

Thank you so much for guiding us with your love, laughter and care over this past month. 
I knew I had made the right commitment when in the early days we were in total sync, not in yoga but in squirrels!  You had just looked out the window, saw a squirrel and commented while at that EXACT moment, I too had been looking out my window and saw a squirrel!  I had a good laugh that day!  
We were also in sync today during our last days' practice.  At one point,  I looked up at the screen and we were in the EXACT same position in movement!  There is no such thing as coincidence and I know 100% that I was guided to find your teachings and be here this month.  
In 30 days I grew stronger, braver, more peaceful and even proud of myself for showing up every day.  To be honest, there were one or two days that I wasn't sure I had the energy yet I came to the mat and once there didn't look back.    
I will be continuing our journey together in practice and look forward to where we'll go.  One day at a time.

But today, after taking one final loving breath in, gratefulness engulfed me and filled me with ecstacy, and I couldn't have felt more proud of myself for showing up, no.matter.what.
The love, the discipline, the mindfulness of being present at the moment and savoring each moment I have - are the values we will carry forward with us.
I move with discipline, with strength, with care.
I am moving towards a better self.
I am moving with my breath, which will remain to be my foremost priority.

Inhale lots of love in,
Exhale lots of love out
And here begins our journey further

1683.0,"Thank you so much for this month's practices! This is the first time I've done all 30 days in a row, I'm so proud of myself! January's playlist was such a helpful tool for recovery and a tremendous source of positivity as this is my first month on my own since completing therapy. I used to experience severely unhealthy amounts of anxiety, stress and depression to the point I would ""paralyze"" myself and not be able to really do anything without harming myself emotionally. I couldn't even bring myself to do yoga anymore (or any other hobby) out of fear and anger that I wasn't being productive and I shouldn't be enjoying anything because I didn't deserve it. I'm forever grateful to your dedication in these videos & to your belief in the healing powers of yoga.

Initially the ""no mic"" freaked me out but your mantra find what feels good popped into my head. I kept asking myself ""what do I want to do"" until I started finding a good focused flow. It made me tear up a bit because I don't always pay attention to what I want & it creates a negative mindset. Thank you again and look forward to doing another month of yoga!

1694.0,"(this is gonna be long, but it turns out I have a lot to say haha)

Adriene, 
I've been doing yoga with you off and on since college. I say off and on because there were some months when I could hardly get myself out of bed, let alone to the mat. I remember at the end of 2017, when I was getting ready for my first semester of grad school and you were getting ready for True. I had just finished the new beginnings video, thinking to myself ""huh. I could do that."" I gave it a go but couldn't get myself to stick with it daily, so I gave up; what's the point if I won't make it every day? What can I get out of it if I'm not doing it right? So I cycled through your other videos and left True on the back burner.

Then it's the end of 2018, and you announce Dedicate. I'm in a better place mentally since getting on medication, and I think to myself ""this is my chance! I'll get it right this time!"" So I set my alarm, because at that point morning practices before work suited me best, and got on the mat. I was more consistent this time, but I still couldn't quite make it through. Disappointed in myself, I once again set it aside and cycled through your other videos.

Fast forward to the end of 2019. I'm looking forward to 2020 and to Home, just like everyone else -- it's gonna be my last year of grad school, and even though school is my main stressor, I'm excited to write my thesis. I'd also gotten a new job at that point, and spent the first two months convinced I was going to get fired before getting moved to a new department. I had a mostly stable routine and thought I'd finally get through it this year (spoiler alert: I didn't). I got further along than previous years, but still not on time.

March 2020 didn't really change much for me; I was an essential worker and my classes were already online, so I carried on as normal. But I went back to Home with a new sense of determination. Even if I didn't do it every day, I was damn well going to finish it out.

And I did! It took longer than 30 days, but I did it. I felt ""at home"" in my body and was inspired and decided to work backwards -- I would tackle Dedicate next, and then go back to True. By July I hadn't quite finished, but I wanted to give Revolution a try, so I set my sights on that 31 day yoga journey and left the rest of True (and uncovering my ""true self"") for August.

From there I hopped around the playlist of yoga sequences I'd made from my favorite of your and Sarah Beth Yoga's videos. I still struggled a lot with consistency, but I knew that yoga made me feel good, and at that point it had become a keystone habit for me. (Also, I'd apparently lost 30 pounds -- who knew! My sister teases me for ""stretching"" as a workout, but I sure showed her!)

Then Breath came along last year, and even though I was annoyed that it wasn't called Breathe, I was still committed to seeing it through. I was kinder to myself this time around; I knew that even if I didn't get through it live, I would still finish it out. And in February, I did. Another March came around, and I decided to work backwards like I had before: Home, Dedicate, True, and Revolution, straight through. I mixed in other videos, tried new routines each week to keep myself going, but I could feel myself slipping; I was gaining weight again, I didn't like the way I felt in my body, I was regressing in my mental health. But I recommitted -- got myself into a new routine of yoga after work, followed along as best I could with your playlists for the remaining months of the year. 

And then came Move.

What did I want to move closer to? Much like with Home and True, I chose myself. I wanted to like myself -- not even love, because I knew that that was a long shot, but I could at least do that.
I checked the calendar (mostly 20 to 30 minute videos, totally doable!) signed up for the emails, and got ready.

And today, January 31st 2022, I completed the journey along with you.

I've read comments from people who cried doing your videos, and while I've definitely teared up, today was the first day that those tears actually fell. I had felt myself getting stronger with each practice, and today I was going to prove it and honor that strength.

I came up with a little prayer/mantra to whisper to myself throughout today's practice, one that you helped me to find the words for: ""I am grateful for my body, for it has carried me through these 30 days. I love my body, for it has carried me through these 30 days. I choose my body, for it has carried me through these 30 days. I am my body; I have carried through these 30 days."" Sat for the first few minutes of practice crying and repeating that to myself, and then I dove in and did my own thing. A couple times I looked up and you were doing the same thing, which warmed my heart. I wasn't alone; I had you.

I finished today with my mantra, and I will try to start each day moving forward with it, too. That's my word of the year, ""try"" -- to do better, to be kinder. I tried this month with Move, and I'm very proud to say that I've succeeded. I'm so full right now that it's taken me over an hour to get all these words out, but I did it. I did it.

I did some planks, some downward dogs, warrior 1, warrior 2, peaceful warrior, mountain pose, side planks, cobra, upward facing dog, boat, tree pose, eagle hands, dancer, and some focused core stuff that I don't know the name of. 

I wore myself out. But I did it. And while I definitely forgot a lot of the stuff I can do (or work toward) when Adrienne is guiding me, I do know a lot more now than I did 30 days ago.

This was a wonderful journey. I missed a few. And that's okay. Most of the time I showed up. I practiced. I learned.

1723.0,"Yesterday something terrible happened that left me unstable in lots of mental pain.  I mean,  im still in relatively good health, nobody died, and i still have a home, so i guess it is not that bad.  But this event was unjust, unpedictable and sent me spiraling to a very sinister place. Today i woke up feeling no difference. Everything was awful. Finally when i got into bed i reached for my gratitude journal, deciding i will write that i'm thankful for food, sunrays falling through the window and my bed - you know,  stuff to be thankful for on one of those Bad Days. But then i realised: i didn't do my yoga today! Every day i write that im thankful for my ""n""th day of yoga, which gives me small dopamine hits whenever i see my progress. Well, if i'm on over 50 days long streak of daily yoga practice, i can't fail today, even if i feel like shit and existing feels like punishment. So on 02:39AM i got on the mat and started stretching. I must admit i was mostly observing and following Adriene, because in my current state deciding what feels good was almost impossible. Though I made some minor adjustments, hip stretches instead of downward dogs etc.

This year I finally realized that‚Äôs not the case‚Äîthis day is for me. And I really appreciated you reiterating that in the email because it helped make me feel safe. This practice actually ended sooner than I thought! So I went a few extra minutes to finish up a few moves I wanted to do.

1959.0,"Last year I was reluctant to skip a day even when it seemed impossible, this year since day 1 I told myself, you know what life happens keep going if you ever skip a day is fine you will learn from those days too. This is what I learned from the days I missed: 

Day 14 - Plan better my days. I knew that I had something to do at the time I usually practice yoga and still my life wasn't adjusted accordingly. 

Day  22 & 23 - Period days. Horrible days, ladies will get it. I listened to my body which is very important too. 

Day 25 - Life happens. Unexpected meetings at work delayed my day by 4 hours. 

I am still proud of myself. Thanks Adriene!!! This journeys are amazing I feel we are close friends.",Ugz6KAZvFty-0qiz0_Z4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-31T23:04:16Z,0.9987931251525879

2129.0,"Keeping myself accountable: Day 30!!!

At the start of the practice with the announcement of there not going to be any instruction, I panicked. But I quickly got into doing my own movements and following by breath, not long after I started getting lost, not naturally moving and seeking out instruction... I pushed on trying to get back into the flow and eventually I did. This somewhat represents my journey throught the whole practice. I was scared of failing yet again at the start, but then turning up became natural and fun thing only for it then to become difficult to find the time, energy or peace of mind to be fully emerged in the practice... Nearing the end of this challenge I again got into the fun and flow of showing up for practice. This is my third time trying the 30 day challenge, and third time lucky, I succeeded! I started the challenge with the goal of trying to see if i could keep myself accountable if i posted to the world whether i showed up, the fear of disappointing not just myself but others too was a great motivator but once I got into that end flow I realised I didnt need it anymore because I was truly capable of showing up and doing this for myself. 

I did it. I shed many tears throught the challenge at Adriene's kind words, especially the one about taking up space because we deserve to, but now I'm shedding tears because I am proud of being able to succeed in showing up for myself.

2203.0,"It's just been 7 years ago today that I started yoga with Adriene. I have been doing yoga pretty much every day ever since, slowly gaining so much control through the practice that it has had a great influence on my everyday life. It cultivated courage in me to show up and do movement exercises (I even started a bunch of other movement related practices that I never knew I would be able to do). I also learned how to pay attention to small things and, most importantly, how to be grateful for the body I have. I have recently been developing some physical symptoms of stress which has been keeping me away from my movement practice for quite a long time now. And again, I returned to this channel just like 7 years ago because in this pretty much collapsed state I knew Adriene's yoga practice is something that is simply just so kind and gentle. And today after 2 months besides doing Day 30 I was also back on the yoga mat at my local yoga class :)",UgzywWNiRA2IH4gGg5F4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-31T20:43:25Z,0.990523636341095

2265.0,"Thank you so much for sharing this journey with us, Adriene!

Todays practice was great, just like all the others! I peeked at your moves and took inspiration, heard your reminders ringing in my ears at times (like 'take the deepest breath you took today', 'move with your breath' or  'move from the core'), yet managed to modularly create my own flow! I went off the rails and adapted the flow as I saw fit, doing the moves I learned and preferred at that moment. I learned to move on my own, to flow, to challenge myself and my body - which I did rarely before practicing yoga with your guidance.

This is the first of your challenges I partook in, and I loved the experience. I didn't make it on one of the 30 days, but I continued with one day delay and caught up on a relaxing practice and did two on that day to be in sync again - I count that as a win :D
With irregularly doing 2-5 practices a week (mostly with your videos) last year and this challenge I feel like I do have everything I need to take it to the mat daily, even completely on my own if need be - but otherwise, I know one of your practices will be there to give me guidance!
I am looking forward to all the many practices you will share with us in the future, and have shared with us in the past that I haven't discovered yet, or will repeat again many times :)
See you on the mat tomorrow.

2318.0,"Last year was my first year doing this, and when it came to day 30 I was too uncomfortable directing my own practice.  I let that discomfort overwhelm me.  This year I came in with an open mind and tried, and made it 17 minutes!  I would have loved to have felt even more present and comforted, but I am acknowledging that growth.

The entire experience this year has been transformative as I no longer identify with feeling like someone who doesn't know what they're doing.  It's much more of a practice now, and a part of my being.  

Thank you Adriene and team for nurturing me and so many, bringing us along on this journey of self discovery, teaching us how to set and define our own boundaries.  I have a lot more room for growing into my practice, but as of this moment, I find peace with what is.

Spontaneity is something really far from me, just like sitting down and paying attention to my feelings or momentary needs, so at first I got a little panicky even though Adriene said we can freely follow what she does. My first thoughts were something like 'I don't know what could I do without guidance, I can't come up with any yoga poses' although I've been practicing for years now. These thoughts started to gather in my brain but before I realized it my moves followed each other.

Also, let me say this Adriene, watching you moving with so much grace, control, and strength, noticing here and there those micromovements of yours, that truly inspired me, maybe more than anything else, in continuing this journey. At times I almost felt like I shouldn't be there, watching something so pure and personal like you doing your practice. It was so special and truly an honor to witness, the ultimate gift from you to all of us going through this path hand in hand with you. Finally, I realized it was never about reaching day 30, but this is all about coming back here on days 31, 32, 33... having the courage, the curiosity, the willingness, the power, and the discipline to do something joyful for ourselves, every single day, showing up on the mat with what we've got, to experience life and hopefully peace for the mind and body.

Adriene, thank you so much for taking us on and guiding us through these beautiful 30 days of finding what feels good and building a foundation to help us go further. When I started today's video I suddenly felt sentimental and when the intro came on I was sad that this was going to be the last day of this experience. You see, from the beginning of this year, I was looking forward to coming to the mat every single day in the evening to wind down and let go of the day. It has become part of my ritual and I deeply appreciate it. Even though I know that this specific journey is over, I too know that there is much more to come and we will continue practicing alongside. Thank you for a truly magnificent day 30 where you allowed us to practice freely which I initially thought I couldn't do but you definitely proved me wrong. I couldn't believe how fast it was over and it showed me that I can now practice much longer than I thought and even by myself.

2491.0,"Okay, so I started crying after literally 1 second of today's session. That's a new record, even for me, haha. 

This last year was tough. I had a burnout and was diagnosed with depression. I quit my old job and started therapy. I haven't moved much for most of 2021. I just didn't have the capacity. I decided to give it a try again. I had discovered YWA during that very first lockdown. But I was scared. Scared of ""failing"". And it was tough at first, getting back into movement. But I did. 30 consecutive days of yoga. I can't remember the last time I was so proud of myself.

I don't want to paint it prettier than it is. I'm still struggling. Therapy is hard. But I think I accomplished what I had promised myself to move towards on the very first day of this year's 30 days of yoga. I want to move (back) towards myself. Towards who I truly am. I managed to feel more in touch with myself again. To take better care of myself again. And this and even though it's just a milestone on what will still be a long journey, gives me hope. So much hope for the future. And that's incredible.

This year, I was a little bit excited to try it out on my own, a little more curious to see what I would find myself doing... a little more excited to do all my favorite moves... and to be honest... there were a few times I laughed out loud because I... well... I choose to do things that pushed my boundaries and I may or may not have fallen out of a pose or two... but because of this journey I've been on... I knew it was ok if I fell...

It's been a sweet journey, one I'm SO incredibly grateful for. 

Thank you Adriene for being willing to be so vulnerable and open/loving to such a large community... being vulnerable and open to loving people as they are is a trait I want to work on, process within, journey on, discover within me because of how your willingness to love and welcome has affected me... and I now want to extend that same grace and love to others.

2616.0,"I did it!!!!!  For the first time, even though I have journeyed with Adriene through six 30 day journeys!  The first time, I was so upset when I realised that there was no guided practice and stopped the video.  Each year since, I've not even started day 30.  Yesterday, two fellow yogis encouraged me to do it.  One suggested I write down a few ideas before I start.  Well, I didn't actually write anything down but decided that I would do some stretches, starting with extended neck hygiene, moving into twists and side stretches.  I stayed low to the ground, sometimes extending the stretch for a longer time.  I did get up to knock on heaven's door then went down into a yogic squat.  Somehow the time passed without my feeling stressed or anxious.  Never again will I miss a day 30!

Surprised again at how much I actually knew, and how comforting it was to have a 'friend' practicing alongside me in case I felt lost. We synced up at a few twists and poses, which was such a delightful surprise!

I'm amazed by how far I've come not just since last year, but even in the last 30 days. I am gentler with myself. I CHOOSE to do multiple planks today and even found myself whispering, ""I am strong"" unprompted. I also did a star pose, which I remember you saying in a previous video, ""you deserve to take up space"". Then I cried. I was nervous at the beginning, but am feeling empowered now. I am truly in awe of how much yoga has changed my life. Thank you, Adriene. I honestly have no idea where or who I would be without you & this channel.

am i the only one who's sad that this has ended? i mean, it became a habit, no matter how i felt, i showed up everyday and felt proud of myself for doing so. this has helped my mental health so much. 
i feel sad that today was the last day of move. anyhow, i have fallen in love with yoga because of ywa. learnt so much gratitude for something as simple as a mat, it got my back, seriously, both literally and metaphorically. adriene, you say that we are your heroes, acknowledge us for showing up; but in actuality, YOU are OUR hero, not all heroes wear capes, and you are one. 
taking with myself so much from these 30 days, including discipline. 
today's practice seemed uncertain to me but it helped to learn that i can trust myself. it gave me the motivation to show up on my mat every day for the rest of the year, sometimes with you, sometimes with my own breath and self. 'my breath is my anchor, my anchor is my breath'

2855.0,Thank you for this practice and for 30 days of mat time.  This might be the last time I can ask this question with live comments so I'm going to do it here and hope you or other knowledgeable people can help.  Breath is so important and often there are certain breathing techniques that go along with the practice.  I don't have air passage through my nose - never have.  In fact I have an exceedingly small nasal pathway that often time isn't open... so I find it hard to do the breathing as I have to breathe 95% of my air through my mouth.  Is there a type of breathe that can replace the breathing that is closed mouth and used often times in these practices. Obviously I do the best I can but keep wondering if there is a mouth breathing technique that would better support this practice if I can't breathe through my nose with my mouth closed.,UgxFEFra8oxLTiAv6tp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-31T15:14:43Z,-0.9881927371025085

3032.0,"Last year on day 30 was the only day I missed out, because that very day the police knocked on my door to tell me, my brother had died in a car crash. He was innocent, on his way home from a new job, when a teenager, who had gotten his drivers license only 14 days earlier, engaged in an illegal car race with a friend, lost control and crashed into my brother on the opposite lane. The wreck didn't even look like a car anymore. Supposedly, my brother was dead right away. I hope, that's true.  
Ironically, my other brother had died in an almost identical way already in 1985. Also on his way back from work, when a transporter crashed into him frontally, killing him. 

Last year, after that event, I didn't catch up on day 30 anymore, and hardly did any yoga the rest of the year either, although I love this channel for several years now. These past few years have been so hard, not only because of the pandemic. I went through a traumatic and failed surgery myself (ending up with PTSD from it), had my best friend dump me, lost ALL other friends and social connections, too, had my chronic depression get so much worse, had my mother get diagnosed with cancer (she had surgery now but refused the chemo therapy, which worries me although I respect her decision), and most of the time now I'm too scared to even leave my apartment. 

But this January I ""signed myself up"" for this challenge again and didn't miss a day. Not even day 30 now, where I've got a candle for my brother burning. That might not sound like a big thing, but for me in my current state it is. And I hope to go back to the discipline I used to have before and just stick with daily yoga again now, because in the past that was always incredibly helpful not only physically but especially mentally. 
These past 30 days of practice felt like an embrace in some way. For that, I want to say a big thank you to Adriene, for the love, passion and work that goes into these videos and lessons. You have no idea how much you help people like me. Thank you! ‚ù§üß°üíõüíöüíôüíú

Also body update: 
- I went from having weak arms that can't even handle short planks to I can do planks longer now! And that transition from downward facing dog to baby cobra, I can definitely do them with more control now!
- I can feel that my legs are definitely getting stronger as well. I remember that I struggled so much doing the warrior poses in day 1 (and until day 5-7 I think), but today, easy peasy! 
- I am definitely more flexible which resulted to my movements becoming softer.

I have never felt so connected to myself, to a community, to my life, to this planet, the collective, everything. I have found such a sense of belonging here. Belonging in myself, comfort in my own skin to be who I am, sensitive and so full of love. Even trying to type this comment, I keep getting tears in my eyes. (Happy ones) To everyone I have met along this journey, on the live chats especially, I am so grateful to you all for being here. I am grateful to be part of a community that is focusing on showing up for themselves. I strongly believe that through this practice of showing up for ourselves, we can show up so much more authentically and fully for others. But it all starts with oneself. Our strength, compassion, and love is a force of nature that this world desperately needs. Thank you for breathing with me. For accepting my love. For adding fuel to my light. For everything. Truly. 

30 DAYS! We did it!!! I am so beyond proud. Words truly cannot express this feeling in my heart and soul. 

To Adriene, Benji, the entire YWA & FWFG teams that make all this magic possible‚Ä¶ Thank you from the bottom of my heart and soul. Without you all, this world would be a dimmer place. 

To any that are sad that this is over, I won‚Äôt wish you not to be. I am a little sad myself as this month has been a chapter of my life that I will never forget. The new beginning. It‚Äôs okay to be sad. Just know, that the true journey is not over. This is one chapter of SO many more to come. To any that want to continue on with us live at the same time, I will kindly remind you that there is an app for that! The FWFG Kula app is entirely focused on the journey of Yoga for so many people. There are several of us that are wanting to continue our practice at the same time every day. 10am GMT. I truly hope to see you there. All are welcome. I look forward to continue to share energy with this collective and will still interact in the comments on videos that we practice. I hope everyone knows that they are loved. You are worthy of love and acceptance, I promise. 

All in all, I hope anyone seeing this knows this. YOU. ARE. NOT. ALONE. We have your back always. Adriene and Benji have your back always. Your mat has your back literally and always. I send you all so much love. See you tomorrow! ü•∞",Ugx2kRjo4BARaKt0pEB4AaABAg,2.0,3.0,2022-01-31T11:30:46Z,0.6341637741363829

3295.0,"left me longing for more. at the end of it i didn't even realize we were closing in on the practice, teared up a little.

i wonder what i will be choosing. in the beginning of this journey, i wished for better health, contentedness, and success. that hasn't changed. yet you tickled my brain with this word, choose, it's so powerful. we make choices every single day, every minute. but how many of these choices are mindful? it's simple, but with mindfulness in the equation, meaning adds up to every choice. what is the meaning behind this choice, is it beneficial, to whom, etc.? and why is it important to make? ok look, with my existential crisis that has not even aged 24 hours, i'm pondering over my life, no regrets though. and i'm also thinking about the ""choices"" we choose not to make. everything is a choice, choosing to choose and choosing not to choose. it's just that some hold higher significance than others. like choosing myself and prioritizing my needs, which are always met, without fail, every time i step on the mat. i love this kind of thing. i think, after having thought of things, i choose to go easy on myself, and that going easy does not equate to being lazy or anything of the sort (lazy is good tho, sometimes). with that, i hope my percpective's widened a little bit more on how i choose to achieve my wishes.

i am grateful. thank you adriene, as always. i missed cute benji on this one ü§ç my simba showed up as always, he's my little ball of sunshine üíõ

I hope the last day of this journey will be the beginning of a new habit and a love if yoga for you, as it was for me last year at this time. I went from spurts if yoga here and there  over the previous 20 years, to not missing even a  single day since De. 17th 2020, over a year and  2 mos now ago.  I started doing daily yoga after an invitation  to join last years Breath journey came in from a  FB friend. This morning I am about to complete this video and enjoy my 410th  day of consecutive yoga. My committment to myself for self-care is so strong now, that I wouldn't miss it  Adriene and the YWA community have changed my life in so many ways. My energy/hope for you, is that this has been an incredible journey that you just can't out down (like a good, life changing self- help book).

Thank you, Adriene. Words aren‚Äôt enough. 

This was the most healing, moving!!!! experience I‚Äôve ever had with Yoga, my body, my breath, with my mind. When I found out this challenge is called ‚Äúmove‚Äù I‚Äôve cried. I knew I was supposed to be here, I knew even months before that my year 2022 will be dedicated to movement. I understand what it means to move now and how much we have to show up, how much we have to just be there in order to move. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether we move the breath, whether we move our mind or our body. We are always moving and the more mindfully we are doing it, the more our moves will be closer to the truth of who we are. Moving forward, I did not think I would stick to Yoga the entire year, but here I am. Completely in love with it, with moving this way closer to myself. My sister joined too, we are going to continue. I moved with her and a community.  I found so much, but mostly important the trust, the strength, the compassion, the love for the process of moving.

It‚Äôs truly a blessing that it‚Äôs inclusive of anyone who wants to join in, not just those who can afford to. So grateful too to everyone in this wonderfully kind, validating and encouraging community. It feels like the best of humanity that gathers here and that seems rare these days, especially online! ü•∞

And what an amazing way to start the year! I‚Äôve only done Breath before, and I loved how nurturing it was with the combination of breath work and movement. With Move I noticed how my strength and resilience grew, both in body and mind. It was more athletic and physically challenging in some ways, but weirdly I actually found it easier to show up every day this year. I think knowing every practice was guaranteed to be under 30 mins made a big difference! It was easier practically to schedule into a daily routine, but also mentally more doable - no matter how crappy I was feeling I knew I could manage to last at least that long! It‚Äôd be great if any future series continued on with this üòä

This year I‚Äôve decided not to stop daily yoga practice here - planning to repeat Breath, starting tomorrow! And then hopefully work my way backwards through all the other 30 day series! Will anyone else be there? I hope so because I‚Äôll miss this feeling of communityüßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•∫

I had to skip two days and then managed to recuperate when I was on heavier meds but since then I couldn't do my favourite poses (any back twist). I had to modify, accept the frustration that came in knowing that my body wasn't supporting me and realise that I'm still grateful for all the other muscles that got stronger. All the poses that I did for the first time and did them right and easily were the combination of years of daily practice, of moving my body within its limit, without going too far but still growing stronger and more confident in my skin. I hated sports and wasn't flexible, I hated my body but yoga really helped me shift all this perspective. Thank you Adriene for being an amazing teacher of yoga and of life.

3520.0,"Dear Adriene,
I would like to thank you for not only introducing me to yoga, which has become the greatest passion of mine and improved my health significantly, but for the most special and important gift there is - the gift of life.

You literally saved me in all possible ways. There was a time when your soft guiding voice was the only dear sound to my ears and the only link between my inner cage of hopeless and endless pain and the external world - you were my bridge of life, my breath. I was in a super dark place back then, and you not only gave me tools to face it and coupe with it, but showed me the light in people, in me and taught me how I can bring it into my world and even make it my reality of each and every moment.

Apologies if it all sounds pretentious and has got much too much pathos, but that was exactly how the things stood - you are the reason why my eyes are open today - that‚Äôs the truth and I believe you deserve to know how much impact you really have on other people‚Äôs lives.

Bless you and be sure your first class place in Heaven is waiting for you ;)

With love,
Sveta from Moscow, Russia",UgyBe5Wp5XmFl4bxYy54AaABAg,2.0,4.0,2022-01-31T10:23:04Z,0.998964786529541

My gratitude knows no bounds! You've truly changed my life in the best way imaginable Adriene! I'm forever grateful to you for that!
Yes, today is the last day of the 'Move' journey but I will never forget your words that: 'in every end is a new beginning', thank you for all you've done for us, are doing and will continue to do!
Also, Adriene, double and triple thanks for your generous reminders to rest when we want to, breathe as we love ourselves, and trust!

Then I decided to get a new one thicker and larger, somewhat expensive, because I acknowledged this wasn't just a phase, I neither want nor will want to quit it. It boosted the yoga experience to another level. Don't hesitate to invest in something like that.
