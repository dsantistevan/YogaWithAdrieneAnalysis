1.0,I cannot thank you enough for the words you choose to use and the empathy you give to all of us. I woke up so anxious today and you made it possible for me to both move my body and get all my emotions out. I can't believe how much we really are in our heads for the moving our arms back and forth part but that really helped me shake so much of it out. I appreciate you more than words can say.

79.0,"I got Covid 10 days ago and it completely threw me off track since the symptoms rendered me unable to move much, much less do yoga but today even though it is almost 11 pm where I live and even though my day has been very unproductive so far and I haven't been great, I decided to get changed into my yoga clothes and try this out. Very conveniently, before I got sick I had stopped at Day 15 - Reset, I do not think it could have been more fitting if I had tried to time it! So today, I started my reset process, to claim my body and life back after Covid, by doing the Day 15 - Reset YWA video! Thank you Adrienne, this was just what I needed; it wasn't too hard on my body and it was short and sweet! I feel so much better now even though I am very behind and am doing the January challenge in February!

I did miss a few days in the beginning, but I have now caught up with those lessons. 
I am so thankful for Adriene and this journey! Starting with her every morning for the past week has really changed how I feel during the day. I feel so energised and loving to myself because of the loving things Adriene says during the practise. 
I answered her question: 'What do you want to move closer to?' with: my true self. I have been acting like someone else for a long time because I didn't accept my true self. But now I am learning that I am great the way I am and I want to stop hiding myself. At the beginning of the year I chose a word/intention for 2022: Bloom.
So I am trying to grow and bloom this year. After these 15 days I also want to grow in my yoga practice. So I have made a promise to myself to try and do yoga everyday for the next year! Next month I will be doing Adrienes 30 day challenge TRUE. Because I think it will accompany my journey towards my true self really well.
Thank you Adriene for all your work and loving energy you put into these practises! And thanks to all the wonderful people who also follow this journey, it feels amazing to do this journey with people from all over the world💕

328.0,"Something powerful happened to me during this practice. Today was not a great day and I slipped back into old behaviors that I don't want to be doing anymore. But despite that, I accessed some form of strength and acceptance today. I put up a fight I am proud of. And even though coming to the mat and slowing down meant being reminded of what didn't go so great today, I found myself with a dim smile on my face. I explored this smile and found an image of a mess of grey yarn, with a single, tiny, bright red string of color hidden in the mess, but unmistakabley present. This little string is my hope. It is the strength that I carry through adversity. And I'm glad I found it, because now I can start pulling on it and, I hope, bring some more color back into my life. For so long I've wondered how to get to the next level. How to keep chugging along when times are tough for what feels like so long. And today I have this tiny little spark. A message from above that says to keep it up, keep faith, focus on what's working, and have no doubt in what you know to be true. 
Im excited for what I may learn in another 15 days, but for now, I will see you all tomorrow. Namaste",UgyJbNYcQLboiHUx6a54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2022-01-17T05:32:48Z,0.989863395690918

I really hope so and that it heals quickly! Maybe modifications is the way to go. Or maybe to accept myself where I am now, rest, and get back to it when it's all healed up.

However, this year, fresh videos from the 30-day-yoga journey are released at 10 am (my local time) which is not so convenient to my daily routine, so I've embraced this as an opportunity to adjust and test new times to hop the mat daily. Quit is not an option. I am committed to this learning process. And the second most precious takeaway is definitely the journey, not the destination. Thank you!

I decided instead to just pick up where I left off, do the practice of the day, stay in the flow of our community, and just tack on the days I missed to the end of the month. Bam.

However, later in the morning I found myself to be in a really weird headspace and quite emotional, seemingly out of nowhere.

Then I saw the title of this practice was “Reset” and I felt I could not ignore that very obvious sign from the Universe. I’m glad I did it. I don’t know if I’m totally out of my funk, but I think in some way I do feel a little more peaceful, and I am very grateful for that.

599.0,"I really just wanted to email this to you and not make it public but everywhere says you don't look at emails. I have paid for series from you in the past, so I'm a paying supporter of you. 

 I have to say I'm deeply disappointed to see your fitted shirts don't come above a size 16. And no, relaxed/unisex boxy tees are not an ok alternative to make up for it. 

I do know exactly how difficult it is to find suppliers who do offer extended sizes in fitted shirts, and how they're more money etc. I just think for all your genderqueer / non binary / gender fluid / trans women / cis women / cis men who like fitted tees and fit larger sizes, it is important to say you see them by offering their sizes in the fitted tees. Especially in something connected to yoga where their bigger-than-size-16 bodies are marginalized and even reacted to with disgust and annoyance all. the. time. in yoga spaces. 

I know doing the work to offer this is a pain. I also know it's much worse to be the person trying to exist in a body that's ignored (like this example) and even rejected in spaces like yoga.

I woke late today, at 11:30, needing rest after doing most of the move yesterday. At 11:31, the school director called. One of my elementary students has tested positive. So cleaning the old apartment and moving the bed was delayed. Cleaned a bit more first and was tested after lunch. Rushed back to finish because I had to finish moving out quickly. Would have been awkward not doing so and stuck in quarantine. Let's hope for the best. Will know tomorrow.

783.0,"Ariene completely changed my life. This 30 day challenge makes me reflect on how far I've come. I started practicing Yoga with Adriene about 4 years ago, as a last resort, when I was suffering from extreme chronic pain. The pain and insomnia was so bad, I could barely leave my flat. Desperate for something to change I started showing up to the mat. About 6 months in I started to understand the power of yoga. During one of Adriene's class I was in child's pose and something cracked in me. A wave of intense emotion bubbled up to the surface and I cried and cried. Afterwards I noticed the physical pain felt just a little bit better. This set me on a path to find out more about yoga, chronic pain, and the mind-body connection. Now in 2022, still on my journey, my pain is 85% better, I fulfilled a dream of mine to become yoga teacher, and I have started my own business teaching people how to find relief from chronic pain and anxiety through yoga, meditation, and expressive writing. Thank you Adriene, I am eternally grateful to you and this community.",UgwwP1rxMkgSdYApZVx4AaABAg,14.0,346.0,2022-01-16T10:52:10Z,0.9948824644088745

I'm not sure I can do that while I still have to study things that I'm not interested in (at the university), so I loved that it was ""move closer to"" and not ""achieve.""

I am realizing that reset can be a strong thing too, does not always mean calm and gentle. I feel so refreshed, energized and light headed. Made me revaluate my understanding for reset.
Btw, I have an issue I need a little help with. Whenever I am in blank pose I get pain in my back, which is so weird. Like I have truly learned to hold it, but it aches quite a bit. Maybe I need to soften my back somehow within the movement. Might be a tension reaction when something gets a little challenging.

Today I was able to do 13 & 14, (which led me here after) and felt so good in that final shivasana. I look forward to resetting tomorrow (today at its now 2am), to know that I can listen to my body and not feel guilt for choosing what I feel is right, and I love that I was able to see a next day result that - yes a break helped so much, I craved double yoga.

858.0,"Motivation: someone was asking about it earlier and I thought this might help!  A really interesting video done by manflow yoga on YouTube really captured what keeps me doing this, everyday,  for 3 years. 1. I think about the immediate reward,  which,  for me it's feeling mentally well! I also feel physically better, stronger, and looser. 2. If that doesn't work,  I watch YouTube videos regarding the benefits others have received from doing yoga daily.  There's a ton of them to watch! I often get caught up in the enthusiasm and hit the mat.  3. The 5 minute rule: you can do just about anything for 5 minutes.  After 5 minutes,  you're still not into it? Stop! No guilt! 4. Finally,  how am I? Is it pms time? Time for pms yoga. Am I sick? Time for sicko yoga. Am I  tired,  stressed sad? There's yoga for that too! My husband made the excellent recommendation of creating a Playlist for each of my moods/ needs (physical and mental) and then I can use one of those videos rather than searching.  I hope that this helps!",UgxR14BSFAE_djT5jJZ4AaABAg,16.0,459.0,2022-01-16T01:05:45Z,0.9868988990783691
