894.0,"In the last 4 years I had two kids and making time for yoga has been very sporadic. My back pain and shoulder pain returned. The first thought I had when 2022 began was, ‚ÄúI have to move my body somehow!‚Äù I then got a call from my friend Carmelle inviting me to join the Move challenge. It‚Äôs been my homecoming.

I‚Äôve been doing YWA since she began on YouTube all those years ago and it feels so encouraging to hear her speak to me in each season and to see Benjiüòç, ugh it‚Äôs been such a treat.

The hardest thing is showing up to the mat. I fought to do it today and immediately, a dirty diaper was waiting for me. I did my practice and my child did it with me for a bit before she went to play on her own. The 20 minutes by myself recharged me enough to resume my chores.

What was lasting the longest was a splitting headache so the last thing I wanted to do was any form of exercise.

I'd been wanting to do this journey but have felt so crap that I didn't see the point in starting yet. 

Randomly, about an hour ago I got the urge to give it a go, I figured that if it made me feel worse I'd stop.

 
So now I'm sitting here having completed day 1 (I know, a few days late) but guys, my headache is completely gone!

1405.0,"I couldn't do this when it first came out live because I had severe headache and wasn't prepared. Yesterday while I was walking back home from work, I felt like crying so bad there was this massive build up of energy all of a sudden I felt VERY emotional. As I reached home, I was in the shower sobbing, I don't even know why it could be from my headache or stress or maybe emotions I needed to release that I was holding myself back from feeling them. I cried for a good straight 20 minutes and it felt very relieving. I've never cried like that in so long. I wasn't even thinking ""what if someone heard me"" I was completely surrendering and being there for myself. I don't want to exegerrate but it felt like something was coming out from my body and leaving. It felt like something was sitting on my throat and chest. Today, although I still feel tired and headache and have funny puffy eyes I decided to hop on the mat. I didn't do the downward dog and modified some poses but I feel good now that I am on this journey AGAIN with you and the rest of the community. To anyone reading this, just a reminder to be with your emotions and don't be shy to express specially sadness because its a part of being human. Be there for yourself. Be there for yourself like you're there for someone when their sick. Never feel embarrassed to ask for help and say ""I am not okay"", something I am learning to do. Wow! I am very aware that I wrote so much. Sheesh. Anyways, I send you all so much love and light. Namaste. Thank you Adriene.

Adriene, you've helped me repair my body gradually and to be with the journey as it unfolds is an illuminating gift. I could list many things that make you an incredible teacher Adriene but one I want to comment on specifically, especially since you alluded to it in this day's practice is your awesome skill in describing what to do in a simple, direct and loving way. I don't have to rely on the screen every second which is a relief because if I did I wouldn't get the best stretch etc. Though my focus has improved over the years, I can still struggle with coordination, and following along in practices that involve movement like yoga or dance etc. has historically also a practice in not quite getting it at the same pace as the rest of the class and enduring internal blows of humiliation haha!

If you've ever started one of Adriene's daily practices a few days late, do you:

1. Start with Day 1 and finish a bit later (or try to catch up somehow)?
2. Start with the practice meant for the day you started and forget about the previous sessions?

1741.0,"Adrienne, you do so much for your viewers by providing a guided peaceful stretching session, but why don't you do anything for the Hindus whom which yoga is stolen from? There is no mention of the religious meaning of yoga in your videos and I find that to be a bit weird. Is it perhaps insulting in a way to not give credit to Hinduism while simultaneously explaining to viewers that yoga is the religious lifestyle of Hinduism? Covertly pushing religion is unethical, as is stealing a religious practice and pretending it's secular to disguise its true meaning in order to sell it to people who don't identify as religious. Hopefully those diving into ""yoga"" for the first time see this before they get caught up in this big beast of a business that has completely distorted this practice in the west. Your youtube series if often mentioned to me when I mention the problems of yoga in the West, which I find very ironic being that you are influencing 10.6 million subscribers with the colonized delusion of Western ""yoga"", not actual yoga.",UgzAVm931gRuG0YWe2h4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2022-01-03T14:59:03Z,-0.9980059266090393

Showing up was hard today, but well worth it. And how incredible to be doing this with all of you - the tens of thousands who were doing it with me just now. Holy holy.

2083.0,"One year ago, I started Breath, my first 30day yoga journey. I have been practicing almost consistently ever since. It amazes me to see how far I have come over the past year - I have gained flexibility and strength, but more importantly, Yoga and Adriene have changed my attitude towards life. I remember these gems which I often bring up in my daily life-
- It is okay to fail. We can always, always begin again. There is no shame or guilt in that. 
- When overwhelmed, just breathe and start again with what's in your control.
-Don't worry about the results, just be mindful and enjoy the process.
- There is always something to be grateful for, especially the privileges that we take for granted. When I practice gratitude, sometimes even as small as to be able to take a full deep breath in, it puts my mind in a positive space and helps me keep myself grounded.
I am deeply thankful for Yoga with Adriene and this amazing community to help me be stronger and more resilient, physically as well as mentally. Thank you from the bottom of my heart üôè",UgzH8QnUQDqQ3TtpG6V4AaABAg,0.0,3.0,2022-01-03T04:49:21Z,0.9996211528778076

2165.0,"Day One ‚úÖ 3 January 2022

This is my first time joining YWA 30 days yoga challenge. I watched this video yesterday night before I do it this morning. I thought this will be very easy and relaxing because I‚Äôve already done all the poses in this video before. But, surprisingly, I found it quiet challenging starting from the downward facing dog, because I‚Äôve never hold these poses for so long. I can already feel how this yoga challenge will change me. It‚Äôs like when workout meets meditation, I will be burning calories but I still need to TRY to be calm & mindful. That‚Äôs the hardest part for me. I really hope I can come back to this practice after 30 days and see how I‚Äôve change. Will I find this easier?

Sometimes 15 min, sometimes 1 hour but no matter what happened in my life, I showed up everyday . I always practice in the evening. It's easy, instead of scrolling down instagram or watching the news (i do watch the news, just not in the evening), I just take my mat out and start a yoga video. Sometimes I don't feel like it, but I always feel better afterwards and kinda of proud of myself for doing something good for me for once. I'm actually hoping to practice more this year, and with different teachers (not that I'm ditching my first one), but I've noticed my practice feels different with different teacher, it's kind of fascinating how each individual bring their own unique energy to the mat and to their students.

I have EDS and PoTS and I find Yoga is one of the best tools for me to manage my conditions(different things work for different people even with similar conditions though). The YWA 30 days each January is always such a beautiful challenge - I love doing it because I always feel so much better after and it resets my practice and motivation for months to come. Each year it gets easier to find the mat even when things are hard, and I hope this year I can get even stronger both physically and mentally. I'm ready to Move üíõ

I was sitting on my mat, smelling the sweet almost spring-y air coming in through my window and I felt like crying because a sudden calm and safety came over me. I have no idea what happened but I know now that even though trying this video today isn't necessarily going to mean I'll be comitting to doing this everyday,  today I made the right decision. And that gives me hope that I'll make some more right decisions this year. Thank you, dear Adriene <3",UgwRpm1z-v7B0Nu3UPt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-02T19:20:25Z,0.9961156845092773

Why force myself into a position that isn't going to benefit me today? As I relax in child's pose for a moment I think to myself was this new mindset the key to all my recent progress?

However, every year I try to commit to these 30 days of yoga and I hope that this year, maybe I can last the duration. Because when I do these yoga practices, when I cn hear someone with me in the dark,  I feel like I can manage the fear and the panic just long enough to feel pride and hope in and for myself.

3371.0,"Dear Adriene 1st things first! Thank you for putting yourself out there, showing up for others, sharing your loving kindness and generosity of spirit beyond what the mind's eye could ever imagine. You are amazing! Please allow those words to land in your heart center, from my heart to yours.
My journey with Yoga began many moons ago, in 2001. Fast Forward to 2020, numbers in the past meant to me having perfect vision, but that was before the Covid-19 Pandemic Outbreak brought so many of us to our knees, changing our lives forever. 

I remember being the last student walking out the door as the owner who i adored was locking up the evening I finished my yoga practice. The Studio became my sacred place, one that i would return to again and again over the next 7 years, becoming in time well spent, my safe place, my home away from home. 
I discovered in that time a community of the most loving and kind down to earth people I had found to share my practice with from 2013- March of 2020. The Day our beloved Yoga Studio closed its doors for the very last time. 
Fast forward to today. My1st day returning to my mat since the Pandemic changed life as  so many of us thought we knew it. 

My yoga mat has weathered with me through many, many storms, since i first set my mat down to practice  almost 2 decades ago. My oftentimes mindful and just as often thoughtless folding and unfolding of so many tightly wrapped up unresolved memories and emotions. 
I never knew before I began my journey within the practice of Yoga, there was so much more to the practice than meets the eye. I had stored deep within my tissues so many unresolved issues, locked up over 68 years of living, learning, giving, taking, holding, clinging, loving, laughter and tears. 

I am in many ways, the same person when it gets right down to it, that I was before starting my practice as a yogini. But I have gained so much wisdom and understanding that all the Therapy in the world could never have touched or unlocked.
And yet I hesitate today nervous, unsure, with so many mixed emotions,on my first day back  hoping to reignite the practice that has served me so well over time.
My practice that I dropped  unlovingly,  like a hot potato only 2 years  ago, as businesses, schools. peoples livelihoods and lives, came to a  screeching halt. 

My head is once again bursting with thoughts of ifs ands and buts.
But,,, I have come to the realization that although there are so many things that are out of our control.  I still have the opportunity to do things that are nourishing and productive and good for my spirit.  
With that realization, I have chosen to be here now, today, with a new community, with people I do not yet know and likely will never bond with as I did before.
I am hopeful and sure as the sun rises and sets each day. My spirit will be reignited once again as Adrienne has generously offered to be our guide bringing us lovingly back home to our center, our heart as one. Namaste!",UgyJLNw3dB_t_X1sPY14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-02T18:12:12Z,0.3241526979675837

I live in the north west of England have been doing yoga for about 25 years now on and off but I got back into it 7 years ago when I was ill and had time at home and thanks to yogawithadriene I practice everyday to keep fit and healthy. Adriene is an inspiration to so many people and a wonderful giving person - I wish I knew her personally. I am always promoting yogawithadriene to my family and friends as I love her style. I am 50 years old and I can still do the splits which I think is mainly due to yoga.
Roll on to many more years of yogawithadriene!

I started Breathe last year and quit on myself halfway through the month. Before and after that, I came to my mat when I carved the time out for myself. Honestly, it has been rare. On top of that history, I've been struggling with daily headaches and then I broke a toe Christmas Eve. So, I made it through 15 or 20 minutes of this video by modifying what I needed to for my foot and/or going to come child's pose or cat/cow when I couldn't physically do the pose due to the toe. At that 15/20 minute point, I wanted to give up. I paused Adriene and happened to scroll through the comments. You guys gave me the reminders, motivation & connection I needed in that moment.

3848.0,Did day 1. Been doing today for some time now following Adrienne‚Äôs 30day challenges so this was good.   Convinced 2 family members to start their yoga journey.  Told them it is for beginners to experienced and all the other things Adrienne said in the preambles.  BUT day 1 was way too intense and hard. Started off calm and gentle but then the poses for beginners was way way too much too early.  Put these 2 family members off and they are not showing up tomorrow.  This seems to be common with all the other 30day videos as well. Starts off too intense which puts people off from continuing.  Suggestion is to really start slow and easy to gain peoples confidence so they do show up and continue with the 30days  and then ramp it up.  Lots of time to ramp things things up so why go too hard /intense from day 1?

Came here to thank Adriene for helping me to deepen my yoga practice over the past year. I‚Äôve noticed that even on the days I don‚Äôt feel like it, or maybe especially on those days, after I‚Äôm done I always feel more grounded and am always happy I took the time to practice. Yoga helps me carry the weight of the world.

I had a question about big twists at 18:40. Is the goal to be working toward pulling the raised arm back, stretching the pec and shoulder, and also squeezing/pressing abdominals and upper body in toward the front knee/thigh?

This will be my first time joining the 30 days at the same time as it's released. I'm so excited. 
Didn't think that it would be so much fun when I started doing yoga. 
I started to do yoga just for the sake of doing something for my body but with each day, I realized that it changed. For my otherthinking mind, it was hard at the start to stop thinking about how it must look for an outsider when I do yoga but I'm getting there.

4215.0,If you just did this class and thought there is no way I can do this for 30 days - YES YOU CAN! I thought the same thing when I did my first 30 day Yoga with Adrienne challenge in the summer of 2018. It was not easy but I fell in love with yoga and have not stopped since. I begin my yoga teacher training in February this year and I am so excited! Thank you Adriene for being my original teacher.

4218.0,"So excited for this, day 1. I‚Äôve been away far too long. Still, a beginner, I stopped my yoga journey when life got in the way. Why? I don‚Äôt know. Cocky? Probably. The farther away I got, the stiffer I became. The older I felt. Then I fell off my eating plan. Now 2 years later and I‚Äôve gained 40 pounds but more importantly than that, all my pains and stiffness have reoccurred. I feel older than my years (61 on the 12th) Not what I had planned for my life. Time to stop this madness. I know yoga and the keto way of eating is for me. No one‚Äôs coming to my rescue. It‚Äôs a new year and I‚Äôm excited to take back the reins of my life! You‚Äôre never too old to change, to improve yourself, no matter what that may entail. I thank Adriene for these free sessions. Not only does she offer a daily flow, she teaches!! And she‚Äôs not boring!! (Unfortunately so many others put me to sleep üò¥ üòÇ) So here‚Äôs to 2022 and all it‚Äôs possibilities!!

4245.0,"Hi, and Happy new year from Scotland.  I have been practising yoga for years but have recently been neglecting my (mostly) daily yoga because of chronic pain in my hip, groin and back.  I am only 51 but diagnosed with arthritis last year.  It was getting me down, because some of the yoga poses I used to find easy are now impossible or hard, and some poses now hurt to do.  But yoga was also good for me mentally, and I noticed it wasn't doing me any good by missing my daily yoga and mindfulness.  My breathing was becoming more shallow again, I was becoming more anxious and I had tension in my jaw etc.  I am now determined to start practising again and this 30 day challenge is going to be the thing that gets me back!  I am just going to accept I can't be as good as I once was and be easy on myself...if there is a pose I can't manage or it hurts, I will just do something else and enjoy it anyway.  I am going to be positive and focus on what I can do and not what I can't :)  Thank you Adriene, Namaste x",UgxrRQ5j7nlhT5DzSWx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-02T11:59:05Z,0.9797171950340271

I am not really flexible and some asanas were very hard for me to do, also, I had to adjust myself to downward dog position so my wrists don't hurt. But it was al worth it!

Just one practical question maybe someone can help me with: unfortunately, my right wrist is a bit 'injured' (longlasting), so it is quite hard to put weight on it for a longer period of time. Now, many Yoga movements need this and I generally feel better after doing this and I sometimes use the underarms but it is not the same and not always possible...does anyone have an idea?

4762.0,The yoga mat is a place where you can bring it all and leave it all. Like many others I began my everyday practice once my home state was placed under quarantine. Yoga called me when I was 16 but I was not in need of it yet. As my body and mind began to age a bit I realized that I needed a cure but the gym life wasn‚Äôt for me. My joints and muscles were becoming sore on a regular basis due to constant hard labor. I was becoming fatigued mid day every day shortly after lunch. I needed help. I studied about the health benefits of regular practice and looked on YouTube and somehow stumbled across yoga with Adrian. Here I am almost two years strong in my practice and I can say that I‚Äôm a brand new being. I can endure hours of work with no pain in my body and my mind operates from both sides . I hit the mat early to start my day and it truly is a cheat code in this game of life. I‚Äôm done now. Lets flow people!
