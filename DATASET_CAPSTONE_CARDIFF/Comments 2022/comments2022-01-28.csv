I am a grandmother of 6 month old baby girls, and I take care of them about 4 days a week.  Let me tell ya…I spend a lot of time on the floor “moving” around with them in all kinds of positions.  I am in fairly good shape, but this journey has made me so much more aware of my movements and how to use my breath to safely navigate my way around their little wiggly bodies (their happy baby and super man poses are perfect too!) I think of you everyday because of it, and I send you prayers of thanksgiving!  You also make me bust out laughing often…like today, “wait what I didn’t sign up for this!”  Much love to you Adrienne…🐾 The tea is so good too:)",UgxXg-C3YfIiEitSgTt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-31T01:06:05Z,0.9997194409370422

Dear Adriene,  Today’s practice I felt so comforted and full of love, which is something I realised we can make as part of our everyday life! We will have many more moons to go, and asking ourselves, “How am I feeling?” matched with “How do I want to feel?” empowers us in so many ways. I am currently listening to Louise Hay’s book, _“The Power is Within You”_ and when we treat ourselves with tendering loving kindness, we create a much better relationship with ourselves that is filled with joy and love all our live long days. Thank you Adriene, for your wonderful TLC to all of us. With love, Emily",UgyoeVx4PeTbtbFAXkp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-01-30T11:21:31Z,0.9998201727867126

522.0,"This practice (especially after yesterday's practice) makes me think of a philosophy that bell hooks proposed. Grossly paraphrased here, it has to do with the stories that we are often most familiar with: the hero's journey. There's always a battle, a fight, and a conquering. And I love Star Wars, but we are all too familiar with aggression and violence because of a history of colonialism, societys' hierarchies, oppression, or stories in pop culture. Instead, what if we took a journey of love? Just love. The mantra of ""I am strong"" can be interpreted in so many ways! I am reminded to take care of myself and others, and maybe, just maybe, through my strength of love, I can achieve what I want, which will, in turn, will make the world a better place.",Ugy1nqXvwju93GLjCQh4AaABAg,1.0,4.0,2022-01-29T14:12:46Z,0.9918702840805054

656.0,"We are so close to the end of this month, I’m proud of all of us for doing this.
It’s like a physical therapy to heal a lot more besides some words we can use for it and that feels good no matter how hard we can struggle at times. 
I can’t thank my partner enough for her to do it with me everyday. 
Let’s keep going and doing this for our best versions of ourselves ✨",Ugxp5lescy8QAu21wit4AaABAg,3.0,38.0,2022-01-29T10:22:14Z,0.9997565150260925
