15.0,"I just want to say that I’ve been watching these videos for years and took a bit of a break before restarting again recently. I’m feeling as though Adrienne moves a lot faster now then she did before. I actually miss some more of the guidance with regards to how to specifically move that I feel she was more specific with before. The general movement words and placements words actually leave me really anxious because I can never keep up and have to keep rewinding to figure out what positions I’m supposed to get into. Just my two cents. Still love what Adrienne is doing, obviously!",UgycCtUZIL7Es11isSN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-17T18:44:42Z,-0.9908131957054138

18.0,Adriene does such an amazing job at knowing when I am doing a pose incorrectly and teaching me what Ishould be doing instead. I’ve never done yoga before deciding to start this challenge.

I ended up testing positive for Covid yesterday but am very lucky to not have any major symptoms, so now feels like the perfect time for me to pick up the practice again - there's some silver linings to having to isolate for at least a week.

I've worked out for the last 6 years, played tennis for 11 and have even run on and off, but this is the first time I'm doing yoga and the poses we do here are making me stretch and move in ways I've never done before. It's quite freeing and exciting to feel my body gain a whole new level of mobility I didn't know it could. Even though I'm far from doing them perfectly, or even well tbh, I'm starting to love the stretch and the burn. It's a silent proof that my body can do amazing things, it can move in so many ways and I feel connected and in touch with it during.

It was really hard for me to get on the mat today. But now, I am happy I did. Connecting mind, body, and spirit. I knew as soon as you made the comment about maybe having a hard time getting on the mat that this was gonna be a great practice. And it was! Thank you so, so much for sharing!

Now I’ve caught back up to you and this morning did the practice at 7am. Yay me! 

I appreciate your gentle leading of us, your sweet words of encouragement and just YOU!  It is very helpful when you tell us how much longer a challenging moment will continue. Ugh. How long is this? Adriene. We are doing this for three more…. I can handle that! 😉

In the past, I would address this by moving permanently out of sync and finish a day (or two or four) behind everyone.

Yesterday I struggled so much with the concept of uplift, the movement, the focus, the breathing. I was so down, yet I showed up and tried. Today I am able to connect to mobility, so I will jump back and use the energy of being mobile to start yesterday’s practice again since I was missing the last couple of minutes, crying and watching the video, unable to move physically, but moving with my emotions. Today I feel mobile again. It’s amazing how I meet myself every single day on the mat - regardless with what I show up with - and grow from there in between the beautiful concepts physically and mentally. Off to day 10, using todays mobility to uplift myself.",UgxRfvYy3o7qv6phq5d4AaABAg,2.0,3.0,2022-01-12T10:33:09Z,0.9993898868560791

1041.0,Absolutely adore Adriene and the team that makes all this possible... but I have to say it is a shame that the videos are released at 10.00 am UK time as it means anyone who practices before work is a day behind.,UgwKZtQaC03yfBJqnUp4AaABAg,1.0,5.0,2022-01-12T06:50:07Z,-0.9864761233329773

1043.0,"This is my fourth 30 day journey with Adriene, I am shocked at how well I can do poses now that use to give me some trouble and would make my body feel a lot different. I started with Adriene in 2017 after my surgery on my abdominal for recovery and haven’t looked back since. My strength has increased right along with my confidence!

Thankyou Adriene for your lovely videos. Your hard work healing others doesn’t go unnoticed. I watched your recent GQ interview and I love everything about it. Such a wholesome lady!

Sending love here from London 🤍",Ugw8g9GfHZgGZPmqvbd4AaABAg,0.0,40.0,2022-01-12T00:33:47Z,0.9998533725738525
1048.0,If you're new to this and the flexibility that Adriene promotes confuses you a bit (like it did me) stick with it. Eventually you'll gather the vocab (and the yoga ability!--believe it or not) to get the most out of it when she encourages you to be yourself. It actually feels kind of cool to gain the experience.,UgyoIz5QJ63U8R2tQ1p4AaABAg,0.0,13.0,2022-01-12T00:17:41Z,0.9866471290588379
