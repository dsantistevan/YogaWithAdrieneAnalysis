6.0,"I started 24 days ago, and missed only one day since. Last week my 1 year old son was admitted to hospital and is currently in ICU. There are days where I don't even wanna get out of bed but I do. I was on the verge of quitting Move then somewhere deep within I was reminded that this is a yoga challenge not a yoga easy and so I forced myself teary and all to open up my mat and keep going. I'm at the hospital everyday for about 10 to 13 hours daily. The yoga is one of the thing's that are helping carry me through, along with mentorship from spiritual teachers, Gurus, as well as love and support from family, friends and hard working hospital staff.

14.0,Day 23 ✅ I liked how this practice was more in-depth by being mindful of the stretches and slowing down. I always have a problem with slowing down but since this 30 day challenge I have been slowing it down consciously and being kinder to myself. I love this practice and will definitely revisit it as one of my favourites! Adriene and Benji you guys are gems 💎!

I don't know Adriene if you did it on purpose or what haha but this practice was SPOT ON I mean PERFECT for the way I'm feeling haha I was amazed and shook but I figure you probably knew what you were doing yesterday and now today with this one.

42.0,"Hi there. I'm practicing away at my own speed here in Ireland ( just completed day 23 on 10th Feb! I wanted to say how poignant I thought today's practice was and is for me. Firstly, the fact I'm continuing shows a softening in attitude. When I missed a day or two after I think day 6 because I ached so much, I was tempted to give up, feeling like I'd failed. Your encouraging words have helped me open up to myself and soften in my attitude. So yes, it's spilling off the mat 😁. Today I loved the fusion of strong poses whilst thinking about softening. I suddenly became aware.. ""To be soft is to be strong "".
I'm here alone, goodness knows how many  days behind but I feel so connected to you and the journey. Thankyou so so much for what you bring to the world Adriene 🙏💕",Ugz_dHSSLukjsAiit1F4AaABAg,2.0,3.0,2022-02-10T11:58:44Z,0.9961840510368347

But this year, if I miss a day or four, I’ve just been picking up where I left off, and because of the similar-length practices and Adriene’s whole find-what-feels-good approach, it’s not felt like a crisis.

May 1, I started the first of 4 30 day programs. Day 3 or 4 nearly was the end of me LOL, but I stuck it out and saw improvements! Sept came and life and work got crazy. I buckled down Jan 2, but I am finding so many poses this time are hard! Four months off seems worse than a lifetime of not having done anything. The poses seem more intricate, more twisty, and ""not available"" to me. I don't remember thinking before that I just couldn't get into a pose, but now, sometimes, I just can't seem to get anywhere near some. I am going to keep showing up though!! I might go back and do the first 30 day program I did last year for Feb. I am so appreciative for all these videos, and Adriene's gentle guidance.

522.0,"Another wonderful gift of a practice.  Thank you Adriene, for bringing softness and self compassion to this space, showing people how to make their own way rather than rush from pose to pose in an effort to keep up with someone else.  What a wonderful reminder to approach life in our own way, recognizing that our journey as our own.

In that spirit, I want to gently remind anyone reading this about how powerful you are.  I see a lot of comments about how ""Adriene makes my life so much better""  or ""yoga changed me"".  While I appreciate those sentiments and especially appreciate everything that Adriene shares through here work (it certainly inspires me in more ways than just my yoga practice), I want to softly remind you, dear reader, that you are the one choosing happiness.  You are choosing to come to the mat and do the things that give meaning to your day.
