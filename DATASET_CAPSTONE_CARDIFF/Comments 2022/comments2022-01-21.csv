I don't feel like I did yoga today. it was the same vibe for me as the other day where she wore a bun and everyone commented on how hard it was.

194.0,"So grateful for this journey's theme. I have always struggled with visceral fat deep within my core. I have a unique body type (recently defined as ""TOFI""), where my body produces nearly all fat as visceral fat, surrounding my organs, deep within my core. My fat isn't stored anywhere else in my body. Not only does this increase health risks, but it is (to society) considered ""unattractive."" Me, being naturally ""skinny"" everywhere else, and having a very petite frame, only exaggerates the unique proportion of my extended mid-line. The amount of times I'm called ""pregnant"" because of my body shape, is exhausting. After years of hating my body, due to others' comments, I have struggled with self acceptance. However, I'm finally on a healing journey, taking the steps to love myself, both mentally AND physically. This ""Move"" theme is perfect for me. I am determined to reduce the visceral fat I produce, while shaping the other parts of my body. Throughout this journey, I will not only feel better mentally, but my physical body will transform before my eyes. To a body I have always desired. Very grateful and excited to be on this journey.

I also tired in my neck and shoulders which to me says I'm not doing it right, and that's probably where my heated thoughts came from, that recovering perfectionist inside getting mad when I'm not doing something right...

Love Letter Earth by Thich Nhat Hanh 
The earth is you. You are the earth. When you realize there is no separation, says Thich Nhat Hanh, you fall completely in love with this beautiful planet.
At this very moment, the earth is above you, below you, all around you, and even inside you. The earth is everywhere.
You may be used to thinking of the earth as only the ground beneath your feet. But the water, the sea, the sky, and everything around us comes from the earth. Everything outside us and everything inside us come from the earth.
We often forget that the planet we are living on has given us all the elements that make up our bodies. The water in our flesh, our bones, and all the microscopic cells inside our bodies all come from the earth and are part of the earth. The earth is not just the environment we live in.

My therapist recommended Yoga with Adriene by name. I cannot express how valuable Adriene has been in the process of my recovery. For the first time in many years, I am hopeful for the future.

I wish to express my sincere gratitude to you.

Maybe it’s my own insecurity with my core, but it feels like westernization and cultural appropriation of yoga… but having said that, I totally understand the dynamic of having to keep all different kinds of people happy and practicing yoga. So in the end, it’s all good 😌 But for me, I need to find another practice to do after this one to round it out. Thank you!

But it may be due to the fact that typically I join from the tv in our den. This morning I used my phone and earbuds in our bedroom so I wouldn’t wake up family still sleeping in on this very wintery morning. I was able to do all the practices very well so far and as I’m 65 years old now I want to keep my strength and balance so I am fit for life.

704.0,"It’s really interesting how I am more inclined to take care of my breath now. I struggled a couple of times breathing through the more challenging movements, but I always returned. Was surprised how my movements were easier or even a little more controlled. Just a tiny bit, but being connected to my center and feeling it, physically especially, doesn’t hurt that much anymore. It’s also my mindset as I explore the feelings, even if there is a still unfamiliar or uncomfortable sensation. As long as it doesn’t hurt for real, it has a welcoming curious space nowadays. I no longer flee from the uncomfortable sensations, I really start to move in a more open-minded space. It’s incredible, this journey. And yes, I still sometimes struggle holding my breath or trying to strive for the perfect posture and pose, but it is less more the goal and I get better in accepting where I am at.",Ugxr0WNYsDu70nyQwFd4AaABAg,3.0,11.0,2022-01-22T10:27:57Z,0.9987468719482422
