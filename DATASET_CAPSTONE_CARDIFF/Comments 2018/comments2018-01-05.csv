0.0,"DAY 4! YESSSS! 

Notice how each inhale provides a deeper expansion, and how each exhale is an opportunity to soften and surrender and relax. 

Today‚Äôs floor-based yoga practice deepens your connection to full body awareness and breath.This is a great practice to bring energy to the body in a non taxing or depleting manner. 

From the ground up! YOU ARE DOING AWESOME! Listen to your breath and the subtleties of your practice.

236.0,I love your yoga classes. I‚Äôve been doing it now for almost a year. I‚Äôve never lasted that long in doing something on regular basis. I think that it is the fact that you are constantly changing how you move from one pose to the other. No video is the same. No repetition. It makes it easier to really stay focus on the movement because it is unpredictable. With routine exercises the mind starts wondering or working on problems but your yoga session is true yoga for mind and body. It is soooo therapeutic! I can‚Äôt thank you enough for what you do. ‚ù§Ô∏è,Ugz2de0pqt0772nK5wR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-04-28T14:21:24Z,0.9976270794868469

I'm consciously focusing on the video and movements, so I'm not seeing how the energy moves through me, but I can definitely feel it. I didn't realize how stuffed up my energy flow is. I'm familiar with the concept of directional breathing from Chinese practice, but I've never thought about actually doing it, especially during meditation.

I love this series already! I'm familiar with a lot of the other concepts essential to movement and practicing asanas from doing Pilates, but the mind body connection in Pilates is markedly different; it's by far more mechanical and doesn't move chi the same way.

359.0,"I had been doing YWA for the past two years and had never commented on one of the videos. But finally, I wanted to share that I had a truly horrible day today. However, thankfully, I decided to try one last thing to calm me down and decided to get on my yoga mat and continue on with Day 4 (usually floor exercises are not my favorite, but NOW I was focusing inward and actually paying attention to my breaths). Suddenly, everything seems alright in my life. I love who I am and where I am. Funny how some deep breaths can reverse a entire bad day.

So, at 11pm, when I would have gone to bed (after the tennis), I switched on youtube and found Day 4 and for the next half hour, I spent time on the mat going through the motions of this session.

It was the best thing I had done for myself all day, after an extremely hot afternoon and then a good portion of the night, being spent babysitting my nieces.  I had wanted to do something for myself all day and I was so surprised that I was itching to do yoga in my day and I think if it was anything else, I wouldn't have cared if I had missed the day.

I keep on saying how great I feel afterwards, and I have even taken it upon myself to spend extra time afterwards laying on the mat with my eyes closed and relaxed and tuned into mediation music.  I feel as though this yoga journey has put me on a really good path as I am always trying to find ways of relaxing and sometimes sitting doesn't do it for me, but these movements and concentration on every breath always puts me in a good place.

I started to overthink again, about something I haven't done, but really wanted to do, drawing possible conclusions of what might have happened if I did it

I felt my sitbones grounding first in a long time. I noticed that I store a lot of emotions in my hips. 
At first the thoughts were rushing through my head, but then I felt more at ease, more grounded. The thoughts were leaving my head and the boat pose got me smiling. I was trembeling and shaking, but when you talked about defying gravity I felt it. The worries lifted of my chest.

Whenever you say 'You are not alone.' I only gear you sing it and it makes my heart smile to know that other people are with me in this. I cannot  capture the numbers in my head, but commenting and getting answers if how I made the day of someone makes my day.

1644.0,"Good morning from Scotland Adriene (and Benji)!Thank you for another amazing practice. I found today physically easier, although I had to go easy on some of the poses, but what was most interesting today was all the emotions that came up for me during the practice. On a rational level I know there is no shame in not being able to do the wide-leg forward fold very well, but in this pose, and as I chose to stay in the twist in the other pose, I could hear a horrible dialogue in my mind, telling me that I am weak, or a failure. I think the emotions that came up for me in this practice highlight a broader issue that I experience off the mat. I have to learn to be kind to myself, and to be aware that looking after myself, and not to be always pushing and pushing, is something to be strived for, not punish myself for. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to have these experiences. x",UgzLLNuAnNcMArIrl3B4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2018-01-05T11:07:57Z,0.988972008228302

I am from Russia and I am a beginner at yoga, though I have stretched a lot in the past. I've always wanted to become more fluent if I can say that in yoga. I feel like this challenge would be a great basis for learning yoga and further development of my consciousness of my body and mind. I cant describe how peaceful and great I feel when I do this. I totally forget about all the stress and problems which I have been dealing with a lot for the past year. So I hope you read this and know how grateful I am for what you're doing.
