6.0,"A year ago today I was pretty sick with covid-19, and my partner and I spent the (United States) Thanksgiving holiday alone and pretty sick out here where we live. The symptoms lingered into 2021, but I started the 30 Day Breath journey on 1/1/21 along with daily meditation, and I slowly got better. I have continued to practice some of your 30 Day journeys all year, as well as the Chakra Ride and some others. I didn't practice every day and my health (and family life) suffered a few setbacks, but I practiced with you at least 100 days, maybe more. I realize now that this work has (while never feeling like work, but rather like love) really changed me inside and out. Here we are on the night before Thanksgiving, nearing the end of a very hard year all over the world, and now I'm also in my final week of True, and I just want to thank you SO MUCH for all the work and love that you give us all. I am so incredibly grateful. My mantra today was ""be more in my body"" and when you said ""now believe that it's already true"", I realized...it is! I have become much more in my body this past year. I teach t'ai chi and karate now, I just started a daily dance practice, and, well, I just feel more balanced in myself, centered, more me, moving inside and out. Thank you. üß° May peace and love surround you this holiday season, and may you feel as buoyant and balanced as you help us all to feel!

39.0,"Thank you, Adriene, from the very bottom of my heart. I've been practicing yoga with you for over 3 years now, and I have formed a deep-rooted appreciation for you and yoga. You've introduced such a beautiful art to me, and there's no way I can thank you enough. Along with sharing the art of yoga, you are astonishingly talented at guiding others through it. I just did this episode, and I was feeling very negative about myself. I suffer from severe anxiety and social anxiety, so I constantly overthink and analyze my behavior, tone, body language, etc. This causes me to notice unimportant flaws in myself that every human would have and dismiss in a heartbeat (I mean just the human species; of course you all worry about yourselves too, I just meant things that people with less anxiety would dismiss, like maybe speaking a few slurred words, or stuttering a bit.). At 3:34 , I think, you reassured me and told me that I should feel my feelings, and be true to myself. Adriene, your ability to connect with others so deeply (and VIRTUALLY!) continues to startle me. You are such a positive figure in my life, and I couldn't express enough how amazing you are. Yoga has been like a medication for my anxiety and other mental issues. Let me specify. YOUR yoga videos have been like a medication for my anxiety and other mental issues. Without you, I wouldn't have discovered who I am. Without you, I probably wouldn't be here today and now. The impact you've had on my life is immense. Thank you, again, from the bottom of my heart, and keep guiding others through the art of yoga.

Also bringing work home with me, trying to find that balance between leaving it there and thinking about things I could do next time!

201.0,"I have severe anxiety and I started this true yoga challenge as a way of getting exercise but also helping my anxiety. I'd been loving it, I looked forward to it because it was the only peaceful part of my day. Lately I've been struggling. Yesterday, doing day 22 I noticed when I went from one pose to the next my heart would beat like craazy. Proper palpatations. I'd get dizzy and by the end I was really nauseous and so weak I thought I might faint. It got better after eating and sitting down for a while. I hadn't eaten in a few hours or drank much water. I'd been pretty anxious too. Today it wasn't as bad but my heart was still going crazy every time I went from the lunge positions to warrior. Is anyone else familiar with this? Is it ok for this to happen? It's freaked me out and I'm afraid to do anymore yoga now.

215.0,"Here's a funny note on the hand positions: my go-to was to mirror your image on the screen first, i.e. my left hand up right hand down. Natural position for me, playing stringed instruments, I've always had a relationship with the left fingers up, right fingers down position, where the right is the structure (rhythm) and left is the more free (notes) part. So the funny aha for me, I've been playing a lot of piano recently and when we switched hands, I realized that piano is the opposite, left had down is the structural part, right hand (well, it's down when you're actually playing the keys of course,) the more free high part.¬†

I explored that I don‚Äôt need a cheat day or sweet treats. I started eating only whole home cooked meals made from basic foods. I became happy after learning to what healthy eating means for me. I explored weight(strength) and functional training and lifting heavy. Now it‚Äôs my jam. I traveled a lot and saw amazing places for the first time.
