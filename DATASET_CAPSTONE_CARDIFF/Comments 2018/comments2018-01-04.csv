163.0,"Hello Adrienne, and all my fellow yogis. This my third 30 day yoga journey, and my first time I am adding a comment. My mind wants to judge myself, and apologize for that, but my heart says there is no place for self judgement. So with that I want to say thank you Adrienne for who you are and what you do.                                        I have wanted to become a yoga teacher for many years, but honestly haven‚Äôt had the spare money, and more then that, I haven‚Äôt believed in myself enough. So at the end of last November, my wife inspired me to go on a one year yoga journey. She challenged me to do yoga everyday for one year, and to study all of the components of the true practice of yoga. She also challenged me to, at the end of my six months of daily yoga practice, to start teaching yoga, to my friends. So that is my journey. I am on day 112. 112 straight days!                                                    I never thought I could do anything like this before, but for some reason it felt right this time. I always looked at yoga from a different way...wanting to get strong and have a good physic, but when my wife gave me this challenge, I had such a different vision of my yoga practice. It has been a beautiful journey, and again I want to say thank you Adrienne. üôèüôèüôè",Ugw5ETtoYQVRsTTGACp4AaABAg,0.0,3.0,2020-03-22T20:02:31Z,0.993164598941803

Im also trying really hard to accept my limitations (will my heels ever touch the ground in downward dog? Probably not) but the one that really bothers me is going from plank or downward dog to a lunge. I still cant make that transition without taking about 3 steps in  between and looking like the most awkward person alive.  Does anyone else have this problem?  Its really the one thing that makes me feel so inadequate and frustrated in yoga. Keeping in mind Im not young, Im not skinny, and certainly not very bendy... is there any hope?   Almost every transition involves this move and my level of frustration just goes through the roof.   But I will stick with it. Cant say I find yoga calming or soothing, but every  day I hit the matt (some days literally!)

384.0,"favorite of the True journey so far! (I know it‚Äôs early days). Loved:
- the gentle allowing of Benji
- something I love which I‚Äôve noticed in many videos is how Adriene knows and acknowledges so many of the times I‚Äôm mentally happy or dreading or wishing a move was over, etc. like how she knows lying down is like yeah! Or acknowledges when something is painful (in the sense of muscle fatigue) and she‚Äôll say things like ‚Äúonly 2 more‚Äù it helps me and makes me feel validated and understood. 
- Probably the best thing of all to me is the integrity and down-to-earth quality. {Years ago I had dvd‚Äôs that I would only do a couple times because (though I hadn‚Äôt articulated exactly why) I didn‚Äôt like the pretentious vibe  or all the fluff of music and exotic location and instructors who were so serene and serious...hard to relate to. I know some ywa vids have elements of music or different location but to me the heart of ywa is the at home practices where she is talking directly to me! ‚ù§Ô∏è (ok talking to us all but the way I experience it just to me lol).

439.0,"What you said in the beginning about yoga and flexibility is so true! I've had these conversations so many times:

Me: I do yoga nearly everyday
Other person: You must be so flexible!
Me: No, not really

Orrr.....
Me: I like yoga
Other person: Oh, I'm not flexible enough to do yoga
Me: [sighs to self and explains it's not only about flexibility, but strength too, and you only get there with regular practice]

Also (and this one annoys me a bit really):
Me: I do yoga regularly
Other person: Oh, I should get into that, I need to stretch more
Me: What's stopping you?
Other person: I'm too lazy/can't be bothered

Love your stuff Adriene! I would be sad if you ever stopped putting up new videos because your Yoga makes me feel good... body and soul! You challenge me on the mat (nearly) every day and I love growing with you!",UgzJHAn3aPJwDNfGH854AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-05-01T22:05:23Z,0.8663451671600342

I have super tight hips. It's something I've been working a lot on recently and yoga has been a massive help. But I find lunges very difficult to maneuver in and out of. Particularly when transitioning from down dog or plank into a lunge. I end up clumsily landing on my knees and feel like I'm heaving my legs around. Once I'm in the lunge I have more control and can adjust as I need, but the transitioning in and out of them are super awkward and ends up pulling me out of the flow of the sequence.

It took me a while to get in the groove but once I did, boy did I start to feel good. I rocked every plank and even threw in an extra vinyasa (which I rarely ever do)!

But its interesting how every practise, you notice something else. In the last two your comments about drawing in your abs/navel etc. I have really been able to tune into. I guess because yoga is so progressive, as you do an asana, and you get more comfortable in it in terms of the main parts of it so you don't have to concentrate quite so much, you can then focus on the other parts. No longer worrying about your arms caving in you can think about abs etc.

On youtube they put hard things to do"" and then I always say what you said in one clip ""if you feel like do it that way if not do it easier way.

However, should I be aiming to breath in and out through the nose most of the time?  Many thanks.",Ugxp2R4S2-1maynfsrF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-04T12:35:28Z,0.9974363446235657
