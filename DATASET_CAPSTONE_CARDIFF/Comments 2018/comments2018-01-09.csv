2.0,"Thank you for today. You made me laugh when you said no photographers here hahah. Also, when you said that you are keeping it real by bringing the actual pillow that you use. I believe that is the reason I have been hooked to your channel for years. I could not adjust with any other yoga teachers since I discovered you. When you said that every breath is an I love you, I felt that. And, when you said that maybe we have some stuff off the mat that we are dealing with. I saw Benji doing his thing, I was jealous of his peace, and I started to get tears, I got tears multiple times in this practice. I am undergoing some stuff and I know most of us are.

I write to you from Puerto Rico. We're currently going through many earthquakes that have affected our island. Many of us are afraid and while I'm currently in a safe place, no one can predict what can happen. The island has been shaking since December 28th 2019.

I started this journey, TRUE, in Jan 1st and even without electricity I have managed to charge the phone and do the routines through here. 

I want to thank you for helping me keep calm and mindful through this tough process. You have changed my life.

 I was beside myself with stress, entering the last month of my thesis-writing, thinking I wouldn't make it. I've followed your videos on and of loads of times, but I've had such a challenge sticking to the routine. Now I'm on my 8th consecutive day and  I am feeling the changes already - and it is not just my abs hurting from yesterday's sun salutations! I can almost physically feel the pressure lifting from my chest! My mind is clearer, my heart is lighter and a significant bonus is that my body isn't nearly as tense from all that sitting behind a desk. I also find my hands almost instinctively finding each other in namaste throughout the day.  Thank you for you, and all that you do for all of us! I am confident I'll stick around to the end now!

227.0,"I've long struggled with corpse pose. It has been the most consistently difficult pose for me throughout 10+ years of practice. I have lordosis and when my core is weaker, the compression through the low back is particularly bad. Of late I have realized by margins that part of the problems was clenching and pulling down with the feet thus forcing my back to round so I've been working on freeing that up. Yesterday I stumbled on an image that really transformed the pose for me which was of lying on your back in water. Instead of being a bum, foot affair ft shoulder, head and low back, it became a torso-led experience that finally allowed for relaxation without pushing or bending my low back or actively pressing down with the core.

I tend to find my flow after sometime, so by the end of the practice I'm just then realizing how relaxed I feel. Life has been so turbulent lately with a major move to a new city, new job, and not too many connections. It's hard to deal with the anxiety and loneliness. To be able to reconnect and give myself sometime to just put that aside helps me realize how wound up I've become.

294.0,"Blessings Adriene, day 8 drove the breath even deeper. Placing insight on things that have been sheltered. Placing the spotlight and bringing enlightenment so we can let it go and have the roots grow even deeper. Catching myself throughout the day moving around in certain area's that seems to be tight. One thing to mention is those time within a pose when a wall is placed up via the breath and deep focus must be practiced to breath a bit deeper. The process of learning to  not force it while not allowing it to restrict the flow to the bells is a task that is being practiced.

In your inimitable lingo, the big deal-lio was to embrace such a low key intimacy with this tired ol‚Äô body, that the big shee-bang materialized from not trying to do the big shee-bang. The stretch/strengthening today reacquainted me with the parts that got worked over in Day 7 (also subtle, ratcheting). I, too, learn many things from Bengi the Yogi Doggi, and I‚Äôm always glad to see him there supporting you (/us).  Ps.

In the late afternoon, I got myself into a good place after having a home spa where I even had a facial for the first time in a long time.  This afternoon while I was out with a friend, I actually bought a home facial and I thought of using it tomorrow, but instead I used it this afternoon and it just a nice way to try and unwind and relax for an hour.  It got me so relaxed that I actually was thinking of skipping today's session until tomorrow but then I thought I am on schedule and having such a routine, I don't want to change anything, so it was nice to go to the mat and just take some time to breathe and stretch and just relax even more.

After today's session, I am kind of thinking that tomorrow will be a harder climb, but I feel ready ... and I look forward to continuing another week of this journey we are on together.",UgxAshzD30N4VX2PfHd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-10T12:17:00Z,0.997286319732666

848.0,Adrienne thank you for giving us the True 30 day yoga challenge.  Today day 9 my kiki (one of my four Mau's) decided to wake me 05.20 (U.K) so ideas of try/driving my myself back to sleep I decided to catch up on my 30 day challenge.  Day eight was a hard financial wake up call. So by doing day 8 to start by day as regained my focus and can't wait until after a full day of college I will be ready for day 9. What a fantastic way to wake up and feel the day. Namaste.  Bx,UgyZsF5eec7-0naaMQp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-10T06:09:06Z,0.9921278953552246
