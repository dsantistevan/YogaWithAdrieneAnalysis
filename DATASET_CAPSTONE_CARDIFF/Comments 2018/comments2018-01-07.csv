186.0,"I recently did the Dedicate series to get myself back into my yoga mindset, and it was so wonderful that I went back and started this one, True. I have been in my mind a lot lately, so have mostly been trying to focus on breath and body and just doing what I can each day to reconnect, but it is difficult for me. When I got to this video, and got to the end with the belly circles, I literally started crying. Part of the reason that I find it hard to drop into my body is because I've dealt with body image issues my whole life; but for some reason (and warning, hippy dippy stuff ahead), when I connected to my core and rubbed the belly that I try so hard to ignore, in that moment, I loved every inch of my stomach. It has nourished me, it has kept me strong, it has supported me, and all the while I have been hating it. Giving me that moment to really think about the most 'problematic' part of my body and how it is part of me as a whole and I should cherish it really struck me, and I'm grateful for this practice even more. Thanks, Adriene, for getting me to that lovely moment!",UgwAlUJEyWoP_0jJNl14AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2019-08-13T22:39:03Z,0.9978195428848267

But with yoga, I appreciate what I'm doing for my body instead of saying ""Thank god that plank is done"". And I'd enjoy my at home yoga journey maybe a little bit more if every time I lay on my back, my 70 pound dog didn't take that as an invite to lay on top of me!

I cant express my gratitude enough for sharing this practice, I was half hearted starting this video today, but truth is the hardest part is to starting the video and it will flow from there.

During this practice I was like ‚Ä¶..oh no. what's my body doing...
Then suddenly it ends, I was like WHAT? is that it.

But I feel ridiculously good after finishing the practice, it really opened my mind that exercise can inded bring happiness and so much more energy to life, I am so grateful for my discipline.

421.0,"Bit of a novel incoming, don't mind me...

I'm not unhealthy by any standards; I'm a dancer who works out several times a week, and though I don't eat as well as I want to, I still try to eat well. And because I've seen how much damage it's done to others in my life, I try my darnedest not to use weight (or, in my case specifically, perfect muscle tone) as the sole indicator of health. But I've been gaining weight over the last few years, basically since I've been out of college, and I've noticed it accumulating in my midsection, as tends to happen. So, as you might expect, I've developed some insecurities. I worry that I look mismatched with skinny arms, toned legs, and a bit of a ""pouch""; I worry that other dancers will think I'm weak and my dancing won't be enough to make up for it; I worry that I'll only gain more and more weight no matter what I do and I'll never get the toned abs I want. These worries are compounding as I'm on a brief self-imposed hiatus from dance/intense exercise in order to heal some shin splints.

So the belly rub and body-positive talk at the end? Nearly made me tear up. I hadn't realized the extent to which I was/am alienating my stomach from the rest of me, and the extent to which I was/am working on my body instead of with it. It'll take some time to truly internalize that philosophy, of course, but I'm definitely grateful to you for putting it so impactfully. Thanks for making this series... I wanted to supplement my dancing with some yoga anyway, and I'm only six days in, but I think I'm going to genuinely try to make this a long-term thing.

Side note : - I realized mid practice that my breath was perfectly synchronized, that I felt breath and movement as one thing. This is an amazing feeling.

This practice today reaffirmed for me that I do tend to flee from things that get difficult (i.e. maybe I wouldn't hold plank for the full duration just because I started to feel the burn).
