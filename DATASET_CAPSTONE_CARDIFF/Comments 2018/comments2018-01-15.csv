Practice patience and pay attention to what the body and the heart or guts are telling you.

I’ve been clenching some places but I didn’t notice where exactly.
I just felt stiff, tight and stressed.

Are there other excersizes to improve back and inner thigh flexibility, that would help with these poses? It feels fine when we do a simple forward fold, no problem, but in these particular poses hardly anything feels good, everything is tightened, crumpled and short, especially the back. Is anyone else facing such problems? I'd greatly appreciate any advice! <3",UgxYkNmnKELSLiFUyul4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-06-19T16:18:03Z,-0.9874827861785889

I convinced my Husband to join me for this session and the funniest thing happened. He's not really a Yoga person and it took some convincing to get him to join me. About 9 minutes in I look over and see his face. I can tell he's thinking to himself that this is just silly. I tell him, ""Just listen to her, Adriene knows, just listen babe, just listen"". Right as I finish my sentence and not a second longer do you (Adriene) look up from your mat, right at him, and say, ""Dude you have to trust me...."" The look on his face was priceless. He looked at me and was like, ""I think I smoked too much"". We live in Washington so this is legal here and after the session I think his mind was changed because he mentioned doing Yoga with me again. But man we had a good laugh. Thank you Adriene for being you. You definetly bring me this spiritual light hearted session and that is just what I need. A good laugh and some good inner peace.

362.0,"Yesterday I had this beautiful experience during your ""be you"" session, after which followed an utterly horrible nightmare this night, one in which I felt completely powerless (opposite of the masterful feeling I experienced on the mat). My nightmare was basically the complete polar opposite of my ecstatic union moment. I felt terrified and was shocked, I actually was flabbergasted that such deep layers of terror exist in my being as well, or may be experienced. I was afraid to go back to sleep so I decided to read up a bit (Dante's Inferno). After a while I decided it was time to go back to bed but I was still scared to go back to sleep. 40 minutes of yoga later I ended up falling asleep on the mat. I think I can go to sleep again now. I listened and was told I should be more careful about where I direct my energy, when to take a step back and be kind to myself and my body. so true. haha. namaste.",UgxJWIJVqdTcli7-elt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-03-09T04:31:32Z,-0.9880621433258057

382.0,Hi Adrienne! First off I’ve been loving the 30 day challenge! I had a strange experience and I’m just curious if it’s normal. When we were doing that first pose (knees up and tucking in) when I tuck my neck my upper back got the strangest HEAT! It literally felt as though someone suddenly held a hot surface to it. Is that a normal sensation with the stretch? I’ve never experienced something like that!!

387.0,"Adriene you're incredible and I can't thank you enough.  I have watched (and did the yoga) every day for 8 months, I started because I have been getting chest pains through stress at work.  But something miraculous happened during my yoga journey with you, well many things actually.  I have had eating problems and a low self esteem since a child, the last few years I've had a bad relationship with food and making sure I exercised everyday to lose weight, and never really getting anywhere.  I stopped the running and exercise videos to do yoga (to help with my anxieties) and not only did your videos massively help my anxieties and chest pains, I have lost nearly a stone in weight.  

The main thing is, for the first time in 25 years, I have a good relationship with food now, and I'm happier in myself and how I feel, I feel strong and am healthy weight.  Which has allowed me to let my partner get physically close to me, which has been a blessing.  I also feel I can react better to situations and I feel more in control of my life than I ever have done.  I'm a better worker, parent and lover.    

The things you say, just... do something amazing.  I totally admire you and want to thank you for helping and having a massive impact on my life.  Words don't really express what I feel you and your yoga teachings does for me.   I tell everyone I know to try your videos.

408.0,"Hiya! First of all; I may sound like a crazy dog lady, but Benji's presence brings something very special to these videos. His super chill doggy energy radiates and makes me feel calmer, even through a computer screen. Crazy, but true haha 😂
What I'm really here for though, is to tell you how thankful I am for this series, and everything you do in general. I've tried to do your 30 day yoga challenges a thousand times before, but I'd always end up quitting, going off track and never picking myself up, which is pretty much what I do with everything in my life. My lack of consistency and faith in myself had brought me to very dark places, and I'm tired of self sabotaging my every attempt to find some light. 
Something's different this time though. I've commited to a healthier lifestyle, and this series has become the guideline of my journey, like a set little domething that I must do every day, not out of obligation, but because it truly makes me feel better and BE better. You're a very special comunicator, Adrienne. What you say resonates deeply, and yet you manage to make your lessons lighthearted, playful, and just a joy to join.
I'm sorry for the wall of text, but today I really clicked, I REALLY listened, and I feel transformed. If, by chance, you ever read this, please know that I am eternally grateful for your work.

Some of your words towards the end really got to me and I teared up. What you seek you already have ❤️ thank you for helping me connect with myself and be a little more grounded.

I have also been experiencing a lot of pain in the left side of my chest (which only started after I had my baby). I went to the doctor and they just wanted to give me a pain reliever (which is extremely saddening because it doesn`t fix the problem) but I found that as long as I do your daily 30 day yoga I don't have the pain anymore.

Friday morning, I woke up with some form of rotovirus, which always hits me hard and kept me in bed or the bathroom for thirty-six hours. Yesterday I did the desk yoga practice, and I decided to tackle the True Listen practice this morning. It was perfect for someone recovering from stomach flu. Thanks, Adriene.

I made a commitment last August to do at least five minutes of yoga a day, usually first thing in the morning, and Adriene's videos have been awesome since they cover such a wide variety of time lengths and difficulty.

this morning I had to crawl to the mat. Seriously. Body aching all over, feeling exhausted. But I didn't want to fail my decision to do it every morning.

It's kind of chilly in my room so I had a blenkie over my lap in sukhasana.

577.0,"YESTERDAY, I came to the mat in the early evening as I had a busy day of house work and then in the afternoon, I had coffee with two new friends and so I was feeling tired but being on this journey, I made sure to switch on to day 14 and do what was possible within my limits and also was challenging for me for the day.

It was really nice to come to the mat and be welcomed with some time to reflect and listen to your innerself and take this journey of today as a way of giving myself a pat on the back for getting so far.  I wouldn't call it a rest day but it was nice to be able to give yourself some rest and to reflect internally.  I got a lot out of the day, mind you when it came to the giving the butt a work out, I was left in awe by what is possible if you continue down the yoga path.  While Adriene was rocking her foot and moving her leg (I thought she was going to rest her leg on her shoulder like she had done previously), I took the time to centre myself and just to calm down and reflect back on the day.  I achieved so much in the day that it was nice to slow it all down and just concentrate on myself.  There was no need to talk, there was no need to think about doing any housework or have chores to be done ... just time to myself ... and it was most rewarding.  

It is nice to know that yoga isn't all about proving or being as flexible as a rubber band, to achieve results and goals, it is so much more and I am truly thankful to have come to day 14 and stayed focused.  Sometimes, you never know what you will feel, find within or discover until you have walked the entire path, not just taken a five minute walk and switched off because it wasn't what you were expecting it to be at the start.  It is all about growing and I am definitely growing and appreciating these lessons.

Thank you Adriene.

623.0,Okay I don't wanna lie... The first five minutes I thought it would be the most boring yoga practice I've ever done but I admit that I was wrong!  Very wrong! It really challenges me to slow down and touch my mind and soul in this fast world and I think that's the point why I thought it would be boring but if I lean in and trust myself it gets better. The yummy part... Massaging the glutes... So great that I really love it and I think I will repeat this on my own if my glutes and legs are tight. At the end I was wondering where the time has gone so far. See you tomorrow!,UgwEDZC69HvqGoN0AaR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-16T14:48:23Z,0.9577295780181885

I’ve been feeling restless and irritated all day ( for absolutely no specific reason), my day at work seemed endless and boring and I thought “I’ll skip this slow practice and go straight to day 15 instead ( I’m one day behind), I need to sweat a bit!”  And then, I stopped to think and thought “come on, maybe this slow practice called “listen”  is EXACTLY what you need today”. 
So I did it. And it was fantastic ! I feel so relaxed now ( and that glute massage was incredible!). 
But it’s your words at the end that made my day “what you seek, you already have”. 
I got all teary. Thank you 🙏🏻❤️

I was never the one to blame other people but in this case I couldn't have helped to think that it was all his fault and he never valued the friendship/me as much as I did him. During the practice when you said ""maybe you should forgive yourself"" or something along those lines, it suddenly hit me that it was my fault for letting it end too. Along with that came a sense of relief because I feel like I'm in control/being accountable for things again instead of focusing so much on what I couldn't control.
