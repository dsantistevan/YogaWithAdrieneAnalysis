Today, when you can find stillness, allow the breath to move you. 

Lean in and learn. 
Learn to love and recall…
You are made of love. 
Take comfort!

PS: Wondering what we shall do after Day 30? I got you! We will have a free February yoga calendar for us all to follow along with. We will stick to our practice and connect - which will bring more energy and joy into your days! Let's keep going! x",Ugy21B70Q2LvQjP0BzF4AaABAg,20.0,250.0,2018-01-27T12:58:01Z,0.9997584223747253

I'm trying to do a year of yoga, and I'm in the middle of my second month. This year I've been through it though, so there were some days I didn't make it to the mat. But I feel like that doesn't mean that I'm starting over. As long as I'm getting to the mat each week, I'm still continuously showing up for myself.  And it helps to feel rewarded just one day at a time, one practice at a time.

107.0,"Day 26 - This was so good. Being still in today's practice really forced me to trust my body. I've been noticing in the recent practices that I'm able to trust myself, the mat, and you (Adriene) more and not have to look at the screen as much.  So I used that confidence today to trust myself with the stillness.  It was challenging at times (especially that lizard pose) but I listened to my body and what I could do and did that. The one nostril breathing was new to me and was a very interesting experience. When we came to kneeling pose to be still and feel the rush of energy - that was powerful! I felt dizzy but not dizzy - like I was in the middle of a funnel of energy but I was still, yet vibrating almost.  It's hard to articulate but was so incredibly wonderful.  Thank you.

113.0,"I know you say this almost every practice, but it struck me in a new way today: “honor exactly where you’re at today.” Not where I’m almost at, not where I want to be in five years—although a daily practice is exactly what I need to reach goals, there’s something powerful in honoring exactly where I am today. Sort of like a snapshot on 35mm film, this day is temporary but still beautiful and REAL. It’s not made less valid by not *quite* being at my goal. This isn’t just a stop on the way, it’s where I’m at today, and that in and of itself is an accomplishment and a beautiful thing. Thanks for being with me almost every day this year and this month, Adriene and yogis around the world. I’m growing in my skills and in my self-love every day, and that’s because of you—you telling me every day that just showing up is an act of courage, and to take ownership of it by being proud.

146.0,"Dear Adriene, I have been joining you for many a yoga practice for almost a year now.  I adore your channel and cannot thank you enough for all that you offer.  Because I watch and follow on YouTube channel on my television, I'm not in an easy place to LIKE and comment like I do on my computer.  Every time I successfully 'show up' and finish another practice (about 2-3 times per week), I think ""I really need to let Adriene know how wonderful she is next time I'm on my comuter!""  Here it is.  You are such a breath of fresh air and so good at what you do.  Keep up the great practices and all the sharing.  I'll be there...working at it, practicing.  I broke my humerus almost a year ago now....while out for a run....and it has been a challenge getting my range of motion back.  Because of your yoga practices, I keep working at it.  Simple positions like child's pose with arms stretched out above our head and forehead on the ground is still a HUGE challenge...but makes me work on extending my reach.  And of course, a ton of other poses as well.  Thank you thank you thank you!",UgxcJqnlu32qAJcfxkJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-04-25T21:15:59Z,0.9987537860870361

Never before have I felt this level of love and trust in myself! Thank you so much for letting me open the floodgates and allow myself to be productive, proud and brave again.
Also, it’s crazy you mentioned having a headache - I woke up with one and thought I must have been doing something wrong with the practice. Turns out, nope! You soothe all alms!!!

166.0,"I’m noticing a few positive changes as I progress (very slowly, there have been many roadblocks) through this programme. Firstly when I walk, I feel taller & freer and more conscious of my body and my breathe. I am pulling myself into my centre line & walking with a different confidence. Secondly & this is a biggie, I have chronic knee problems. They are swollen, stiff & no longer bend well especially the right knee. So child’s pose & deep bends of the knee are impossible /ill advised. So Sitting pose I have to do a gentle cross legged and in that pose my right knee has not sat flat for a long time, it sits higher than the left knee. But today I noticed a difference. The right knee is almost as low as the left so something happened and that’s good. A little message from my body maybe? Anyway, thank you.

283.0,"LOL Adriene. There were a couple points in this practice where you totally called me out! ""Every practice is different."" Even though I did yesterday's and today's in a row, the former was such a positive experience for me and this one was so much more difficult. (Maybe because I did two in a row!) But, in the last down dog of the practice, I lowered to my knees and kind of muttered/whined ""noooo"" RIGHT before you said ""Yes!"" I got a kick out of it. For real, though, regardless of the factors of today, being still is nowhere in my life right now. It's something I should come back to work on. But also, it's hard!

I can crack out a good few press ups in a row now, and downward dog is finally beginning to feel like a resting pose.
