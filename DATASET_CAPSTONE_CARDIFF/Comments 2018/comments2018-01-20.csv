Just want to put something out there to all my fellow OCD sufferers if you freaked out like I did when you first read the email! (I do honestly love the emails). Your thoughts don't have the fictional wizard sort of power, so don't worry if you suffer from violent or otherwise horrifying intrusive thoughts - these are NOT you, these are brain misfirings and the intrusions are usually the opposite of what you want or value. From my perspective, the power your thoughts have is to affect amazing changes in your mind, spirit and body, and then the world via your actions that feed on your yummy intentions :) YOU are in charge, not your OCD monster!

Since then I've been in survival mode and the fight with the insurance hasn't even begun.  So when I turned this video on and we heard the topic my boyfriend said he was so glad because I needed this.  This series has been a very calming home that I've needed to get through this stressful time.  I had 15 employees and was the center of the town.  I'm trying to build back but encounter more hurdles each day.  I have a long distance yoga buddy and we are doing this series together.  I really believe this has helped me cope.

454.0,"I thought it was really interesting your comment that what you pay attention to you send energy to. And if you pay attention to negatives that's where your energy goes and a negative outcome is more likely to follow.

On of my 'kind of new years resolutions' was to be more positive. I had a difficult couple of last months of 2017, but I also found myself moaning a lot, or being negative a lot as well, and thinking everything was terrible, so this year I have actively tried to see the positive in everything and spin a positive light, and not give attention to the negatives and I have felt SO GOOD so far.

Also, I have noticed that since the beginning of this challenge, nothing much has changed in my somewhat stiff and sore body, but I can notice there is something softer on my face, like I'm softer and more loving about myself. Plus, I became aware of multiple moments during the day when I was holding my breath (out of fear and non-stop anxiety) and I have started breathing deep through the fear and anxiety and it brings much acceptance, which helps a lot.
I started this challenge for my body and it's working on levels I did not expect, thank you so much for this help.

Of course, I'm not going to be great at it yet, but I'm on my mat trying. This is a much-needed practice for on the mat and definitely OFF the mat. I feel ready to tackle anything today.

You are truly Amazing. 

Today's practice was wonderful, a little more challenging due to bad night with leg and back pain because of a herniated disk I believe but You make it all possible. Didn't think of pain but how wonderful your practice Always is.

Thank you so much. If I could would do this again and more of your lovely voice and direction to a better me.üòä

589.0,"Such a crazy wonderfully timely practice for me.  Up until yesterday afternoon, everything was perfect...and this has been the case for a number of weeks.  Then after lunch I got blood results back that may indicate some thyroid problems, not necessarily life threatening, but may need some medication so waiting to hear from the doctor.

Then, I bumped my car trying to parallel park.  My car is only a year old and I felt so stupid making this poor judgement.  It;s this last thing that kept me awake part of the night and I tried hard to develop a mantra that would relax me.

Then I work this morning and as usual read the gospel for today (and here is where it gets funny or almost creepy), but in today's reading, Jesus' family comes to try to collect him because they think ""he is out of his mind.""  That's what it said!  So I prayed for a way over my state of mind trying to relax, but also begin for the first time to laugh a bit.

Then I turned on this video and my gratitude just poured!  Thank you Adriene for the binds and helping me to relax in these moments.  Since the prayer and practice, I've rested more on the fact that yes I have car insurance AND health insurance.  And just now I scheduled for the car to be fixed and a rental to get me around and I am honestly grateful that the bloodwork revealed something that I will be able to treat to remain healthy.

646.0,"During this practice I realized that there was a great deal of unconscious (until today), pessimistic thoughts going around my head - regarding exams and interviews coming up, but also regarding things I do - or can't do - in yoga. I realized that due to my pessimism, I wasn't doing my best: thinking that you will most probably fail can make you lazy. And, finally, I realized the incredible power of those quiet inner voices, reflected, as Adriene says, on the yoga mat: During each practice this month, I tell myself ""next time try to be more mindful / move slower at the beginning of a balance pose / don't push yourself more than your body needs"", and this tiny reminder-to-self actually works and each day my practice gets better and better (in my scale of things). On the other hand, quitting the self-judge on my difficulty to do certain things - like the eagle pose today - allows me to benefit from this difficulty, rather than be hurt (emotionally/mentally) by it.  Today, instead of thinking ""oh what the hell I cant interlace my hands together"", or ""my foot can come around my calf"", I said to myself, look, I'm going to find my limits and push there, not beyond. And I did! I stayed in the eagle pose longer than ever, and while ""simplified"" it was very very challenging for my body. In the end I felt amazing, better than I have felt after any other practice before. Thank you so much, Adriene! And anyone reading this, I hope that your little voices are a little bit more positive today as well :)",UgxqmQLzB-xysZ0aCYp4AaABAg,4.0,56.0,2018-01-20T09:47:13Z,0.9962978959083557
