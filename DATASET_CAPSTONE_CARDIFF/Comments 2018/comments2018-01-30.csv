43.0,"Today I was very low on energy.
Although doing yoga every day, I didn't do what I needed to do.
Through this journey I've learned that my regular yoga practice is just a part of taking care of myself.
It  makes me feel good and helps me feel better when I'm down.

However, it doesn't magically solve my problems. 
Positive self talk and the way I treat others are essentials too.
In addition, the mantra ""the breath always comes first"" is a golden rule.

Still,  I forget things.
I forget to take mantras off the yoga mat and I feel that something doesn't feel right.
Yet, it takes me some time to realise what exactly.
A lot of times I forget to breath.
I don't know why but my breath becomes very shallow.
That's when my brain believes that something isn't right and tension builds.

Still, I've learned those mantras and what's been learned once can be remembered. 
""What's been asleep can be waken up.""

Sometimes I forget that self care is an everyday act.
But today I was brave and took care of myself.
I surrendered and let go after holding on for too long...

...and it felt amazing.",UgykgBTzYTJ3SAzEYCp4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-09-09T07:38:48Z,-0.9733683466911316

Between tummy and thighs there isn't any room. I would need someone to push from behind to accomplish that.  I have been putting my arms between my legs to accomplish that but is that the correct thing to do?  Would it be better to keep correct positioning and leave arms on the outside of my legs but just grab my ankles? Eventually I will reach my feet ... I think eventually I will  lol.

123.0,"Today, practice felt absolutely great. I noticed some frustration and irritation I had towards myself and realized how I truly subconsciously project this onto my family and onto myself.
Lying in Savasana, realizing tomorrow will be the last day..it has come so soon!
I envisioned myself as who I was when I first started this journey 33 days ago (33 days because three days halfway in I was bed ridden with a cold)  but I remember the reason I started this whole journey.
Day 1 you asked us to ask ourselves why we‚Äôre here. Immediately I knew why I was showing up..
Self love.
Self confidence.
Strength in all aspects.
These past few years..when I honestly first started to practice yoga with you..have been so dark for me..so much releasing being done and so much light entering my heart.
I recently got out of a really beautiful and loving relationship..but there were somethings within our own selves that are desperately in the process of healing, which wouldn‚Äôt have been evident without the relationship.
But I was dependent on my happiness in this relationship..I was hurting so bad.
I remember the first couple of weeks in this yoga journey, i would show up on the mat and off the mat throughout my day..dark emotions and feelings came to the surface and during that time..I was SO scared it was never going to end. I was so scared that I wouldn‚Äôt overcome this tragic pain.
But here I am..day 29 and I feel refreshed. The deep pain I felt then has faded away and I didn‚Äôt even realize it until i stopped and realized all the beautiful work I have so far done for myself and will continue to create. I feel happy and in love with myself and my life and everything that makes up this entire YOUniverse.
Some days, of course I still feel sad..some days I am washed over with melancholy.
But when I allow rather than try to explain or make up a reason as to why I‚Äôm feeling natural human emotion.. I suffer LESS.
I‚Äôve become less controlling over my life and more allowing to let Source unfold my abundance right in front of me.
Thank you Adriene..I am so thankful for your role that you play in this world. You have always been such a great friend and I appreciate you. I wish I could hug you personally and tell you how much I love you!",UgyjpS-X_x0fQQsV9ep4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2018-11-10T18:21:29Z,0.9686828255653381

But yoga has given me a way to move, reflect and come to terms with everything that has happend over the past year.

181.0,"I'm sad to say tomorrow is my last day of this 30 day challenge. Have you ever considered doing a 60 or 90 day? Baby steps are always good but I was just remembering an old friend who was on a 90 day challenge. With her completion of that 90 day challenge was the inspiration I then received from her. It was awesome. She was beautiful and amazing for doing that. Today I can honestly find some sort of understanding that I didn't have then. I now have this deeper understanding for what she did. I would like to challenge myself to continue after these 30 days, to continue this journey and hopefully turn it into a daily routine. I'm left sitting here wondering if I can handle another 30 days in a row, I'd like to give it a whirl though. Anyway, One last question for you Adriene, What would you suggest for someone who is less than convinced that Yoga will help them? Is there a video suggestion you might have to offer? I believe Yoga would be so beneficial for my husband but I'm not sure which one to have him try, for him and not with me since he has done a few of the practices from this 30 day challenge but nothing for him. He has done Yoga before but I feel like he is hesitant to allow the process to work to its fullest and won't let down that wall. I was hoping you would have a practice suggestion that might help him clear his thoughts and figure out if this is right for him or not. I personally think it is but maybe he needs a different approach than I can figure out to offer. Thank you Adriene!",Ugx_sxljN2N5mYeL0Gt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-05-28T06:07:47Z,0.9946635961532593

I kept YWA in my weekly rotation several days a week until now where I reenergized myself this year. I find myself being stronger through these last 30 days because I now am able to complete the chatarunga (?) without collapsing on the mat. I am very excited about this. I still have so much to learn regarding the sequence of things. Andriene, I have sung your praises throughout my running circles so thank you. It was a runner that brought me to you.

This is yoga. 

As I am sure you have experienced by now, the practice doesn‚Äôt always align with your mood, your energy state or your schedule. 

However, you are always presented with this amazing opportunity to take advantage and really look in and see what is going on today  - or to simply sit out on the sidelines and ‚Äújust get through it.‚Äù
