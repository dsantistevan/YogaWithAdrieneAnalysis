Far more motivating than scrolling through pictures of that which makes up others. 

Remember your motive and enjoy as the rest begins to evolve and change. This session returns us back to that “beginners mind” inviting us to drop the poses, keep it soft and childlike.

What Adriene means: So just try and relax, yeah cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
'Cause let me tell you something little britches
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh
You're working too hard
And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
Then go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true
The bare necessities of life will come to you
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life
With just the bare necessities of life

I felt sad. I sobbed, shoot I'm still getting misty eyed.. but their childhood is not over, I can promise to make today and every day of the rest of their childhood more joyous and embrace those silly goofy moments even when we are out in public.

257.0,"Hey Adriene and friends! I need some advice. I was/have been experiencing some pain and discomfort lately, but especially in this practice. 

1) Knees—I don’t know if I need a thicker mat or what, but anytime I’m on my knees for too long (like half-plank) I feel like the bone in my knee is going to crumble on the hard surface. 

2) Inner hip-joints hurt in “happy baby.” I know it should be a good stretch, but it is not comfortable. It used to not bother me. 

3. Stomach on the floor during “rocking horse.” I felt like I had to hold my breath and flex my stomach muscles (which I know is not correct) to keep my stomach and ribs from hurting against the ground.

296.0,"Dear Adriene,

After doing the 30 days of yoga first and now I continued with True, with all the changes yoga has made into my life, it's a crime not to thank you for these videos. Thank you for changing my life! Thank you for being generous enough to share yoga in a not intimidating way. This is the first exercise I've done in my life which I look forward to doing every day and for the rest of my life, yes. It made me also love my body more and made me more patient in dealing with things. Yoga also healed me during times when I am broken. So, thank you very much and please continue doing what you do! All my love from the Philippines! 🇵🇭",Ugy8wdixK6mWJWP8_5p4AaABAg,0.0,8.0,2018-04-26T23:58:08Z,0.9997581839561462

418.0,"Thanks for the morning wake up.  i made an awesome recording, and when it is processed and packaged, it will be my understanding of whatever it is I have seen in this life with a theme of zen seen through death metal, and the screaming agony of man as everything seems to be going insane.  Your work helped guide me through the experience by teaching the body to anchor itself to reality regardless of what the mind is doing.  And that allows all that I have learned to spill forth and be redigested.  

So, this is my good morning, and thank you, and I hope you don't mind that I thanked you in the recording to.  Brought tears to me eyes it did to meet you and then boom I was in the wind as I began, and we returned to as we were before, and we both have changed, and little was needed from either of us to get the rest of the planet involved in making that happen.  

Ahaha,  so yeah, charisma is a good place to land here for egoproctor and death metal zen.  

Thank you ever so kindly for the gentle goddess drops as well, that brought the burden and fire and pain into focus again and I kept carrying on, and that will make sense in context with the recording.  

But here is my playlist that I meditated through and then used Alan Watts to discuss many of the implications in that music.

BUT, by allowing myself that rest time I was able to fully engage in this practice and get the most out of it today.  One thing I've learned over the years is that you have to listen to your body (and thank you Adriene for always reinforcing that!), otherwise you will be sorry.  I used to push myself so hard, even when I was injured.  It took awhile to realize I wasn't doing myself any favors by beating my body up.

821.0,"Thank you so much for going ""do the half plank"" to remind me that I don't have to go all out with yoga. Maybe one day I'll get to full plank, but giving a gentle reminder that we can do half plank helps so much. Also, no matter what I do, my lower back right above my hips is always tense and hurts after I get off the mat. I've put a pillow underneath my knees, used a yoga block as my pillow, but nothing was helping until today. When you said to come to any kind of seat at the end, I took a cross legged seat but then took a couple breaths to reach out with both hands in front of me for a gentle back stretch. When the video was over, I sat there with my hands palm up on my knees and bowed my head to my lap, which was also a very nice stretch. Both helped me to come off the mat without my back hurt / clenching and I just thought I would share the love / help. :)",UgylKVvjyMdIWwFDw1l4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-18T18:14:47Z,0.9838405251502991
