44.0,"If theres is ONLY ONE critique I have for adriene, it's that I wish the corpse pose was longer in the videos. I know she says we can stay longer if we have to. But I always end shen she ends, because I dont wanna get out of my corpse pose to pause the video and get back in it. And if I dont pause the video the next one plays and kind of messes wit the stillness. If she could have us wait there for like minute, i know it seems long I think It'd be beneficial. From what I know youre supposed to stay in corpse pose for a little while anyway. Even some mindfulness or tiny little meditation at the end would be super helpful.

98.0,this is the reason why I love TRUE. Did nearly that whole session with closed eyes. Still finding it hard to close eyes in tree pose but literally it felt super mindful to close my eyes during that sun salutation. My body is bigger then my mind. I often fear what I see when I close my eyes but once I find my light I'm safe. Brought out my owl spirit animal to guide me through those half way lifts with arms as wings. Was such a cool session today. Really enjoyed closing my eyes and travelling through the darkness of my mind with my light. My body listened and stepped up to the challenge.

It's a little annoying (and boring) to have to start at a beginners level each time, when you're more experienced in yoga and you want more challenge. And yes, you could say that this annoyance is part of your yoga challenge :), but it's also my body saying: more please. It's just a great feeling when you can suddenly do a harder pose like crow or wheel and really get into the detail of it, but not everybody can do that.

290.0,"Hi Adriene! I found your channel and True a week ago, when I typed ""yoga lessons"" in the search bar, determined to find something new and fun. I then went and decided to try this 30 days journey, albeit late. By the end of day 1 I felt really good, I liked it, but I felt a little awkward because I had never tried yoga and I didn't know how it exactly worked or the positions. However as the days went by, I was more confident and I noticed things went on fluidly! I literally fell in love with yoga! It is a relaxing practice, yet challenging when it needs to be (earlier I laughed hard and I felt in my abs the effects of yesterday's practice üòÇ). Every day, when I bring my thumbs on my third eye and whisper ""Namaste"", I feel a wave of pisitivity and I can't help but smile wide!
I wanted to thank you for your videos and for what you're doing, you're a wonderful guide during all exercises and I often find myself closing my eyes during the practice, as I tend to relax more, and you make it possible because your instructions are so clear and complete, even for those whose first language is not English, like me! I've never really been one to exercise every single day, but I like this series so much, and I find it so funny and healthy that I enjoy every single practice, and I always tend to think by the end of the video ""Is this over already?"" because it feels like minutes, when it's actually been half an hour! And then I look forward to the next day!
So again, thank you so much for your hard work and for making yoga easy and fun for everyone! Also, I'm sorry for this long message, but you always send all of us so much positivity, I really wanted you to receive some as well! Much love from Italy! üòòüíñ",Ugyb9SM_ywK83GUpDBJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-05-15T14:51:36Z,0.9989334940910339

444.0,"By the end of this, my toast had changed - I say cheers to learning new things and coming this far - enjoying a flow yoga sequence for the first time in my life, and not being bothered by distractions!! There are many things I've already learned from you, but I'm thankful for these two today. I always preferred slow and careful pace, with the focus on breath and proper alignment, and more yin yoga style stretching. Flow made me feel I didn't have time to do the poses properly, and it felt rushed, and like I couldn't keep up, couldn't catch my breath let alone a wave :). 

You have made me LOVE the flow! I breathed and felt it today like never before. Also, my brother's dog joined me today and it made me smile and think of Benji! Whereas in the past I would feel I needed to find a time without interruptions to do yoga, it's so much nicer to accept the environment I'm in and work with it not against it!

I'm a 'lazy' exerciser but find your practices challenging without being frustrating or too difficult...which is why I haven't stuck with anything before.

Ive let my weight get the better of me before and let it stop me from going after so many great opportunities, but no more! The difference in my strength, confidence and trust (in myself and the Universe‚ù§) has been immense. I love yoga so much because the progress is evident. It shows me that we can do anything as long as we believe, give our time, energy and dedication, and get up our ass and do the work! Just think of the possibilities what else we can achieve in life.

579.0,"AS I had promised myself, I was going to do the planking through out because the previous day, I didn't have it in me to do it and I only wished I didn't challenge myself because I could not believe how many planks we did in the session.  I got to the point where I wasn't counting.

Usually, I find myself a step or two behind, but through Kindle, I found that I was moving at such a slow pace (or Adriene was in overdrive through out).  I was in a good place throughout but I just kept on thinking that I was falling further and further behind but I didn't give up and switch off, I continued and as always after the session, I feel as though this journey is benefiting me in some way.

I am having such a hard time with my wellbeing that I am just looking for ways to calm down and relax and I find when I am going through these motions, I am feel as though I am in a good place.  I am even taking the time to mediate afterwards, even if it is for five extra minutes where I lay on the floor, close my eyes and just breathe and allow for the session to sink in.

I can't believe a week is nearly gone and this journey has been such a good challenge for me at this time of the year.  It is summer (here in Australia) but this is just so gentle but at the same time challenging that I don't mind 30 minutes on the mat and doing something that I believe is benefiting me as I am trying to create inner peace in my world by doing this as a way of relaxing and unwinding as I have been having a terrible time of finding inner peace ... and I am always suffering from lack of sleep and a busy head instead of falling asleep at night ... and so coming to the mat for 30 minutes, makes me focus on the now ... and I only wished I could make it happen when I am wanting to go to sleep ... 

At the moment I am all over the place when it comes to my timing of switching on for this journey.  I am finding that I am doing sessions at night where I should be doing them in the morning ... and hopefully I can get myself back into a routine that really suits me before it is too late ...",Ugy7eL9rdmxSuQtz3Ex4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-10T12:20:52Z,0.9800375699996948

I am going on a cruise leaving this Sunday the 14th and I am not sure I will be able to have wifi or that if I do get wifi that it will be fast enough to download the videos to keep up while at sea. I am deff going to be doing yoga every day but would really like to keep up with your videos and not have to do them late when I get back. I was hoping maybe you could email me the days I will be missing (days13-20) so I can pre-download them before I get on board and keep up through the week.

900.0,"Wow. Today during the second round of the tree pose (on our right foot), I found myself in tears. In reflection on the why, I think it's because - (1) my counselor/therapist explained at the end of last week that she wanted me to re-take the myers briggs personality test, as she thought that when I initially took it three years ago that I had answered the questions based on who I thought I should be rather than on who I truly am. I re-took the test this weekend, and indeed my results came out differently. Today at the start of our practice I cheered on my mat to resting in and being who I TRUEly am. (2) I broke my right foot in July and have been working on recovering ever since, and have really been struggling to balance on that (my right) foot. My LAST physical therapy appointment is finally* tomorrow. Today during the tree pose, I really struggled on the left foot (in the first round of the pose) so when we switched to the right foot... I felt a twinge of doubt, knowing I'd struggle on my right foot even more, but trying to just be okay with it. I ended up being BETTER on my right foot! And then we were led to express ourselves - I lifted my hands to the air in praise, and felt the unexpected tears begin. It was really really neat.
