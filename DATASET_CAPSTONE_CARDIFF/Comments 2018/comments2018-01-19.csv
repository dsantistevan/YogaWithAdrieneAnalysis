157.0,"Today's intro reminded me of a conversation I had with some co-workers just last week. We were discussing giving our boss a massage coupon for her birthday and since I knew she went to yoga practice, I suggested something that would help her energy. The answer I got was ""She's doing powerful rocket yoga, I don't think energy matters."" 
And it made me so sad. So sad because I've come to the mat to find a place of calm and peace. Or breath and energy flowing like one. Yes, my body is changing, but that's a consequence of my practice not the sole focus of it. And to imagine people going to their mat just for the body-related goals makes me think they're missing so much more...

173.0,"I was getting really frustrated with this one because I kept falling over. I thought I couldn't do it so I left, and didn't come back for a few days to continue the journey. I didn't feel like continuing either. I started losing track because when I quitted on this episode, I thought I should quit at everything else I'm trying to do. Including projects I've been working on, trying new things, talking to more people, getting out more, being with my family, etc. And it got bad. But I came back to do it again, and I don't feel as stressed to do it perfectly. I feel better now, and I think I learned something from quitting this episode briefly. It sounds ridiculous; I'm pretty sure this episode has exposed a part of me I left undealt with though. I wasn't disciplined, and I didn't want to fail. I wanted it to be perfect, and the best I can make it. And I realize now that all things can't be perfect at the start, and that's okay. If I fail, I just need to get back at it even if it's the most tiring thing to do. And the next morning, it'll get easier.

183.0,"So after Day 17 of True being the worst yoga day ever for me, both physically and mentally ,and after having to sit out a day because after days 16 and 17 I had really wrenched my lower back and could barely bend over.., Day 18 has been somewhat of an epiphany (or surrender) for me.  I took my frustration and anger (yes it was full blown anger) after Day 17 and my day off to do some research into Yoga and atheism and how to connect the two   .  I also spent some time watching some videos of plus size gals like myself doing yoga and how they handled getting into those poses I just can't seem to get to.   First of all I realized, I don't have to be spiritual to do yoga.  When you start into the meditation speak or talk of the 3rd eye, I know it's okay to turn that off in my head and think of things that are meaningful to me instead.  For example, at the end of todays practice when you went to the third eye, I took my hands straight up over my head pointed toward the sky, in honor of the star stuff I know we are made of (and a nod to NASA's Mars landing today).   When you speak of honoring the spiritual being inside ourselves, I have decided now I will be imagining the light of a million stars I know came before me and make up who I am :)   Also, I've realized (finally) there are a lot of people like me out there who can't transition from downward dog to a lunge smoothly or whatever pose we are trying to master, and that if I have to do it with blocks or even in 2 or 3 steps instead of one...that's frickin okay.   If I never get to where I can do a certain move, who cares, I'll do the best I can or a modification that works for me.    I really did surrender today and I didn't force a single thing... and you know what?  I did everything you asked and it wasn't a struggle (not to say it was easy...lol).   Sure, I had to put my other foot down when doing a side plank, but I did it!  If I don't ever get comfortable not putting that second foot down....I don't care anymore (doesnt mean i wont keep trying, though).  I do me, not you or anyone else.  I'm so naturally competitive but today I surrendered that!  Wow...best yoga practice yet for me.  I hope I can keep up this feeling but for today I really did surrender and let go...and believe me...that's one of the hardest things in the world for me to do.    I""m proud of me!

214.0,"I must say I am extremely disappointed with today's video. ""Today‚Äôs message could just shift‚Ä¶ everything"". Well, the message you conveyed in today's video was that we should do yoga for weight loss and to ""tone"" our bodies. As someone who has been struggling with combining my disordered eating and exercise habits with my love for various forms of physical movement this is very triggering. I don't see what the point is of including these messages of weight loss and changing your body (for the better, your message clearly is) by making it smaller and lighter except for tapping into the extremely lucrative weight loss industry. If that's what you want to do, fine. But don't bea hypocrite hiding these messages in stories about something else.",UgyTNh95SXD5d6B5ru54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-08-24T18:47:38Z,-0.9290717244148254

I hope you get to read this and research more about it, as your words and actions affect many people, it would be amazing if more people could move away from fatphobic ideas and triggering language to make this community a more inclusive and safe space for more of us.

314.0,"Wise words... ""The transformation comes from your commitment to the self, not the other way around."" In life, you can be whatever you want, if you trust yourself and let your all worries surrender to the universe. You need to trust yourself and trust the universe, trust the process. 
I am so impressed by the power of yoga and the meaning of it. You learn about yourself, your strength, you discover your feelings, learn about life, and learn how your body works. I am so in love with the fact that nothing is separable. Your mind, your body, your beliefs and universe-the process itself is all packed together and if you understand it TRUEly, then the show starts, you just unlock your life.

356.0,"Hi Adriene. I want to say a huge thank you for these videos, especially this one.. It made me quite emotional! 
For years now I have been a regular gym goer,  weight lifting mainly. I've enjoyed it at times but mostly I find it a chore, always beating myself up when I haven't made a session,  continuing to assess myself daily in the mirror, wondering what my body would look like with a little tweak here or there. 
It was only through this yoga series that I am learning how important self love is. Since following this series I have hardly hit the gym at all, truthfully because I look forward to coming home and doing a yoga session with you each evening. It's given me a comparison and opened my eyes to a whole new world of self love. When you said in this video to love yourself and let the physique follow, not the other way around.. I got really emotional! For the first time in YEARS i am doing that, trusting myself, trusting your videos and absolutely loving the process .
Thank you so much for your help in my journey,  its been invaluable

381.0,"i must get real here, because this practise was challenging in so many ways. I started this journey not only to get my body going, but also to get my mental health on the right track again. However this practise kicked my but so hard, I got so angry at myself and the practise because I couldn't do the side planks, and that made me feel so weak, which again led me to attack my mind and my body. However I finished the video, but the anger is still blocking the flowing through my chakras. Maybe this is my bodys way to tell me that I need to surrender, and then again my mind, so used to the same self hatred through so many years, resisting this practise and the surrendering to the universe. Maybe through all this my mind, so reluctant to free me, has paradoxically made me understand that I need to surrender not just my body, but also my thoughts to the universe. I'm so sorry for this long rant, but I think I needed it for myself, to see that it wasn't me that was weak at all, it was something toxic inside me that needed to show itself, so that I can fully surrender.

405.0,"Perfect analogy of the difficulty of the season of surrender that I'm in in my real life. Surrender feels so irritating and frustrating and difficult and it feels like it would be so much easier to quit. A lot of the irritation in difficulty springs from feeling like I'm being forced to do something out of my control. And how weak I feel having to push through something I wasn't expecting to be so hard. At many points I just wanted sweet Adrienne to just SHUT UP and let me move onto something else....usually I love her so much but I just wanted to lie down. 
If I were to focus on how strong I feel and how far I've come throughout my previous practices instead, on how I've developed the strength and endurance required for this difficult and SHORT 22-min video, that would help me feel less frustrated and more empowered.

428.0,"It's funny how much ""things are as they should be"" ends up being true...
I fell behind for a few days and had been feeling a bit discouraged, particularly as I realized that even though I'd approached this journey thinking that I had no expectations of ""results"", somehow I did expect that my body would have changed more or gotten a bit stronger by now, particularly since the last couple practices kicked my butt hard.
Well if I hadn't fallen behind, this message wouldn't have hit me on the day I needed it most.  Surrendering my expectations was my intention I set at the beginning of this journey, and this brought me right back in line with that.  It's been awhile since I cried at the end of a practice, but I definitely did today.

I have to confess something :( I am 4 days behind (I had some job interviews and didn't have enough space for yoga. (literally, space probs :) )

Normally, normal me, would have quit already. But after 15 days milestone, this practice has started to change my body, soul and mind, all at the same time. And I told to myself on those days when I couldn't participate:

""It's ok. 

It's gonna be ok. If you feel energetic you may do two practices in one day and you may catch up and reach the finish line with Adriene.

But you know what? It's also ok if you don't finish it on time. Couple of days... It's not the end of the world. Just keep on doing it. Don't quit! Please... Just keep on doing it from the day you left off.""

And I did it.

I made it.

I am here.

I am back with you.

I sat in the departures area, opened up my laptop, and while frantically searching for the next flights out, an email pinged in the top right hand corner of my screen, ""True - Day 18 - Surrender"", from Adriene. Instantly, that word, ""surrender"", permeated my mind and a wave of calm washed over me. I was reminded to surrender to what is not in my control, ¬†surrender to what is meant to be, surrender to what is meant to happen... Important lessons that I've learned from you, Adriene, during my yoga practice. I remembered that all is well, it is not the end of the world, and everything will work out great. And it did!

Today, it clicked. It clicked before this practice even started. While I've always been an active/athletic person, and I've dabbled in yoga for years, and I started to practice with you more regularly starting this August, but this TRUE journey has been my first-ever (!) commitment to setting intentions and practicing daily. My original intention coming in was to work on my flexibility (much needed) and get stronger--but just as you said, the physical benefits of yoga have come secondhand to the spiritual benefits. Syncing up with my breath, clearing my head, connecting--all of that is the hard work, and I find myself now getting on my mat and feeling completely open: no hesitations or expectations, no thinking about the poses, just being and doing.

As I recovered and got better, I began to gain a bit of weight. I was just so glad I could finally eat and enjoy it. Eventually, I decided to be careful of what I ate, but even so I keep expanding. I eat (kind of) clean and I practice yoga everyday and even though I feel strong and healthy it is hard to detach myself from the fact that I am a lot heavier than what I used to consider ideal.
