13.0,"I started in mid-April, doing a flexibility and balance yoga a few times a week (I had peroneal tendon repair in Dec). Then, May 1, I started a different 30 day program with Adriene. June 1 I started this one. Yesterday should have been my 56th day of yoga, but I felt so horrible at dinner, I went to bed. Woke up this morning and my back was sore from being so long in bed. I decided to do yesterday's yoga, and worried it would be too intense, since day 24 had been so mild. It turned out, this was perfect and exactly what I needed. I will do the Day 26 one tonight. I never thought, at 50, that I would be doing this!!",Ugx5obhteMN0a8b998d4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-06-26T14:19:25Z,0.5033473968505859

41.0,"Seriously yoga is such a powerful tool to have, I was on day 24 two weeks ago then had a shift in energy due to catching feelings for someone who was in a relationship. The emotional shift i took made me reflect on how quickly you can not know parts of yourself emotionally sometimes. The 'crush' feelings were so immediate it took me by surprise. The person noticed my natural energy and i guess matched that in some ways though knew that we would only remain good friends. But the shift made me think about how you can read energy and connect though it can be the wrong time. Within that I knew I needed to return to yoga to make sense and also though i do little stretching throughout the day its not as getting on my mat to connect. So within dealing with calming my emotions I have been up and down 'food wise' and getting on the mat made me realise that it doesnt matter what i look like, my mat is there no matter what. Also getting back into yoga today was a blessing as i can feel my body aching if i dont do it for a while so its time to return and get back in tune with me. Thanks Adriene for taking that break with me and getting me back into my swing and riding the last leg of TRUE with me. Also listening to Ludovico Einaudi helps :) xx",UgxIj-YvyCNvCObFYLF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-07-05T15:49:41Z,0.9961094260215759

I'm a handsome muscled man, flexibel (like never before), my physical problems and dis-eases are gone. I'm strong, positief, energetic, I love my life now, I met very close friends and my future plans are bright and very hopeful. This is only a small part of the experience, so much things changed. I love Adriene with all my heart, she is my example and I have no words to thank her enough for what she did with me and my life. Thank you Adrien, there will come a day that I will thank you with abundance. I know I did it all myself, but you motivated me and you made this journey for me and a lot of other people.

200.0,"Thank you so much dear Adriene! I had an amazing energetic awakening during this practice, it was truly wonderful after this weird, moony week! Thank you, thank you, thank you for creating it. 

The day of the super blue blood moon I faced the strangest emotions, experiencing heightened anger, distress, sadness, hysteria, intense moments of love and gratitude and loss of appetite, all within a matter of hours. As well as this, I ran into insomnia; tossing and turning in my bed until 5 am. The insomnia continued for days. Little did I know, the moon/la luna/la lune embellished our upper atmosphere and may just have been part of the reason why I felt so unusual.

After this week and the full moon, this practice was huge release for me. The moon days brought me new feelings of pain, distress and following  feelings of self-discovery and development came & this yoga practice felt soooo connected and good. Some say the moon can bring a new ""electric"" feeling, one which I first experienced leaving work the other day after the supermoon day. And a feeling I get often while doing your yoga practices. An intense moment of gratitude came over me, stopping me in my tracks, and I started taking deep, calm breaths. Moonstruck. I put my hands to Namaste. Then my feet carried me home. 

Many women believe full moons and cycles are an incredibly powerful time, allowing for the acknowledgment and release of any bad energies or feelings. Whether it was the brightness of the sky or something more ethereal at work, the moon has a mystery surrounding it, and one in
which I endeavour to learn more. I was wondering, how was it for you?

242.0,this was an interesting practice for me.  I felt a little rush entering and had monkey mind at the start but was able to rein it in and get focused as we practiced. finished feeling better but again mentally unsettled to start can cause one to feel as if they are behind rushing to catch up not fully devoting the necessary energy into doing the flows correctly. It took a few minutes but after awhile I just started easing into the poses synchronizing my body movements with my breathing. Overall today's practice was good for me and the mat felt like home.
