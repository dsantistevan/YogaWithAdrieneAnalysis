This is my 4th 30 days with Adriene and I love every single minute I spend on my mat listening to adrien. You are inspiring and are truly helping me live a better life. I sincerely mean that !!

However, lately I’ve been struggling to get to the mat. 8 days since my last practice and before that I’ve struggled to string more than 3 or 4 consecutive days. It’s so strange that something I know I love and I know makes me feel better and some how I still choose to watch tv or YouTube rather than take 20-30 mins first to do my yoga... 

Anyway, random inner struggles story I guess hehe 

My plan is to re commit to myself and to what makes me happier. Yoga is definitely one of those things!

Cheers everyone.",UgyfazvQyu9cEJ5W7q54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-05-29T03:21:48Z,0.9992890357971191

77.0,"I do yoga in an EXTREMELY small space. Like, my mat takes up my ENTIRE floor, and almost doesn't fit. Also, the ""Top"" of my mat is actually the middle, since I have a loft bed and going to the top of my mat would end in a concussion. So, things like Warrior 3 are DIFFICULT. I spend so much time over analyzing just fitting my body in space that, in speedier practices like the one, by the time I've figured it out Adriene has moved three steps on. But I don't care. I make it work because I love yoga. Was today my most successful lesson? No. Did I still enjoy it?

144.0,"Getting a tiny bit better at faster flows. Awfully wobbly in the balances but did them. Was able to get into squats (not with heels down) and even froggie pose but with my bad knees I have to be very careful with that...it can get very painful. As for crow, Im  just not built for crow .lol.  Cant even get close.  But thats okay, its not something I feel I have to do. You guys fly, I will be doing something else until we all meet again in downward dog or meditation pose 😁. In order to keep my attitude good and from getting too discouraged,  ive learned i have to pick and choose my yoga goals, even if theyre as simple as being more steady in a balance or more still when needed.

I felt awkward  and very self conscious for some reason going up to the maintenance worker and asking him for this pool cleaner like device ( a net) for me to fish out the cotton swabs. I really wanted to clean up the pond and specifically get those cotton swabs out of the pond because there are turtles in there! Just like the straw movement I have heard that cotton swabs are also a harmful shape for the turtles if they come into contact with them.

254.0,"Can't believe I stuck through a program this long, I've NEVER done that before! I first tried yoga about 15 years ago, but never stuck to a regular practice. I noticed through this journey that a lot of that was because I was just not educated enough about it.. seeing it, as you said not to, as a workout or just a way to stretch. Two biggest things that changed in me is  1: I realized just how often I don't try a move or pose (and ""off the mat""!) because I keep saying ""I can't do that"" and just wait for the next move/thing to do. It was shocking really to suddenly realize how often I say it, and have been working on that immensely!   and 2: Yoga is about way more than I ever thought.. the peace of mind and connection to my body that I'm starting to feel has me addicted!   I know you hear these stories all the time, but just had to tell mine. The way you teach yoga, Adriene, makes me feel like it's something I can still do no matter my level of fitness or flexibility or spirituality, which got me to try this 30 day challenge in the first place! And here I am almost finished with it and ready to start the next one, feeling challenged and inspired and super grateful. <3",UgxPy-reTVaB_YoUXMx4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2018-04-05T18:32:26Z,0.6364495158195496

I could feel my body ""going into"" the crow pose, as if there exists a balance which I can tap into and feel in my body. I was so amazed by myself, but my arms are not strong yet, so I only lasted a couple of seconds, but I did feel the balance. My motive at first was peace, but after a couple of weeks I chose balance. It's so much better than wanting peace and forgetting about strife, especially that of others. I want to thank you again for introducing me to this wonderful philosophy that is yoga. During this session I experienced immense thankfulness, to you and to myself, actually, I feel so thankful to be alive in this cosmos today... it got very emotional. I also got the feeling as if I was thanking myself, or actually something was thanking me, for choosing to finally embark on the yoga journey.

381.0,"Oh how annoying for me!! I just wrote you this long heartfelt note about my (difficult and then self-discovery-recovered) experience with this exercise .... but it ended up posting under Gentle Yummy Yoga (Day 24 of 30 Days) and apparently there is no way in youtube comments to either copy comments or delete them. So that long, important to me anyway, comment will stay forever in the wrong place. And now the annoyance I managed with much effort to find a way to stave off has descended again. Adriene, if you see this comment and you have the time, I'd love to have you read my extended comment over there. But if you can't, suffice it to say that because this exercise was especially hard for me - a 65yo woman with MS, weak legs and poor balance - and I have begun to suspect that the last 10 days of TRUE, with their heavy emphasis on strong legs, high lunges, balancing, etc., are no longer benefitting my own legs and balance, I was instead forced to find my own way into this practice and, with all of the glorious tools I have learned after 3 yrs of YWA, I was able to do so and end with grace and that inner smile.

I really, really love your yoga videos, especially the TRUE series. It helps me to calm down and it's a great stress relief when school and life in general feels tough. There's just one thing that I would like to bring up: you sometimes say things like ""ladies and gentlemen"", ""boys and girls"", etc, which can lead to people on the non binary spectrum feeling excluded. If yoga is about accepting who your true self is, I think it would be good if you gave gender queer people some representation.

534.0,"Hi Adriene, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you so much for what you're doing. To be honest, the ""True"" sequence this year came at the perfect time for me, and I don't think I'd have been able to make it through this month without it. On January 11th, my Momma passed away from COPD/emphysema. I sat with her as she passed and watched the monitors show her brain activity for minutes after her lungs and hearts stopped. It solidified for me what I always inherently knew to be true, that our minds and bodies are two separate entities. The week after she passed, it was hard for me to take the time for yoga practice, and I fell a week behind. I finally got the nerve to get back to it, and one day did 3 practices because it just felt like what my body needed. Your commentary about self-love and taking the time to focus on our physical bodies and that connection has never come at a better time. It's helped solidify for me that my body is just a vessel, and I need to treat it with love and care, regardless of the other circumstances in my life. It's made me more aware of that connection and given me even more reassurance that I'll see my Momma in the spiritual world one day. I'm proud to say that I've caught up and will be finishing out the next two days of the journey with you guys. Again, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. With everything I've been through, you've changed my life, and now yoga is finally a permanent fixture in my daily routine.

But I have to ask: Is anyone else worried about the plant on the right (calathea, I think). Everyday I hope she's feeling better, but I don't see any improvements. Please, Adriene, let us know if she's ok! :D",UgyL0B0pD-kTXZmBdHt4AaABAg,1.0,4.0,2018-01-29T09:15:03Z,0.9819170832633972
