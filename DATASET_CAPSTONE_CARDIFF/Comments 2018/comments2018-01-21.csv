Infact 2 mins into the session and I wanted to give up. But as we progressed, I felt so good. Each muscle and joint was feeling better and amazing every passing minute.

151.0,"Hi Adriene! Comia Catcha from day 19 of the Catch a Wave June Calendar and I am so happy for this practice today because I believe that ut showed me that not all awakenings are harsh, rough on the physical body, hurtful to the mind and intense in feeling overall. I have had many awakenings this past year, many that hurt me at first and took a shock to my system both mentally and physically. The past is the last and I am indirectly thankful for them, even though I did feel hurt at the time. The reason why I continue with the practice is because it teaches me something new everyday, and I am so thankful for that. So today, I learned to embrace the small awakenings and to understand that your whole life does not have to change based off an awakening; that instead an awakening can show us how important it is to make small changes towards the positive future. Thank you as always, <3 Namaste <3",Ugx7pSKV96OUqyTd9zF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-06-20T04:22:14Z,0.9990352392196655
152.0,"Man I love True Tuesdays. The only time I had my eyes open during this practice was downward dog, otherwise my eyes were shut for all of the poses. Not sure why. But yesterday’s yoga practice was very raw for me, and very frustrated, so I think it was my body’s way of telling me to slow down and look inward to find the peace I needed to truly chillax and destress. That’s my theory anyway!!! But I feel I will always have a special connection with these videos, as they got me into yoga to begin with. Coming back to them is like going back to one of your old teachers. You know them and their methods so well, you could do one of their classes with your eyes shut. And that’s exactly what I did today.

187.0,Thanks so much Adriene. You give me permission to slow down and be. I'm so aware of the get up and go/get things done energy that I get stuck in a 'it's not enough/I'm not enough' mindset and I beat myself up. I'm trying to challenge myself to do this in the garden and not be concerned with what people think of me. I'm not thin and beautiful like you and I feel so judged for trying to love myself as I am.

188.0,"Wow Adriene, another amazing one for my back, shoulders & neck! Thank you thank you!

Idk if you'll remember, but back in June 2017 I commented on your ""Yoga for neck & shoulders"" when my husband was going through chemotherapy for his stage 4 stomach cancer. We had just moved to San Antonio from the PNW (since he wanted to be near his family) and when we passed through Austin I turned to him and was like ""Hey Adriene is here! You know..Yoga with Adriene.."" Lol Because we would do yoga together but only YWA. No other channel compares IMO; there is doing yoga with an instructor, than there is doing yoga with someone who makes it feel like you are doing yoga with a friend :)

If I  may request a yoga video so similar to this, if not exactly like this one (because this one just became my new favorite favorite) could you make this sequence but in a slower de-stress version, maybe targeted towards grieving?
OR BETTER YET: Can you PLEASE make a yoga sequence for grieving, or after loss? I keep forgetting to ask you & came up with the idea in the last months since my husband passed away in October. I have been carrying tension in my back, neck & shoulders so badly..tbh I havent found much that helps ease it other than herbal remedies that are not in GNC and it does not rid of every pain. Your videos help relax those muscles though and provide temporary relief and many other general obvious benefits <3 Thank you so much.

247.0,"What does it mean to be ""awake?"" To me, it means to have my body and my mind be congruent. Oftentimes, I have swirling thoughts and a feel as though I am watching my life rather than living it. I do not feel many emotions except for sadness. Not even fear or excitement. Just sadness. To be awake would mean to FEEL life thoroughly with my mind AND body. Not just living in my head with a numbness to the world. 

Thank you for this video. At the end, I felt at peace for some time. I felt like I was where I needed to be and felt a mind-body connection for a brief moment. Thank you ♥",UgzP7k3esd15Nh3t4pF4AaABAg,0.0,11.0,2018-02-04T14:46:17Z,0.9976365566253662

When I started this journey, ""restoration"" was the appealing word in the description. ""Reveal and uncover"" are the ones today.
So many things got revealed and uncovered. I am uncovering and revealing myself. Things happen EVERY DAY.
I found out that this journey will end on the day of a total full moon eclipse. It is a very rare event. And the good news is I am only one session behind now so I'll finish it with you on the day !
And I think you are ready for your next challenge : creating a yoga musical (loved the Thriller arms btw !) I'm in !

I still remember when I first started watching your videos around 2 years back. My heart was drawn towards yoga, and your videos made me more and more curious and kept me coming back.

422.0,"I thought this was such a good practice to move and treat my body very sweetly. Gently placing hands and toes, and not just slapping them down into a pose. I do wish some sections were a little more drawn out as taking my time to place my parts with care meant I was moving much slower. I was finding it, not difficult, but challenging moving in a way that was completely authentic while also not falling too far behind. Looking back, that challenge was good because it was really helping me find what it means to move true to myself. I was like, ""hey! Slow down! This feels good!"" I may not have had those thoughts if I had ample time to move and milk out every last drop of feel good. Either way, it was great, and I thank you for providing us with these tools so I can continue to learn how to move in a way that is uniquely me!",UgwbRswNBGvvKChmy1Z4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-21T22:06:45Z,0.999804675579071

I also meditate by using Headspace, which is a great platform in my opinion. Both really help me discover things about myself I never realized before. 
I can also say that living awake during the day feels amazing. When I go for walks I notice a lot more than before, like birds tweeting and distant sounds of cars and the sea.

536.0,"I've done Adriene's 30-days for three years now, and always get a little sad at Day 20 because it's almost over! The thing is, I live in Java but go back to Michigan every Christmas and New Year's to reconnect with family and friends. The 30 days helps to ground me through January when I'm in transition back to Java and having to say goodbye to family—dealing with the jetlag and actually frankly missing the purple-gray, snowy January in Michigan. I know I can do the 30 days, or any other series or program, throughout the whole year—and I do (I actually tend to do this sequence again about 6 times throughout the year!) but it's not the same as the simultaneous, community experience.
