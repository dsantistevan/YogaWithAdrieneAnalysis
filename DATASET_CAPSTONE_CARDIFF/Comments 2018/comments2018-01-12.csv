0.0,"On this TRUE 30 Day Journey, we have the opportunity to look at the current state of body and breath and create a practice that serves - not emulates. 

Happy exploring today! (It will breeze by like 5 min!)

You are doing great!!! You should feel so proud! THIS IS NO SMALL FEAT!


SUMMARY: You have an opportunity to really begin to create an experience that feels good for your body each time you step on the mat. 

I‚Äôll be there to guide you.

There are so many pointers and adjustments in these practices for other  things that could be problematic, and so many cues that if they are  difficult, then just  to return to sukasana, but it doesn't often happen in reverse..Maybe a suggestion at beginning of practice,to have things ready to asist, and then some time to use them, could make this, and any hip opening practice more inclusive.",UgxBItDONNKrFyLZuF94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-05-11T06:37:27Z,-0.994255006313324

Second question: is it normal that I'm not yet feeling the release in my back/neck/shoulders area that some people are feeling? In the first couple of days, my back felt even more sore/tight than usual. Could it be that I'm doing some poses wrong, or is my body only still getting used to yoga which I haven't really done before these eleven days?
