In every other fitness, running, HIIT, circuits I always expect to be better than last time and get annoyed if I can’t run faster, lift more, do more reps. With yoga I focus on how I feel today, if it’s a good day, then great. If it’s a hard day, then fine, that’s why they call it ‘practice’. I only expect that I will learn.

So I got to know yoga when I was about 12 (6 yrs ago), but until practising with you I haven't experienced the real power. First time I watched your video was two years ago, but I wasn't training daily. That came with high school stress. I have two months to graduate and my body has never been in bigger continuous stress before. Then I started this challenge and I literally feel how my body and soul strengthened.

""[This was] a wholly welcomed restorative practice to take it down a few gears. To which I kinda internally laughed when you posited, “Ah man, bummer! Because I have so much energy!“

(And I’m like, “girl, I needed this [invitation to slow tf down]” at all of these more chill/restorative practices. Let alone today [where I just did a butt-ton of jacks]. Pffft.)

So much to love here - nice and meditative. I particularly, and as usual, enjoyed doing the happy baby pose… I also found myself beginning to well up at the end though, when you said, “don’t be so hard on yourself.“

Favorite material. Hands down. ♡""",Ugyqb2-yfqd6hY74SJB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-30T03:54:11Z,0.9948093891143799

236.0,"Hi! 
My comitment at first was - i think i won't pursue but lets try. The thing is, i have tried it now everyday which means this mentally worked, to just try, no prestige, no ""i must - everything or nothing"" just try. The intention was to try with consistency love and I have done just that. It's been so great, sometimes its been the only pause of the day - which is a reminder to find more of that or as you would put it: ""to find what feels good"" 
Im still here, and it's been helping me a lot also the thought that what you struggle with on the mat is what you also struggle with in life - it makes me feel in control of my life cus on the mat i try and go through every ""obstacle/reaction"" all the time.
Just wanted to post a thank you to you adriene and everyone comenting - i always take a moment to read peoples coments. It makes me happy and makes me feel less alone. 
The last two, three days it's been a struggle with my mentality - i have feel blocked - but I will keep on trying - maybe and probably it's just a breaking point - a obstacle i will go through with my intention set on consistency and love. Cus im not used to practicing self love, and the brain just got to get just to it <3
Catching up with the good mood of body and soul. Anyway I had as motivation to leave a coment on a ""low"" feeling day. Felt good writing now, i got some perspective on it. 
I'm gonna keep on trying, we are incredible!
