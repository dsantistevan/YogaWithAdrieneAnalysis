0.0,"Pay attention to the way you move - not just in the poses but in the transitions as well. 

Circling back to the intention behind the movement will allow you to create a meaningful relationship with your body and breath both on and off your mat. 

For me, this type of work allows me to let go of stress, tension and worry. This ensures that I am not carrying around a bunch of weight I do not need to bear. 

Marry the strength with the grace…

the effort with the ease.

Have no idea if you actually answer q's here, but here it goes: I have so much tension in my a.. hrrm.. glutes and lower back due to over-arching my lower back (my absolutely not professional diagnos).

But, I just can't seem to do that without squeezing my butt cheeks together! I try and try to find the balance, but DUDE! Now the pain in my ass is real. I've been searching online and found the piriformis muscle which I think is the culprit hurting me rn.. Do you have anything to tell me regarding all this? Any tips on how to do the simple tree when your back looks like an old-timey-wimey river bend? An 'S'-shaped serpent? I of course know it should have a bend, but mine is wayy over. Anyway, thanks.

I cycle through the 30 day series, or if a Migraine attacks hits or a body part needs attention, I will use one of the videos that addresses it.  For me, it is your gentle, encouraging spirit, the obvious love and attention you put into each video and the length.  The 20 - 25 minute mark seems to be magic for me.  Some days I can only manage a few minutes and others I'm keen to go longer but you have so many in the 20 minute range.  I can stick with it and stay focused.

I really feel (within myself) why this 30 Day Challenge is called True 💖 
I didn't grow up with a great childhood; I felt like I lost a really big, essential part of my personality that I only barely recalled I was really young. 

When I started properly dedicating to this challenge, I was changing each day. I was basically growing, and finally feeling myself. 
Feeling what's actually True to myself. And myself is the bomb 😎😂💖
I just find it easier to connect to almost everything! And it's a gift and a half, I'll tell you 🙌🏾

Having her here today helped me to be more present and involved (even if I had to scoot her a few times). Both of these videos were fantastic! I feel more tranquil and light after doing these.

154.0,"I'm LOVING these! Adrienne, you've really helped me get back on a path. I smashed my femur last year, and now have a huge metal plate and pins in my leg which makes a lot of things very difficult - including bending my knee more than 90 degrees, which can make things tricky! I'd never have got back into yoga in a public place - just too hard to get my balance right, deal with what I can't do with one leg etc - but thanks to you, I've started the journey. For those wondering - no, it's not easy to do yoga with a compromised femur. But it feels fantastic to find a beginning again. Thanks Adrienne. Loads.

I turned this 20 min video into a 35 minute journey of allowing myself the patience and freedom to re-center mentally and physically.

201.0,"Hi Adriene!
I've been a big fan for a few years now. Your videos have helped me develop a regular yoga practice and honestly, it has helped me get though some of the hardest times in my life. So thank you so much for that and for your commitment to continuing to bring yoga and amazing teachings to people like you do! I do have one small critique or maybe more of a request. Often in your videos you say things like ""guys and girls"" or ""ladies and gentlemen"" or (as in this one) ""dudes and dudettes."" And while I appreciate the inclusivity, some people are still left out in those types of comments. People like me whose gender identity is non-binary, or other trans and genderqueer people who may be in transition or just don't identify with the idea of a gender binary. So I guess I was wondering if you could maybe change your language a little bit to be more inclusive of people who are somewhere other than male or female on the gender spectrum?

I want to say thank you for your videos and all that you do! I love your sense of humor and your energy. I've been practicing at home since 2010 and I found your channel about 3 years ago. Instantly, I knew that you were going to be my teacher from then on. 😊  I'm so happy that you have become very successful with your channel! (It makes total sense though because you are the bomb.) I can listen to your voice, get a good laugh and not necessarily have a need to look at the video every second, which is awesome and important with yoga!

I woke up horribly emotional, ended up in a ball crying. I didn't know what to do but then remembered that I just needed to get up and start doing something to get out of my funk. Just moving and doing something really helps me when I'm distraught. I have a regular routine now of morning activities. The first is always always yoga. Knowing that the first thing I would be doing is coming on the mat today, just to be gentle with myself and to release tension, soothed my soul.

This year, I'm sticking with it, and stepping on the mat honestly my favourite part of the day. But I'm a bit worried about what happens once TRUE is finished. The structure of one video per day really helped me to make yoga part of my daily routine. I'm afraid I'm going to lose this habit again. Fellow yogis, how will you go on in february, and the rest of the year? Any advice?",UgyPA9d2NvrEXRuGRpp4AaABAg,2.0,0.0,2018-01-22T14:47:04Z,-0.8055340051651001
