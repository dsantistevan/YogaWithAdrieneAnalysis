Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to identify them, so we hop on the mat, we move our body and then it‚Äôs revealed. 

All those who choosing to work for themselves instead of against, say I!

So while I'm not 100% doing great day in day out, I know that doing this daily practice has helped even if sometimes I feel like it hasn't.

191.0,"I missed my yoga practice everyday! I‚Äôve been in some intense studying trying to make it through school (there‚Äôs literally about 2 tests every week now üòí) so I‚Äôve been trying to satisfy myself with the 5 minute yoga practice when I couldn‚Äôt do this. (It‚Äôs better than doing nothing, I think, but this is what makes my body feel better). I finally got into a twist today too! I struggled to hold it while breathing deeply, but it‚Äôs the beginning of being able to really cleanse my body. I went through a lot of detoxing with a recent bug I picked up, so I‚Äôm still getting back to normal, but a regular yoga practice helps with draining. 

Tidbit: I‚Äôve recently seen a few surgeries that I thought could have been avoided. This yoga practice is specifically for detox, but I think yoga in general helps with this. We give our bodies oxygen, assist with venous return blood flow, massaging the internal organs, gently stretch the skeletal muscles... and for some reason, where the mind goes, energy flows, so when we ‚Äúbreathe into‚Äù a body part, our attention is there, along with the caring thoughts, and this is so beneficial to us. The time we take on the mat really is for us, and goes a long way in our health and well being. I would say I‚Äôm gonna stop preaching but.... that wouldn‚Äôt be true, lol.

240.0,"I guess this is where I forgive myself. Which is funny, because it's been about 2 weeks since day 9 for me, but still, I've come to realize that even when, of course, it's most beneficial to go through those practices day by day, there's actually no ""failing"" at this. I was trying out a few of those day-by-day yoga practices and always getting angry with myself for ""dropping out"" for whatever reason - be it travelling, tiredness, laziness or being too hungover (hey - it happens) and starting again and getting even more irritated. But I guess this is where I drop this self-hating habit just because I don't need it. Even more, I don't deserve it. I start to believe that every time I show up for myself - it's good. Whether it's been a day or 10 since the last time, it's always good. And I start dropping my weight-related obsession, too. Not compeletely, I'm not going to fool myself, but I tell you what. I've spent my last week in the mountains, in the cold rainy forest, living in a tent. There were no mirrors obviously, and I had one outfit for the whole week to keep me warm, almost no contact with the civilization besides people coming and going along the trail and very little hygiene to be true. And somewhere along, I just stopped obsessively thinking about how I look. It just seemed so irrelevant in those woods and I felt free from my hateful thoughts. So I decided to cultivate, to practice this freedom. And I also believe that yoga is a practice of freedom. Training and stretching your body while merging your body with the mind creates calmness and there's no better way to freedom then by calmness, or so I decided to believe for now. And if it's hard sometimes, it's not punishment by any means. It's a way. It's all good.

Loving this series as always. 
My greatest challenge just now is when we are to step or hop our way to the top of the mat from a downward dog, or when I am to bring one leg up to my hands to prepare for a lunge/stretch. I feel like I can‚Äôt get my feet near my hands because my belly is in the way! - I don‚Äôt know whether that is actually due to a lack of strength in my hip flexors ( because I can flatten my belly to my thighs in other positions and movements) - what is the best way to improve my movement here?

574.0,"Busy day, and we almost gave up on doing this one. I saw the words ""work out"" in your email and suggested doing one of your super-short ones instead (so as not to break the habit) and being a day behind for the rest of it. That's what we were going to do, and then, at the last second, I said, ""Let's just do it. We can do variations if we need to."" 

Well I don't know what I was afraid of. We both owned these twists, and afterward I still felt good enough to do a Cosmic Kids Yoga with my 3yo as well, by her request after watching Mama and Dada do yoga together (we always tell her she can join in; hoping by the end of the month she does!)

My husband said this is his favorite one so far!

772.0,"Adriene! I feel that something profound happened to me through your lesson. I felt unusually apt to all of the ansanas today, normally i always have some form of mental resistance which I see as part of the practice/lesson, learning to let go of this resistance. Anyway, right at the end as I was laying in corpse pose and just as I was bringing my prayer hands up to my third eye I had a such a strong feeling, it reminded me of the first time I went travelling and was on a plane to Australia, I felt so vibrant and free! Like the world and Universe was full of so many possibilities just waiting for me to pick. This feeling filled my body with so much energy and at the same time my closed eyes welled up with the beginning of tears. It was so lovely! I thought I went through what some might call a spiritual awakening a few years but this felt different and really really awesome!

 Thank YOU for spreading your light around the Universe!

Thanks to you now I‚Äôm able to enjoy the time that I spend to be the better version of myself and I‚Äôm happy to do yoga even though sometimes I lose my balance or can‚Äôt catch the moves. You taught me to do whatever feels good and right to me and my body. Looking forward to finish this challenge. You‚Äôre adorable, thanks for sharing your knowledge and time.
