I had a best friend who would say that when life would get challenging and I'd start to get tense.. ""Be easy, boo.""  Your yoga is a great reminder of that.

But today, after 2 weeks of smiling of the mat, of feeling liberated, every day a little more, you said something. Something about the dark and the light, and us staying in the middle. It resonated, and I crumbled. Last night, I wasn't feeling great, doubting myself and the purpose of my being. I wrote something that goes along these lines :""Sometimes, I so desperately want to end it all, and at the same time, I want to save myself, to look at the bright side. It keeps me still, in the middle, torn between two extremities.""

676.0,"Hi Adriene,

A lot of days it has been hard to keep up with this 30-day yoga practice; often I fit it in just before bed at night, reluctantly pushing myself to do the work. Often the style of yoga doesn't sync up with how I'm feeling that particular day, but I'm glad I'm still doing it. There have been a few days so far when your practice was just what I needed that day, and today was one of those days. Thank you for inspiring me to challenge myself to commit to daily body care. I'm looking forward to taking what I've learned in these 30 days and continuing to practice according to the type of yoga I need each day.

Namaste,

754.0,"I liked the idea of letting go, and to *release* that which is not serving  you. 
We get lost in the tension of our daily activities we do, school, college, work etc. sometimes it over consumes our energy, mind, and body, thats why we need a reminder every now and then to let go a little bit.

778.0,"I did my eyes closed during the entire beginning and end of today's practice because I trusted you enough to walk me through it. I feel a lot calmer doing that but I also wanted to answer about release. In thinking about what I need to release or let go from my life, as I'm a writer, I thought it was going to be one of my many projects that are in a process of editing / rewriting. However, as I deepened my breath and reflected, my mind came to a person I know who I used to be friends with and now all I see is a ball of bouncing negativity. I didn't come today thinking that would be my release, but as I think about it off the mat and how I tense even if she likes something of mine on Facebook, I have to let her go. I have to defriend, I have to take a step back, and let her go. Maybe one of these days, I'll want her back but I don't need that in my life right now. I beat myself and can be a bouncing ball of negativity all on my own sometimes and I don't need another person being it. So, in an odd sort of way, thank you for helping me find my release even though it's sort of bittersweet, it's better for me in the long run. <3",UgyYGvn9NuyOHgHBmMB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-23T19:43:59Z,0.9919328093528748

That's what I love about yoga. Moments like that don't happen every time but once in a while you do a pose or a combination of poses or a breathing technique that brings in something so deep, that somewhere deep inside me really needed to do that to let go or feel better about something. This sentence sounds so vague... but that's because I myself don't know why or how or what I needed to let go of... But subconsciously I guess I did. Yoga really is powerful.

The hummingbird pose was new to me but I was able to do it and it felt amazing!!!  I was trying to be in the moment and truly was, with the other new movement of bending then standing then swinging the arms to ""let it all go!"" and of course your lovely quirkiness made me laugh, but you know that just added release and happiness even more to the moment; I laughed throughout that whole segment and the swinging was just what my arms needed.

I have a question for the community and I‚Äôd love some feedback. I put off starting this thirty day yoga journey because I‚Äôve really been struggling with the idea that yoga is a form of cultural appropriation. What are your thoughts on this? How to you make your practice respectful to yoga‚Äôs roots and original practitioners?
Thanks in advance!
