0.0,"Hi!!!! The practice of simply being present on my mat offers me the tools to both accept where I am today and to be open.

Open to catching a new wave, a new break. 
Open to all possibilities. 
Open to forgiveness and healing.
Open to the fact that yes, those are your muscles showing up to say, ‚ÄúI got you and hello.‚Äù

It‚Äôs week two and today‚Äôs practice is designed to help keep you in the game. 

This is usually where the mind starts to want to let it go. 

Don‚Äôt toss in the TRUE towel!

Remember your motive. 

Your commitment to this regular time for yourself. 

Your mission to show up and circle back to what feels like the true bad ass you. 

What are you OPEN to today- tell me in one word (or more) below!",Ugx3gWygnlnBTcS9ped4AaABAg,56.0,358.0,2018-01-10T13:53:57Z,0.9117148518562317

I supported my knees with a towel while doing the high lunges.

And I'm also still figuring out how to NOT apply pressure on the wrists. So, if you could help, I'd be really grateful! (I'm just 23 years in age, just so you know that I don't have any health issues or stuff.)
Anyways, I love love love your channel and 30 days challenges! Please do keep posting. I'm already feeling the changes and strength in myself. And you're SO positive!

I never fully mastered tree pose and now I‚Äôll have to relearn it, lol. When I gained a lot of weight I had to do these same adjustments, so it didn‚Äôt take me long to figure out that it‚Äôs probably the same in reverse. It‚Äôs taken me TIME to get here and yoga has been a big part of that. Yoga has helped me so much and I notice more and more how much more I treat my body as a human being instead of as a machine. Weird but true. I would not see myself as an organic being, but now I find every opportunity to baby myself. This is my version of taking my practice into the world with me for right now.

299.0,"Today was pretty noteworthy for me. Towards the end, in the lunges, I noticed what has been hanging at the back of my mind for a little while now - there seems to be something blocking me from taking deep, full, nourishing breaths. Finally feeling courage to trust myself and find out what it is (all thanks to you btw!!!) I delved in and realised it was deep emotion. This might sound like gibberish but I could feel this wall of pent up emotion so clearly: anytime I was able to take a deeper breath, it felt like a sob, like something deep was loosening. Now, I don‚Äôt know what it means, but I‚Äôm going to trust my intuition and know that it‚Äôs good. I know you‚Äôll guide me through, and hopefully this unknown trauma that‚Äôs taken root in me will lessen and lessen until I can take big, buoyant breaths with no qualms at all.

My mom has heard me yammering non-stop about how much I love this practice and having Adriene to talk me/us through it. She has shown a TON of interest in getting involved. I'm not 'limiting' my beautiful, spirited mother for a moment. She is my absolute role model. Bless her, she is in her late 50's and a bigger gal. (Hey girl, me too no worries or pressures or rudeness so please don't think I am. I love her with all my heart!) I love how you, Adriene, are always reassuring the less-than-flexible of us that showing up is 110% of the process.¬†

To wrap up this incredible tl;dr, what is the best way to ease my mum into this? She's not as flexible as she used to be though she's a tough cookie. I don't want her to injure herself and her back after surgery a few years ago, and I want her healthy and happy and around for a super long time.

517.0,"""Be in the ocean, but learn to swim well"" The way you switched the flow of the beginning of this practice(from several minutes of allowing us to connect to the breath to immediately  throwing us into the deep end to see if we can swim) is a genius move. To challenge the way we all get into rigid patterns, to see how we respond to the unknown with our bodies and movement and our breath and thoughts...Much appreciated, friend. Today, I didn't swim as well as I have in other practices thus far, but I didn't drown. I may not have caught as many waves, but I was present and accepting of my shaking wobbling low lunges. And that, I am beginning to realize, is the yoga. Thanks, Adriene again for holding a huge mirror for us to look into. I was off balance in this class...which strangely made me find some sort of balance. Namaste üèÑ",UgyFRQTYVy-wQht2ZjN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-13T01:02:56Z,0.9976688027381897

531.0,"AFTER a very hot day (36C) and spending time at the pool, I came to the mat late in the night where I was feeling refreshed and completely relaxed and so it was nice to take this yoga session and move at a pace that was fitting to me although I did challenge myself on more than one occasion.

It is great to know that there is repetition through out this True Journey and so I am always up to the next challenge, especially if on day, I am struggling through the motions.  I know that the same poses will be popping up again.  

As I am lacking flexibility I am still trying to work out where I belong on the mat when pigeon comes up but last night, I took in a good back stretch that was so needed.  I love coming to the mat and participating and giving my everything but sometimes I feel as though I am in too deep but to me, I have accepted that I am not flexible and it is just nice to find 30 minutes in the day where you are not having to think about what is going on around you, you just focus on yourself.  

The day had been focusing on myself and spending at least four hours in the water while the sun beat down and then spending 30 minutes on the mat as a way of bringing the day to a close was something that I really needed.  I am still struggling with tiredness, but I feel as though I am completely stress free and feeling rejuvinated after winding up day 9 of open.  

I haven't quite worked out where this yoga journey is taking me but I am getting the place of knowing just how good it feels to make it to the mat and stay there and be in the present with no care in the world.  I actually breathe a deep breath before stepping on the mat as a way of saying ""I have arrived."" and then I am just following and focusing on what I can learn in a time span of 30 minutes.  

I am glad I have this routine in my daily life and thank you Adriene for these 30 day challenges to keep me motivated cause some times it is so easy to say, I won't do it today, I will do it tomorrow ... and for me, I do need that bit of push to say ""come on, it is only for 30 minutes, and you know you feel good afterwards"" ...",UgzQF2NiHy3luHlPEaR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-12T11:11:27Z,0.9760210514068604

649.0,"""All the way down, to Shavasana town!"" Lol I love your sense of humor Adriene! I feel like you give us all the serious benefits of yoga but in the most fun and light hearted way =)
Thanks for another great practice! For some reason a was weirdly a tiny bit emotional just reading today's email! And then my mind was probably way too open as it was wandering like crazy! But I guess we will always have practises like that and it's a good challenge to try and reign it in a bit. Thankfully you actually brought that up and reminded us to focus on breathing and being present! How do you do it.....your timing always amazes me! Lol
And this may be a small compliment but I love little reminders like ""claw through your fingers""! I have troubles with my wrists in certain poses and am guilty of not preventing that, pushing too hard, or just giving up. So your little reminders like that honestly make a big difference for me!

822.0,"Dear Adriene, it is only day nine, and yet I can already feel many different changes in my body. I am a student, which means that I spend most of my time sitting and crouching over at a desk, often in uncomfortable positions. I have always been aware that to sit that much, and to constantly bear a great deal of stress and pressures with exams and deadlines, makes my muscles tighter, and that I tend to clench on my jaws and my shoulders, but it is only since I have started the True journey with you that I can fully realize where and how I creat all this constant tension. I enjoy jogging very much, and I always thought that in order to release tensions jogging was the best option to come to, but you opened up to me a whole world of new possibilities. I believe as well in the connection of the body to the mind, the soul, and the heart, and I am beyond grateful to have found someone on the Internet (which is rich in extreme and potentially unhealthy fitness practices) who promotes such a balanced practice to stay ""fit"" not only physically, but also mentally! In order to honestly see how my mind and my body can actually change, I will not do any other kind of sport. I am very curious because in less than two weeks I feel stronger and lighter than I would have ever expected! I have decided to test myself through this journey, and I hope that once it will be (unfortunately) over I will still be able to stick with it (as you often say). Most importantly, this comment is to let you know that I appreciate your work and effort, and that I am very happy that you are doing this for people. You are a very generous person!
