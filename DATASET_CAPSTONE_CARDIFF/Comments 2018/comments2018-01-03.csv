Started January 2021 with a colleague who is also chained to her desk, to the shining screen, for hours at a time, at home, under lockdown in the UK. When we started I didn't really want more screen time and youtube yoga hasn't much appealed. But this has changed everything for me. Almost six months in and I feel incredible. I love just giving myself over to it and doing what I'm told (!). It's totally wonderful. Thank you so much Adriene. You've been such an important and caring daily companion during these times.

63.0,"It's funny, I had for some reason thought this was a new practice for the ny 2021 and just before doing the second video, found BREATH which is the new 30 day practise for this year in real time. 
So when I decided to keep going with this practise which felt good so far and she said 'Trust that you found this practise at the right time'  it really resonated with me. Trusting in myself and my circumstance(s) is one of my biggest challenges in general day to day life. 

Thank you Adrienne. I realised it was meant to happen this way so I have motivation to continue after this 30 day practise. 

Well done everybody for turning up. I'm looking forward to being part of this community.

232.0,"Adriene, 


I just want to take a moment to thank you, you yogic badass, you. 
You're my guru.


You have genuinely saved my life through these videos, and through your intuitive talks during practice and weekly love letters, I have gained more trust in myself than I ever thought imaginable, and I've learned that all I truly need resides within. I've been watching your videos since 2013 and cannot express how beneficial they have been to me over the years. During my eating disorder recovery, your videos kept me going. They have helped me to love myself again. My anxiety and depression have been at their worst this year, and I've been in a really low place for months, but I am reintroducing the (much needed) daily practice and am so incredibly ecstatic about it! For the month of May 2019, I am revisiting this TRUE 30 day yoga journey. Just got back from a run and finished one of your post run videos, and am looking forward to TRUE Day 2 for this lovely May 2nd. Progress is not linear, but the nectar is in the journey, in the ""falling off the horse"" as you would say. I hope one day I can thank you in person, it's insane the impact you've managed to have on so many lives given YWA is an online community. 


So in case you forgot, your vibes really are coming through. 


I can smell the fresh flowers you bring to my door.


I can feel the energy that unites this community.


And it motivates me each and every day.

It‚Äôs so scary to do something new where she‚Äôs concerned, but my gut instinct says this is the right thing to do. So I learned to trust, and continue to trust. We can‚Äôt have growth without a little upheaval sometimes. Instead of fighting against it, I‚Äôm just letting go and riding this wave.

331.0,"You're truly the best, Adriene! I struggle with anxiety, OCD, and depression. My therapist has been urging me to do yoga since I was 10 years old. I was never able to be mindful and peaceful enough to go through with it, though. I had a pretty bad experience with it in freshman year in P.E. class. The instructor was a bit psycho. She would always blast music through the small room when we wouldn't be quiet. üò∞ A bit counterintuitive, I'd say. üòÇ I've only been doing this journey with Adriene for a few days, and I already feel the wonderful effects. I'm generally more calm and centered during my day to day activities. I've also found it's a wonderful, relaxing way to get a good work out in. It's helped me be more in tune with my body as well. I'm definitely sticking with this program until the end, and I can't wait to see where it takes me. You are so kind and positive, Adriene. When you said, ""No toxic thoughts! Don't you dare!"" üòÇ That really rounded out the whole experience for me. I've been bullied and mentally abused, and I often find these recurring memories popping into my head and creating negativity inside of me when I'm in the middle of doing something else. When you said this, though, I realized that I hadn't had one toxic thought the whole practice. I was so happy. I was literally crying about some bad memories last night, but with just this one practice, I feel that it doesn't even matter anymore. It's over and done with.

346.0,"Thank you Adriene. I guess, I can't describe what I feel after these daily Yoga practices. You have changed my life for good. Before I came to know your yoga practices, I practiced yoga, but that was like 4-5 days in a row and then a month's rest, lazy me. But it's been two months and I haven't taken a break for even a single day. I don't know what's in there in your practices, whether it's you or your voice or Benji or your calm and smooth yoga styles, or your find what feels good, I don't know, but every morning first thing comes to my mind is yoga practice and that gives me a smile on my face. I look forward to everyday practice. It makes me feel alive. 
And one thing, I don't know why, but I feel proud in Warrior pose. That pose gives an amazing satisfaction and a feeling of proud, and even when my legs hurt, I smile during that pose. Well, this smile sticks to my face during the whole yoga. 
Today's practice was smooth and calm, just like its name Trust. 
And as usual, you are awesome. You thank us everyday that we take our time to practice, Just like that, after everyday practice, I thank you for you take your valuable time and bring videos for people like us. You think for us, you have made us connected to you, to yoga, to each other. You are a beautiful soul and an awesome human being. Thank you so much. Love ‚ù§‚ù§

 I started watching your videos when I was 21 and a goddam hot mess. I am now 24, have a 2 year old son named Ezra and started a career as a massage therapist.
The lessons and body awareness you teach gave me the foundation to be the intuitive bodyworker, free spirited mother and teacher I am today. I recommend your channel to every single one of my clients, because i know awareness and mindfulness are essential to healing. I really freakin hope my clients actually visit your channel!! lol! <3 
It's so funny, I have been watching your vids for years, a few times a week, but have never had the self discipline to even attempt a 30 day challenge. But I am here now, and I am really feeling your message. This practice is really starting to become a main focus of my life. I plan on continuing on to get my yoga teacher certification, and all kinds of other holistic training to fully immurse myself in this amazing world of unified self love and PLAY. <3
Thank you for giving me the power and control to change my life for the better. You are such an inspirational, powerful being.

MUCH LOVE <3

439.0,"Dear Adrienne, I have decided to start doing yoga after a long (winter) break. I got really excited that you've created this new 30 - Day series! I did my first session yesterday and... I just felt so happy! My body remembered how good it feels! And when I finished the song ""I can see clearly"" came on my playlist! How awesome is that? I went to the kitchen to reward myself with a nice cup of coffee, I felt warm floor under my feet, birds were singing and... I just felt so grateful! I caught myself hugging my coffee jar with a big smile on my face, haha. 
Then I woke up this morning (crazy 8 o'clock on Sunday!) and I have decided for the first in my life to the practice yoga first thing in the morning. I always feel SO stiff in the morning that I never thought it would be possible without pain. First of all I kind of enjoyed this groggy/sleepy feeling without many thoughts in my head, which helped me concentrate on my breath. And then... I just trusted myself, this new experience, my body, trusted you and went for it! It was amazing! I feel so happy and energised the whole day! I don't know if I can still do it in the morning during the work week but at least I know this is gonna be my weekend treat from now on! I just wanted to say big thank you. You are not only an amazing teacher but such a wonderful positive person! I wonder if you realise how many people get on this mat every day just because of you!

I had a suggestion. After I finish every video I just sit there and kind of sink in the amazing feeling of happiness and relaxation but after a few second the your closing music ends and the next video automatically starts and I have to reach for my laptand and put some relaxing music on and come back to the position and the feeling just goes away. So it would be great if you used the extended version of your intro song at the end so we could chill with it a bit or maybe you could put a relaxing music at the end.

713.0,"Thanks for these yoga videos. I was telling a friend how much I get out of them, then realized I should probably say so here, as well!

Even though some may consider these sessions ‚Äúeasy‚Äù, in that they‚Äôre refreshing without necessarily aiming to get people to sweat, you do a great job of making little comments that ensure proper technique and active engagement with every motion, which makes me get something out of even the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù movements that seemed trivial before. (This sort of attention to detail definitely doesn‚Äôt happen with every yoga instructor!) Movements that didn‚Äôt quite feel right or beneficial before now feel good/useful. And whether it‚Äôs related to your teaching or not I don‚Äôt know for sure, but I feel like my breathing is more in sync with the movements now; or rather, that I‚Äôm syncing movements with my breathing.

It sounds like she's trying too hard to make connections and tie in the concepts. The meditation bit has also gone a bit too far in left field for me as well.

It's not easy for me to trust people cause many times in my life I got hurt so hardly that I was thinking the pain would never stop. My wife is the person who teached me how to trust again. Had an hart workout today and after this I had to buy some food and things with my mom. As I came home there was a friend of my wife to visit us and this girl is very exhausting for me. So after this long day I was lazy and tired, not really wanted to do anything else than lay down on my couch but decided to trust the yoga to wash the things away I struggle with. Love the warrior two! It's one of my favourite yoga positions. After the video I feel better and I decided to be the real me doesn't mater how long it takes my friends or family to understand but I don't want to say things or do things anymore I don't really think or don't want to do just to make other people happy.

I was still in this rough place of anxiety and frustration when I woke up this morning, but I pushed through to get on my mat today, and am I grateful. 

To stop and trust ourselves, to feel and own where we are at, and to open up to the possibility that this is exactly what is right at this moment is a reminder I needed.

1144.0,"HAVING woken up with a headache, I spent a good part of the day laying low and trying to get rid of it but I kept on saying to myself, I need to somehow do day 2 of this new challenge, and so in the early evening, I went for my daily walk and then I went to the mat with the plan of making it through the session at my own pace.

I had the light switched off, and the ceiling fan going and with my eyes closed, I went through the motions of today's session.  It was really nice to be able to move at a slow and gentle pace through out the practice.  At times, you think that you can't keep up with the videos, but I found with Adriene, you can work at a slower pace than she does and you still meet in the middle so it is really nice to have Adriene as my guide on this yoga journey.

Today was all about trust ... Working through with my eyes closed, I placed a lot of trust into what was being said.  As I had mentioned in another postt Adriene is a wonderful guide when it comes to verbally explaining every pose (asana) as we flow through and I never find myself lost when I do open my eyes.  

With ""pigeon"", I would love to know another alternative we can do because I have yet to be able to accomplish this one and so when this came up, I found it was my time to tune into myself and let the motion go by, but it would be good keep moving or do something similiar, so any suggestions are most welcomed.

I found myself in a good place through out simply because I was working at my own pace and to my own rhythm and I kept myself moving, although at times throughout the day, I was thinking, ""how am I going to get through the day?""  It is nice to know that yoga puts me in a good place especially on days when I am feeling lethargic and lacking motivation.",UgxsIi4MaS6OEZi6uZF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-04T09:51:00Z,0.9899311065673828

Let's use left leg back and right foot folded in pigeon for this example.  (note that I know very little about yoga)
In the correct position, but I seem to have 2 VERY different options, depending on how I shift my weight.
I can either:
1. Sit on left hip, and my body is aligned fairly straight
or
2. Sit more on my right bun (which allows me to be more ""on the mat""), but my body is quite askew (bent to right of mat and not an aligned body)

Which would be more ""ideal"", if I have to choose one?
They are definitely different, but is one more like the eventual goal of pigeon?  I'm not sure what the pigeon is supposed to challenge or stretch, so maybe that info would be helpful?",Ugx5jGDPm1FX6Jp5n7V4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2018-01-04T04:39:55Z,-0.9940093755722046

1437.0,"This was a heartwarming practice for me. üòä
My grandmother always said to me ""trust yourself my darling, you can do everything what you want"" and my answer was always ""nah"" or ""sure"" or ""K"". I didn't know what does it really mean and maybe I didn't care too much about that... (What a big mistake) Now, she is gone and no one says that to me anymore. At the end, you see, she taught me somehow how to trust myself. Before every exam or something stressful like that I always think about her words. ""I trust myself, so I can do this."" And yes, it's working. This is a key of everything.
So almost after a year later, it was a little bit strange to hear ""trust yourself"" from someone again. This was really heartwarming, and I started to smile, even if I felt sad and I almost cried at that point as you said these words.

Sometimes we get too caught up in what one should or shouldn't be able to do with the condition that our body is in and today's yoga practice really helped to let that go.

Yes we may all do the same things, but if you really are not 'following your breathe' and doing it in your own way, you don't reap the same amount of satisfaction and enjoyment that others may get, because you aren't doing your own version of something. I think for me this linked in perfectly with the video today on trust, to have trust in yourself to do new things but also things that others do, but to always do it the way that feels right for you, and trusting that once you do that, you benefit so much more.

1521.0,So I did this practice in the after noon. Yesterday we found out that we are being kicked out of our friends place. We are staying on the couch right now. My boyfriend is an over the road truck driver but we came into toen because my grandma was put in hospice. A few days later his grandpa was put in hospice and passed away Christmas Eve. Life has not been kind to us. Yesterday we didn't know where we were gonna live. I found a homeless group because we live in the truck we are with out a place to call home. They are going to help us out for a week because they are limited on funds. He called this new company he will be working for (its a local job but they do over the road) they said that my Milo isn't allowed in the rooms they have but can send us over the road until we can afford our own place. And it pays more! I am TRUSTING that this is the path we need to take. I won't be here when my grandma passes away but i helped take care of her for 3 weeks and I am hoping she understands that I want nothing more then to stay but I don't have that option. I am heart broken but I am trusting. This yoga practice IS helping so I am trusting the journey and the plan. :) Namaste.,UgwhISlFxPwnd4tpLgd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-03T21:38:37Z,0.9303159713745117

2051.0,"Dear Adriene, 

I ""found"" you through a friend while sharing our first wellness-weekend together to celebrate 25 years of friendship. From that moment on, you have begun to change my life. I've just finished REVOLUTION and totally fell in love with you being you! So much you say resonates deeply inside me, makes me smile and I started to really appreciate my self, my body, my values. I can hardly remember when I did something just for myself ... But you made me show up everyday on my mat - excited & happy. And just when I thought I couldn't be more lucky for the gift that you are for me, all the others here in your community and the world ... the TRUE yoga journey started! So now I'm at day 2 and it's the second day I woke up from my own laughter because I had been dreaming of something fun. So good things are happening! When I began the journey in December I was feeling kind of lost and low in energy. Now I feel I have so much to thank for! And yes, I do trust you and know this is true: One doesn't need fixing. Everything is there. Just trust. Everything is as it should be. My motive was to find my inner strenght, I will now change it to: find my true self. So your series did find me at the right time when I needed it the most. I can't thank you enough for all that you give <3

Love & light for you always.¬†Happy new year everyone, namaste!",Ugycm12JrsWzH2hsywp4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2018-01-03T16:45:26Z,0.9996408224105835

I also noticed the tension in parts of my body more today but as the lesson progressed I felt less of the urge to do something about it like an extra stretch here and there.

2099.0,"Thank you so much Adriene for making all these videos. I discovered your channel about 2 years ago, but this is the first time that I'm trying to keep up with the challenge according to the correct schedule (earlier I finished 1 video a day and then an other the next day, but then it took days or weeks to get back on the mat, and it's weird because it's only hard to get on the mat, but after that it always feels so good). I've been taking other types of exercise for 8 years now, but yoga is something very different. I really appreciate the stretch and the meditation part of it, it helped me to kind of 'heal, reconstruct' or just strengthen the parts of my body that were kind of destroyed and neglected while doing the other sports or while sitting all day long or standing with the wrong core position. I think the best changes that I realized on my body that were brought by your videos were my shoulders and my feet. I would never stop the other sports I'm doing, but it's amazing how yoga can pair up with them and just make a whole together. I don't mind the spiritual part of it, I'm very open about other cultures or more precisely I'm very interested to know what belief or what kind of thinking can make others happier and more motivated in the every day life (or on the mat), so that maybe I can try those in my life too or just leave it to them and be glad that it makes them happy and respect it. I never tried to do other types of yoga or the classes of other yoga teachers, and I'm only doing it with your videos. You're very good at pointing out what could go wrong in each position, and it feels like I'm actually participating in real life! For me the most surprising thing about yoga was (and still is) that breathing can be hard! My back and core hurts just by breathing correctly and consciously, because my lungs and ribs are not used to it. It was life changing to realize how important the right breathing is, and how wrong I was doing it before for such a long time! I have a cat since summer, and sometimes she lies behind me, so I can watch her when I stretch, exactly like you did in the beginning of this video with Benji. Sometimes she attacks my hands or feet, or when I'm lying on the floor with closed eyes, she suddenly surprises me with a cold, wet nose or tickly whiskers on my face but maybe that's just her way of sharing the yoga experience with me. :D I'm also watching from Europe (Hungary), but I don't mind the upload schedule, we should just appreciate that it's free and great, and it's amazing and that Adriene puts so much energy, time and effort into this for us. I think if we really want to commit to this, we can also adjust our lives to it, and worst case just do the videos maybe one day later than the correct schedule. Thank you again Adriene and I wish everyone all the best on their yoga journey!",UgxtnhwMKuNzOgAKftB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-03T11:03:45Z,0.3604188574001083

I know that people in the community have to make their living too, so don't take it wrong people. It's just not everyone has the possibility to pay or like me have the time and the lack of yoga studios in the area you live in. Of course I take classes as soon as I have the oportunity ... but I'm so thankful for what you do.  I've beeen following you for years, but this is the first time I write a comment.... because I have a big issue with just the topic of today's pass ""Trust"" ... big issue for me, trusting is one of the hardest things for me to do, I'm better but still I have such a horrible time trying to trust people and myself. I always doubt and it creates  anxiety and fears.... I often hope for the worst so I'm prepared. I'm turning 40 this year and I want to trust myself that I am enough being a good mom (2boys-ice hockey mom= no time, no money, heheh, because my strength is kind of low rigth now, I've been battleling with loses all of my life, and the feeling of never being good enough. I work asa teacher in Sweden a job i stumble into, I was more into the  creative kind of branch, and I have to stop with what I loved the most to do, to make a living, and I like my job but it dries me out. I'm originally from Chile, so I've been around the globe a few time,  because I don't have roots, yoga has been a tool for me to ground myself in all places I've been to, I have a dad that at is late part of his life found yoga and I was a teenager back then and i didn't understood then the importance of being told about meditation and yoga, but it kind of stuck inside me, I've been always active but I dont have continuity, because life kind of  beat me down, but I hope now that I'm more mature and aware, I will  succeed ....
