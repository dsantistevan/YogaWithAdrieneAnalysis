We are a mix of 3 sister‚Äôs in law related through 3 familie branches 
We have now followed you in respectively 150 and 90 days of your lovely yoga practise üòä
In lack of exercising in these Corona times my sister in law in Scotland started our little Yogaclub by sending me this challenge of 30 days of yoga which of course I couldn‚Äôt resist. 
I don‚Äôt think I would have joined the the yoga class if it wasn‚Äôt for this little word ‚Äúchallenge‚ÄùüòèI just couldn‚Äôt say no to a challenge).

Beside from Your amazing yoga classes which we all 3 have become to love‚ù§Ô∏èwe now almost every day give each other just a little comment over the days session (and other stuffüòè) on a social platform. It‚Äôs like ‚Äújust checking in‚Äù about the practice of the day üåûit‚Äôs very nice.

104.0,"This program kicked me off on a journey for sure! I completed this and 3 other yoga programs this year (all yours!) and I can't begin to explain how much it has changed me!!! Physically (I'm developing abs!? ME?!), but mostly mentally and spiritually. I learned an important tool for my anxiety, depression, anger.. I've sharpened my discipline but have learned to be a lot kinder to myself at the same time. And there are at least 3 poses (crow is most important one!) that I used to shrug off as ""I can't do that one"" and wait for the next pose, but I think your most important lesson to me this year was to just try a little each day.. and it paid off incredibly! I've vowed to make it a motto of mine so I can further enjoy life, doing things I ""couldn't"" before. Going to be ""circling back"" to this program one more time to kick off an even better year!

And this is just after nearly two months of practice every day. Yoga is now my go-to exercise and I fit other exercise around Yoga, instead of the other way round. I'm determined to get to the end of True, but hope that this is just the start of my Yoga journey.

351.0,"Adriene, I am so grateful for the love and intention that is deliciously wrapped in everything you do! I discovered you a few years ago, when my soulmate, Paul, shared one of your videos with me. Formerly, I had a regular yoga practice, and I also regularly hiked, skied, snowshoed, and backpacked in Colorado's beloved Rocky Mountains. Then, several years of chronic grief, over losses of most of my family and many dear friends to death, triggered severe chronic pain, and deep sadness and despair. In 2015, Paul came into my life and so did YOU! It still took me awhile to fully embrace what you have to offer, as more tragic deaths occurred in my life, and it was hard to pull myself together. But for over a year now, I have been regularly practicing many of your yoga videos for chronic neck and back pain, fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression, and more. I do your yoga flows on my lunch breaks at work, and also at home. Your practice is a perfect complement to my other healing practices (meditation, acupuncture, 21st Century Energy Healing, Quantum Touch, Reiki, EFT, and counseling). As a result, this year, I feel the best I've felt in my life! While I still deal with some physical pain, and, yes, I still deeply miss my departed loved ones (I would love anything you have to offer to help release grief), I've set an intention that 2018 is my year to become my TRUE authentic self again. Then BOOM - out comes your announcement of the TRUE 30 Day Yoga Journey! I'M IN! Thank you so much for being part of my journey. Namaste...

I started doing yoga about twice a week two years ago and found your site last April, Adriene, and have been doing yoga with you almost daily since then.

I love how you share deeply and meaningfully, but still keep it fun and lighthearted and your explanations are so clear that I mostly don‚Äôt have to look at the video ( but I do, just for fun and to see Benjiüòä).

566.0,"hey Adriene, today I just want to tell you some things that come from my heart. I am an eighteen-year-old girl and I come from Italy (sorry for some mistakes)... I practise yoga thanks to your videos since December 2016 and I feel incredibly good, strong and happy. I deal with panic attacks and anxiety so often and I tried yoga to fight these problems I have. You really helped me because every time I feel stressed I watch one of your videos and then I feel peaceful and calm. This is the reason why I'm so excited for this New Year's journey. One suggestion: could you make also meditation videos? I'd love them!
Thanks so so so much Adriene, you changed my life!

574.0,"Artistic Dressage is a Facebook community of dressage riders inspired and led by Thomas and Shana Ritter.
They offer online courses to help riders around the world train their horses along the classical lines.
During one of the many discussions, we got to discussing what the riders do to make themselves more supple - it is no good suppling the horse and the rider is stiff and blocking him.

Soon we were discussing Yoga with Adrienne. üòÑ
I joined a year or so ago at a friends suggestion.
And when I raised it on the group it turns out Shana is a fan too!

Last night she came up with the idea of a pop up group for the month of January to get the Artistic Dressage members to try your TRUE 30 days of Yoga.

https://www.facebook.com/groups/TRUEyogawithartisticdressage/

Here is our group link.
We will be sharing your daily links to the daily practice and offering our riders support in the challenge.

It would be absolutely AWESOME if you would join our group with us, and see how many lives you will touch with your awesome practice!

We are all very excited to get started!",Ugx3eKK6vTabqBY8d014AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2017-12-31T07:27:42Z,0.6414000988006592

Thank you for all you do! <3 I'm excited to try the 30 day yoga challenge this January! I had quite a bad car accident this past October, and have been struggling with whiplash ever since. I'm doing massage, cupping, chiropractor and, physiotherapy to aid in healing, also trying lots of Arnica (both cream and homeopathic) as well as turmeric. I'm still struggling with quite a bit of pain on a daily basis. I am wondering if you could suggest any practices that would assist in my healing, and would potentially help with the pain from the whiplash injury.

I started in september doing your first yoga challenge and honestly, it opened up such a new world to me, I am so happy and overall proud of the person I grow into, thanks for helping me and guiding me in such a great direction!
Also I just started university again (I'm 22) and I haven't had such good grades since age 12 haha (3 A's and 1 B ain't to bad huh)  and I think that your guidance helped me to make me feel more confident in myself and actually believe in my abilities and girl, I'm slaying all those exams. thanks for being who you are and doing what you do!
