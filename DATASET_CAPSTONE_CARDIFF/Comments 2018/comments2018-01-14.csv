0.0,"HI EVERYONE! LUCKY DAY 13!

The idea is that we are coming into harmony with our true self. Not muscling our way to try to look like someone else!

Harmonizing with your true self is a practice.

How you deal with the things that push you, challenge you and throw you off balance - is the yoga.

How you handle ‚Äúthings‚Äù is a great reflection of your true self. 

How do you want to be?

How do you want to exist in this world?

***The world needs us strong and in harmony with our true self. ***

This global party is just getting started. Tomorrow is another restful day so do your best today and commit!",UgyW0xYjWhDEbbit9Nx4AaABAg,33.0,353.0,2018-01-14T13:02:45Z,0.9986050724983215

Anyways, here I'm, another year has passed and I used Yoga to do good to myself. I Started the year craving for hope and calm, did almost all of Pri Yoga's 30 day challenges and found Adriene in november.

I just loved your way, your calm voice and with you I started my own challenge: practice afeter breakfast, before work, in order to start my day in a calm, centered way. Instead of the anxious, stressed, sick person I've been the last years. It's working, and I'm happy that I keep jumping on the mat, that it is my time, my journey, my way to cure myself.

I did start going 3 times a week! I loved the practice I loved the yoga, but it was too much for me. I work full and I have a small business making homemade soaps etc. time was the problem.

387.0,"Ok, I finally decided to write something, after 13 days of challenge, after 6 months since I saw your channel for a first time. Adrienne, you appeared in a very special moment in my life, when I ended up in a small, english village, leaving all of my friends, town I knew and comfort zone behind, to start a new life. When I found a courage to start a relationship with myself. 2 years ago I fractured my spine while bouldering, I spent almost 8 months lying down in bed and since then there was no day without a pain. 6 months ago I found your video for low back pain and since then I started to practice this sequence on regular basis, with lots of ups and downs. Meanwhile I left the english village behind, I moved to another new for me town, but surrounded by people who truly care about me. I found it really hard because I was isolating myself for years, carrying that feeling of being useless and not good enough. I struggled with anxiety and panic attacks, but didn't stop fighting. Still practicing with you, helping my back and releasing my pain, I feel I finally do something good, just for myself - no one else. Something nice and kind, something what I can call a self care. 15 days ago I decided to start this 30 days challenge with you. I skipped 2 days and I then I found how hard it was for me to come back to that nice, easey, calm state of mind. It showed me what happens to me when I forget about myself. It showed me I need to do something good for myself EVERY SINGLE DAY. That everyday counts. That I don't want a break from myself. That I want to honor myself, nourish myself and love myself everyday. To take care of my body, so it can help me to achieve my goals and dreams I thought I don't have, or I lost. I was struggling after my accident, thinking about myself as a cripple, and now I feel I'm getting stronger and stronger, not only in a physical way, but also in that mindful way. I've been dealing with depression, eating disorders and self hatred for years and years, finding really difficult to start doing something, ending up moaning about how my life sucks and how I sucks. Now I feel I'm falling in love with myself more and more, as well as with yoga. I can't imagine a day without this simple act of self love. It means so much to me. I'm not a person who write comments really.. I want to say THANK YOU, thank you for being here, for inspiring, and for believing. You're incredible, as I am, and as all of the people here. Sending you lots of love and magic - can't wait for tomorrow. Namaste <3",Ugx663Pq-qBR_6bYn2d4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2018-12-23T13:39:36Z,0.26887197272887653

493.0,"I found myself crying on the mat today. I was doing the goddess pose, and I suddenly felt the need to cry and release all my pent-up energy and anger and I realized, it‚Äôs making me want to look deeper inside myself and free myself from the guilt, anger, and disappointment I have/had for not doing as well as I imagined in med school. The pose was difficult. It made my body tremble in muscles I probably haven‚Äôt even used for a long time, and it reminded me of the struggle of trying to study in med school. Adriene says that who we are and what we do on the mat is how we are in real life, and I only began to realize what she meant when I did that pose. I was having a hard time, even if I knew that I had to do this pose for my own good, and to achieve the goal of finishing the practice. But I was getting angry at my body for not being able to be okay with it, for trembling and having a hard time, and for not being able to do it correctly or achieve it as fast as I‚Äôd like it to. I was getting so mad at my body for not being fast enough to learn how to do something. I was judging myself for not being excellent at something I was still in the process of learning. And that‚Äôs when I started to cry. I realized that the goddess pose was the same as my med journey. I was giving myself so much shit FOR NOT BEING EXCELLENT AT SOMETHING I WAS STILL LEARNING. When in reality, everyone's a beginner at something and we really have to take off the pressure of trying to be perfect, and just enjoy and trust the process, trust in yourself, and show up. Just show up. Gosh, I went into the yoga practice not knowing what to expect, and I got so much out of it. We‚Äôre only near the halfway point; I can‚Äôt even imagine how it‚Äôll be like when we reach the end.",UgxNrAduF-2KSvYCML54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-07-17T08:06:48Z,-0.9679481983184814

497.0,"Hi Adriene,

I just want to thank you for your channel. It is the only yoga channel I have found that is easy to use (and incredibly well taught) that also ties in a strong message of love of self and the world. I, like you, am an actor and woke up today feeling incredibly demotivated due to a variety of factors including a difficult project, an absence of daily routine and structure, and the fact that I am experiencing a huge amount of change within my life at the moment. I also struggle on and off with self-esteem issues and a tendency to develop sometimes destructive habits. However, whenever I get on the mat and follow one of your videos I really do find a peace within myself that can sometimes feel very unobtainable. Today is a perfect example for me of how your videos and your work really has given me an invaluable change of perspective. The connection between the cultivation of an active, healthy, well supported, well rested and well loved body and how this is mirrored in the mind and the soul is becoming more and more fascinating and comforting to me. I don't think I've ever really understood or experienced what it is to 'be spiritual' but there is something about yoga and the specific way in which you teach and practise it that really does make me feel more awake to the life and power within my mind and my body and consequently the world around me. When I practise with your videos in the morning, it is almost inevitable that conversations with the people I engage with on that day feel more organic, less rushed and more enjoyable. I find myself listening more - to people and the world around me. I find myself loving myself and others more - and hating myself and others less. I find myself enjoying the work that needs to be done during the day. I find myself wanting to do things that my future self will thank me for whilst simultaneously feeling more comfortable to enjoy the moment and live in the present. I just want to put a message out there to say thank you to you because it seems unfathomable that you would never know how much yoga, and the way you have introduced in to me, has improved my life. What you do is genuinely exceptional, and spending a little bit of time with you and you videos everyday inspires me to be even a tenth of the philanthropist that you are. You really are awesome.

Thanks again Adriene,

Love Will x",UgyrUb51aVfyscPRSq54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2018-07-15T14:00:24Z,0.9966444969177246

And that message of loving yourself has really resonated with me. It's led me to a sugar strike and eating better and losing like I said 10-15 pounds. I did this practice again today and was amazed at how much easier it was to do. Keep at this guy's you can do it. You can do it. If I can do it you can do it.

569.0,"It's about time I acknowledged you for the difference you've made in my life. You inquired, so I'll share what I heard: I heard my breath and the fridge quietly switching on. I especially heard my lion's breath today: it was the most invigorating lion's breath yet in my three years of practicing yoga with the guidance of your videos. These videos have changed my life. I was born with mild scoliosis in my upper spine and have developed with quite a bit of asymmetry in my skeletal structure as a result. This has caused me moderate to severe pain in different parts of my body and has set me back in all of the many physical disciplines and hobbies I've taken up over the years. The practice of yoga has allowed me to build strength in a way that harmonizes with and heals my whole system, allowing me to continue the many activities which I enjoy, including dance, martial arts and a budding passion for playing piano! Yes, I've found and practiced your video on yoga for musicians. There is a level of health and a quality of life I have since practicing yoga every day that just wasn't there before, no matter how much I exercised and stretched. These videos have also inspired me to love the body I have. I had struggled with an eating disorder for about ten years and now I love food and I don't feel anxious to exercise: I exercise because it feels good. Thank you for making the practice of yoga accessible to people in this way. I haven't met you, but I love you for who you are in the world and for your contribution to people's lives. This is one of my favorite videos yet. <3",Ugw2GG32ma3zx0ANUWR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-05-25T07:24:52Z,0.9994186162948608

I was surprised and happy with my ability to stay focused and in the moment, as well as my reaction to the more difficult moments of this practice- sometimes I laughed, sometimes I remained calm, but I managed not to resort to hoping it would end/tensing up as I used to do so frequently.

It has been really tight for about a week, I've been trying to stretch always, and did the ""knocking on heaven's door"" today, but it hasn't stopped the sharp pain, so I didn't do the dips.

I dug deeper than I had ever before and kept going. 

I realized I had way more in me than I had ever thought and learned so much about me. That it is worth going the extra mile because I lust for life, the experience. I learn so much about myself everyday and when I feel like everything is falling apart, Yoga With Adriene is there to gently guide me back to my path and help me build everything back greater than before.

897.0,"Thanks Adriene, great reminder that I am going all of this because I sacrificed everything I am to understand Goddess Resurrection, which led to understanding that water is conscious and self organizing and is the system that makes nature work and that gives energy to the body.  Water is, to be simple and crass, the zen mind, the electromagnetic energy flowing up and down the spin and in a spiraling circuits around the spine are part of the entire energy field around the body, where memories are stored.  

It has been difficult  to process all this information into a useable format, and it is ongoing.  You new Yoga series TRUE is gentle and simple enough that my aching mind and body can recover from the tortures I have put them through in my life.  Especially the birthday/Solar Eclipse LSD and then a bicycle ride down to Austin and now delivering for Favor.  

I am burning it bright, and my hips are so tight I swear day 11 was like working with a bear trap or something, my legs just wouldn't open to save the colors in the rainbow.

You are funny, singing in the videos, making jokes and laughing at yourself, that's so damn lovely. My six-pack abs were hurting a bit but that's okay cause I know they get stronger.

Anyway, I got through today's session although I once again struggled through.  Some days, I do really well while other days I find them a struggle simply because I am still in the learning process but, I do try.

At the end I am also in a good place where I can say, ""I did something for me"".  As I keep on saying, I am really enjoying this journey although when I come to reflecting upon what I had done for the day or lessons learnt, I sometimes can't remember in full, but just stepping off the mat and feeling really good and fulfilled that I am on target with my dedication to this challenge is enough for me.

1545.0,"So, I'm going to do something that I don't think a lot of ppl do in this section: talk about the anger that flushed up in me during the end of this practice. Please bear with me.
My anger left as quickly as it came, but when our dear Adriene said 'one more on each side... then one more again...', I have no idea why, but I had a huge flush of anger and frustration. I wanted to swear HARD and get up off the mat. Well and truly, THAT was my impulse! It blindsided me! Just seconds before, I was literally laughing out loud while kicking my feet (another completely unexpected reaction, though a hell of a lot more fun).
I've learned enough to know that placing judgements on any feelings, especially negative ones, is not the best approach. But to notice it and question where it came from is a different thing. 
I wanted to share this with you all not to bring the mood down, or lay blame, or even really ask for opinions about what exactly that was about. I merely wanted to express my Truth and say that, even though I don't know where it came from or what its about, it came from somewhere, and that deserves to be heard.
I dunno... just thought I'd share that.
