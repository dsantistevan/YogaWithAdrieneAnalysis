103.0,"Hi Adriene, just wanted to tell you how grateful I am for you. I'm relatively young (22) but never really had much of a relationship with my body, it was there, sometimes i liked it, sometimes I hated it, most times I looked at it and never really could register that it was mine. I was just a brain in a vehicule.
Thanks to you I can breathe and know what it feels like to hear it flow everywhere. That stretching my body isn't a chore after a workout but actually me loving it and listening to each part of it.
This knowledge and realisation will follow me for the rest of my life, I really don't know how I can repay you haha
I also noticed that some practices I couldn't quiet my mind and listen to my body, and what helped my was journaling right before starting yoga.
So for anyone struggling with mind-chatter during practice, I really do advise to take 5 to 10min and just freeflow write everything that is going on in your mind. Doesn't have to make sense, just write it down. Once it's written it's purged out of your brain and you can meet your peaceful self on the mat.
Anyway, thank you Adriene. I would love to help you the same way you helped all of us. So if someday you need some sort of help, don't hesitate to reach out. You have, I think, the most grateful subscribers :)",UgxT_FCXJGaHExMfCyZ4AaABAg,0.0,5.0,2019-02-17T23:33:00Z,0.9984155893325806

I've tried to do other yoga videos where the instructor speaks and moves so quickly that I'm only focused on ""Where are we?! Crap, I messed that up!!!"" instead of getting pleasure or benefit from my time. So frustrating and NOT what yoga should be about. With today's practice I was instantly adding my own ""twist"" and smiling. Learning the moves, adding our own finesse (man, I miss that conditioner! ;D ) and smiling really set everything up perfectly. Thank you for making me feel like I can indeed ""keep up"" AND reap tons of benefits from a swift practice. I've followed you for years & this easily went in my favorites list. <3",UgyBSz88FORJ-D73TQV4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2018-08-06T14:28:51Z,0.9976075887680054

I have done a few yoga classes in studios that I found difficult at times and originally thought the practices in this journey were relatively ""easy"" compared to the classes I took in studio. I was taking this opportunity to learn how to do each pose slowly and properly and use this as a 30-day mental detox as well. I did not realize how much STRENGTH i have gained during this journey until this last boat pose!! I have NEVER been able to do that pose before due to weak abdominal and back muscles and this was the FIRST time I was able to actually do it and I was so shocked and happy. I had to pause the video and try again to make sure it was real and i was actually holding the pose cuz I couldn't believe it! haha so THANK you for this amazing journey and all your lessons, i never realized it would help me so much!

I don‚Äôt have much to ponder upon today honestly, so here goes nothing.

We all NEED to be *free* from the things the burdens us and serve us nothing but as source of negativity in our lives. Negativity, some of it, however, could turn into positivity. 
Such as a harsh experience/ lesson that may open your eyes in a way you would never achieve in a state of comfort. (Sorry shitty grammar, too lazy)

Since TRUE began, you've somehow taught me to completely connect and respect my body. My daily namaste has become a thankful prayer to God for the body I have, and I'm doing better with eating instead of starving it and exercising for 2 hours at a time to just burn calories.
