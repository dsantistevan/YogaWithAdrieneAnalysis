Today I fired up both the tablet and the phone so I would have more than one place to look. But I'm not quite ready to look away and trust myself. Which means I'm rarely looking forward or down or anywhere but sideways on the 30th day. Yikes. On the plus side, at age 70, I finally got one crow's foot off the ground.

The reason you've been following along these past 29 days with Adriene is so that you will have the tools and techniques you need to ""build your own"" yoga session. When you just let go of that negative voice inside you that says ""I can't do this without Adriene guiding me,"" or ""I hate this,"" you will find that you CAN do it! It doesn't matter if it's the most ""professional"" yoga session - it's what feels good for YOU. That's the idea, right? Find what feels good! Even if it's just you sitting still and quiet for 25 minutes, for some of us, that's enough of a practice because we so rarely get to do that. The poses don't matter as much as your attitude on (and off) the mat. Even if you feel silly, who cares? You know the poses by now. YOU CAN DO IT! Namaste to all of you! :)",UgzdGY0UFueb9sxSugN4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-12-29T18:45:19Z,-0.7435199022293091

194.0,"AMAZING! I've been doing home yoga with you since March 2020 and I have never been a ""yoga person"", I have been a macho ""lift heavy"" kinda guy. I wanted something different but I didn't know what it was...I just couldn't put my finger on it. I tried many things before finding Yoga. when I decided to give yoga a try, I watched other teachers and I felt as though I'd never be able to achieve the poses. NEVER. I just thought my body was different and I couldn't figure out how to get the mind body connection. Then I stumbled across your page and honestly, at first I thought it was kinda cheesy and not me at all, but I stuck with it because you're so funny and I didn't feel pressured...Here I am 6 months later still watching the videos. I even spent a month on the road traveling with my girlfriend across country and kept on it (even in our tiny Inn room in Vermont and all the air bnb's from CA to Maine) You're so wonderful at what you do, and I just want to say thank you. I haven't been proud of myself in this way in a very long time and i'm not ashamed to say that today I got a little choked up and emotional cause I made it so far.

Before this day I expected to follow along, but that the beginning, when Adriene said find what feels good, ai decided to be true to myself and do what felt good to my body.  So I started off with Adriene and went off to do my own thing.  At times we were doing similar poses and at times we were very different.  The best part: I found some poses that felt so amazing!  When I did the one legged tadasana (sic) I thought to myself: stay true.  And that helped my find my balance and connect to my breath.  Thaf was the most breathing I've ever done during yoga, and focusing on tbe breath makes a big difference in holding poses and finding balance.  Thank you Adriene for another wonderful 30 days!

263.0,Finally the cycle of journey is complete. Have had a tough past two weeks so my yoga and taking time for myself and not stretching myself too thin for others made my yoga take a side seat. However with the shift of energy I decided to finish what I started and complete my TRUE journey. So glad I did. Was such a great reset 29 and 30. My body always seizes up when I dont move it and I feel my back has been neglected. As I always say a happy back is a happy body. Everything feeds from your back. So going to restore my back and hope it forgives me for neglecting it. I'm sure it will. Thank you Adriene and Benji as always for these eye opening journeys.

Hello again :)
This officially marks my 90 days of yoga with you (after Home and Dedicate) and I couldn't be more grateful, this last one was particularly very emotional for me, I can't quite figure out why but, I've learned that I need to allow myself to feel this way, release it, and let it go. I'm still crying as I'm writing this, but I wanted to take a moment and thank you for existing and being the incredible person you are, thank you for always having our backs, and most importantly, thank you for teaching us how to take of ourselves the way it's meant to be.

That was 2 months ago, I did this every other day.. It WAS more like YOUR 60 DAYS YOGA JOURNEY üòÇ, now I am more flexible, very fit, I lost 11 kilos, I am 79.5.. My core muscles are great, I'm more balanced, Adriene my friend, you brightened everyother day through confinement for me here in France, things were tough.. So happy I found your channel, thanks for the work, the effort, the dedication, thanks for bengi too for being so patient, bless him..

Low and behold I enjoyed doing it, it wasn't easy at all, but it was fun. I am more stable on my feet, I am more toned I've lost 14 pounds, but 2 incredible things happened today. 1. You told me that you were taking you're mic off and do what feels good and I just did it, I could feel my body and work with it instead of against it. 2. I have finished 30 days of exercise and I have grown mentally as well as physically so much. Thank you thank you thank you.

440.0,Did this yoga journey last August and I loved it. I was injured with a sprained ankle and this helped me heal physically and I also gained mental strength. I currently have tennis elbow and I've been mindful of how I workout at the moment. I decided to do this journey again (knowing I'd have to modify where needed) as I felt like I wanted to find my truth again and I feel like I've learned so much more this time round and I noticeable felt the progress from last year both physically and mentally. It is this journey that made me fall in love with yoga and turn to a daily practice which I have continued to maintain bar the odd day or two. Thank you Adriene. Thank you for sharing your beautiful soul with the world and your beautiful way of teaching yoga that is so relatable. You have an amazing energy. You are a true inspiration.

488.0,"60 days of exercise! I'm so glad I chose to do yoga for it, and I'm so happy I found your channel!  I was inspired to do 60 days after watching a ""How a fitness trainer helps actors prepare for intense movies"" and almost every time he did it on a 60 day basis. I thought ""I haven't succeeded at keeping an exercise regimen since recovering from the ED, but I think I can now - and I really want to!"". (After a false start trying a different way of exercise) Dedicate was my first 30 and was so delightful and then I moved on to True! Today is a goal met for me and I'm so excited! 

My mom and I were talking recently about my 60 Day goal and why I chose yoga and how I unexpectedly saw some strength happening in my arms and she said she thought she had seen some composition changes. Then we kind of geeked out together about how good it was to do something not for the changes it brought but because it was good for us. And also this practice I can keep up and almost definitely not harm myself and we were both so excited about it. Thank you for helping me meet my goal and for inspiring me to treat myself well even when I don't think I've done well. I look forward to keeping up this practice with you and all the other yogis out there! :) <3 (Also, my dog seems to like yoga practice too!

I found True and told myself to just accept everything as it is. It wasn‚Äôt difficult at all to come to the mat everyday; I looked forward to it.

535.0,"Ok excuse my tears but i cried ??? When you started being emotional at the beggining ??
Haha
What I noticed is that at the 16min mark, I felt like checking the time, and in my head I went ""What ??? only at mid-point ? I feel like Im done here, god I will be bored"" and had the urge to stop and call it a day.
But that's when I told myself ""maybe take the remaining time to know why you are resisting this so much, even if you just sit for the next 15min"".
And sure enough, I sat for 15 seconds, looked at myself, and went ""Actually, a downward dog would feel nice right now"", and kept going to the point when the 31min weren't enough :)
It's been a little over two months of videos total that I've followed you, and today is a brand new lesson ! Whenever I feel like giving up something important, I am going to question why, right now, I am resisting this. It really isn't much but I'm sure it'll change my future.

But it took me all year (2018).

544.0,"This was my second 30 days of yoga and this day is always so scary in the beginging. 

You feel tears start to well up when you begin in seated meditations but then as the poses start something the tears turn to laughs because your body magically knows what to do. 

You try the poses constatnly glancing to see if you are doing them right and then look away to try it by yourself and successfully begin to move into the next one as Adriene does and you feel TRUE (haha get it?) success!

Then comes the part where she slyly look at the camera and begins to do a pose that she murdered you in days ago but you laugh because it is like you shared a private joke. 

Next comes the part where you stay in child's pose too long and when you look up again she is in forward fold. It humbles you because you will forever have things to learn. 

Finally, it comes back and the flow begins, only to end abpruptly as the hands are placed on the head and you ""hear"" her say Namaste as you say it aloud. 

Thank you so much for these practices Adriene. We love you so much and you have taught us to always be true.

562.0,I got interested in yoga about 3 years ago. I look up a few poses and did them each night on and off for that period of my life. Then one of friends was having surgery on his foot that was going to put him pretty much bed ridden for almost a month. I told him I would do at least 20 minutes of yoga every day in the month of December. I wanted it to motivate him. I looked up yoga on YouTube for the 2nd time in my life and found you. I did a few random videos of yours and I was hooked. I started this 30 day journey not really knowing what to expect. It has changed my mind body and soul. I came into this 30 day journey thinking oh I'm a big strong man this isn't going to do anything for me. Wow I was so wrong. You introduced my body and mind to places I didn't know existed. I just want to say thank you for everything you do. I'm 34 days I think into my yoga journey. I'm going for 100 straight days. After that I'm going for 5 days a week.

583.0,"Adriene, 
I loved this so much!! TRUE has been a long journey for me, a year from beginning to end. At the beginning of this particular practice I was missing hearing your instructions, but then I realized that we'd already put this in practice, and that I could trust you and trust myself. This is the closest I've ever had to experiencing a self-practice yoga session, and it was so amazing! I think empowering is a good way to describe it.

That plus, when I recognized the music from the intros starting to play I started to cry grateful tears! Mostly because I realized I'd heard this intro SO MANY times before, and it clicked that every single one of those times lead me here to today. And also that throughout all the many stages of life in this past year I'd come to practice and I'd hear that little piece of uplifting music, never thinking there was more to it. But then today-- I got to hear the song build and become its familiar self and it was beautiful. I felt a connection there and I was overwhelmed with gratitude! This has felt like a graduation in a way. It was a powerful experience and meant a lot to me.

587.0,"This is my second time doing this 30 day challenge, and it looked so much different than the first. This time, I didn't do it continually - I got lost in life some days. But every time I came back to mat, Adriene validated me being there and it being exactly where I was supposed to be. Today, wow I needed this practice. I woke up with low energy, low to no self love, a negative view of myself and deep sadness. For the first few minutes of this practice, I bawled my eyes out and let out ugly but beautiful noises. Near the end, my giant, fluffy cat did a ridiculous stretch beside me, and I burst out laughing. I went through a list of everything I was grateful for in that moment. I'm still on my yoga mat basking in this love cave feel. I can't thank you enough for the love, care, gentleness and honesty you put into each and every practice. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

589.0,"That was so interesting for me. I started out thinking there was no way I could come up with 30 minutes on my own... but I did!   Every so often I would look at the screen and sometimes we would be doing the same thing and sometimes not. I worked on flows and poses I wanted to improve on and just kept flowing as best I could. If I got stuck, I always knew I could come back to mountain pose, take a few breaths and center myself,  release my shoulders,  and start again.   90 days of yoga practices done for me! Woohoo!  Tomorrow I will find another of your 30 day sets to start work on.   Thanks, girl,  for giving me something I can stick with and feel proud of.

I kept having back issues (I was doing a lot of Zumba at the time and I kept hurting my back and going to the chiropractor a expense that‚Äôs hard to afford) so I decided it was time to quit Zumba and focus on my back so I decided to do this challenge and my back and muscles feel great! I want to keep doing yoga maybe not every day but 2-3 times a week. Now I feel like a condition my body to be able to do other activities without injury. Also doing this challenge gave me an inner peace what I needed at the end of a turbulent year of divorce and becoming a single mom.

Then I get to the last video, excited at reaching the end of this series so that I can move onto more creative practice, and I find that there is no guidance from you other than watching you prance yourself around your yoga mat!? 
The whole reason I follow your videos is because watching triggers comparison and judgement in me and I appreciate the guidance through voice.
Now I have to watch you to know where I am at in the practice!?!? 
I came here to learn a new practice to grow myself, not to watch someone else exploit themselves. That is why I can't follow other 'yogis' and have never successfully practiced before.
I thought that was what this was -- until now.

But only this year, between Sept to Oct that I pushed myself hard and compassionately to show up to the mat regardless of my thoughts and my feelings.

Today as I completed ‚Äúbe you‚Äù, it was the first video of this series I‚Äôve done with my 2 & 4 year old with me and let me tell you, they helped me so much realize who part of me is. I actually was able to come into tree pose and warrior 3 for the first time! It was the best feeling ever and they were climbing all over my legs and back during the whole practice. I notice how focused and strong I could be with their added weight and energy. I‚Äôm super excited to start the revolution series next! Thank you again for being so amazing, inspiring, and you!

You've been such a positive influence in my life and I tell all my friends to watch your videos and practice with you, because I want them to feel the happiness and self trust I've come to feel as a result of being a part of your community for the last few years. I am not a particularly dedicated yogi, because I work 2 jobs and my life is more inconsistent than I would like it to be. Today, with your guidance and trust, I was able to come into a beautiful bakasana. I've done this pose before, but it would always result in me falling, or having to keep one toe on the ground, or I would hold my breath, but today was different. I breathed the entire time I held the pose, and my legs were right up in my arms where they should be which I've not been able to do up until now. My energy was flowing, I could feel the change in my body and I realized that I AM strong and I AM capable and it was such an emotional catharsis for me. I absolutely cried, because I felt so accomplished. It was an absolute milestone for me. You are such an inspiration, and you have been there for me even in the hardest days. Thank you, thank you. Please never stop spreading your light, you are so so special and you have changed so much for me. Namaste.",UgwHzgxUSNhF8P31ICt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-09-21T22:25:39Z,0.999394416809082

I have tried so many other ways to start caring for my body the way that it deserves and nothing has ever worked. I would start, but not be able to stick with it long enough because it just never felt right. I stopped looking at the scale and picking myself apart in a mirror. Instead of those things, I journaled after every practice. I can look back on those entries and see so much progress in the way that I practice, the thoughts that I had, and my willpower to care for myself. While I wasn't looking, I lost a noticeable amount of weight. This is without stepping on a scale or even staring intently at a mirror. I notice in the way that my clothes fit just a little bit better. This wasn't even about losing weight when I started, but taking care of my mind led to taking care of my body.

860.0,"Hey Adriene, I have started my Yoga journey recently and this series is what I have started with. I must say, because of your guidance the practice was made easier even for a beginner like me. You clearly explain every movement and any final pose is progressively built up from a basic pose. Eventually I learned to catch the flow of it and it felt wonderful. I noticed that I started smiling automatically while doing Yoga. I got eager and determined to get to my mat with each passing day, even when I wasn‚Äôt feeling well because I knew that I would feel better afterwards. And I was right! 
Today I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would be able to remember the poses on my own for the whole half an hour but I was pleasantly surprised. Every time I was doing a pose, I remembered the next one I would like to practise. The flow! yes, it was back. I was practising Pranayam as your video ended. Felt proud that my session lasted a bit longer than yours...haha! And still I could recall some poses that I hadn‚Äôt done today. 
So one thing is clear: Now I would be able to practise Yoga on my own even if I am unable to reach your videos. That‚Äôs the confidence I am finally taking with me on my journey ahead. Thank you so much...lots of love and admiration :)

In this last practice, although, everything change. Yesterday I felt a big open spin in my heart and remembered a time when i was young, confident and free-flowing. And felt it all day, dismising all other thoughts.
 But today practice was such a challengue, I didnt heard your voice as some people are claimming. I just didnt know what to do, so i just follow my body along the way. Some times I realiced I was following some voice in my head that takes me down, and some times the one that take me up... But I choose my body should choose the moves insted of them... I finished doing the crow for a few seconds, falling and laughing, and other times i also almost crying in the need of guidence... but at the end I just follow my body along the way, and I think this was feeling really good.

886.0,"I just want to be honest here. I really like your 30 day yoga, but I have to give all of them an A- Now this is why. You are really cute and have a nice sense humor, it's just that when you get to day 30 it is the same each time and it always brings me negative energy I have to stop the video and find another one of your yoga videos to follow. I feel that the we watch your videos for you to tell us what to do. You are the Boss(instructor/leader). I don't think we watch your videos to watch you do yoga. On day 30 which is supposed to be the special day you post a video of you with really nice music doing yoga. I do not understand how you are supposed to have a fluid flowing yoga session when we have to look up at the screen the whole time to see what you are doing, so every pose we do we technically are not doing it proper when we have to adjust to look up at the screen. If I can leave a suggestion. I would leave day 30 just the way it is, but for the audio could you please, please dub over your voice telling us what to do in the flow so that we can close our eyes and really get into the breath and into the poses and lose ourselves in the yoga. Please :)

Adriene again thank you, I have been following your videos for quite some time now (about 3-4 years now) and have been able to grow more, stretch my mind bar mental ilnesses and body, and own perception. it isnt easy and it is a PRACTICE which i try to make time for daily, but failing that, definitely almost daily, but it has taught me so much about my inner, my outer, my spirit, what it means to be me in my body and the slow growth through yoga and other exercise and in the 'exercise of self' and the truth and honesty I must hold within that.

I'm not gonna make any excuses, I fell out of it, got lazy, and just straight ignored the practice at times but I always went back to it because I knew how important it was for me. As a 240 pound man, I would be drenched in sweat after every practice but I showed up and did the poses as best as I could and kept going when I thought I had nothing left. 

I've been on the spiritual path for almost a decade now but this journey helped me grow exponentially. It was like I was walking lost in a fog and after finishing this, I nearly broke down in tears at the end of the video because the fog cleared and I found myself all along.

I promise to never lose sight of me and lose sight of being true from now on. I will continue to show up for myself on the mat and off the mat. From the bottom of my heart, deeply, and sincerely, I just want to thank you Adriene for being a guiding light for me.",UgzCcDdbqRXhmQvGQ014AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-06-12T04:40:43Z,0.99622642993927

944.0,"I finished the challenge today, took me 32 or 33 days. It's incredible the power of this journey!
It made me accept things as they are and not worry too much, to work with the problems that we got now, and not worry too much about the next minute or hour. 
I had to record some videos for my instagram influencer account and I had to sing, and yoga  has helped me with singing  for years. And my journey with singing has been hard. 
I've been through fights with people that hurted me and I thought were not supposed to, I got frustrated, I would beat myself up everyday (if I sand bad, I was a piece of shit, if I sang good, then it was what it was supposed to be, no congratulations for me, and I better get it right next time too), I looked for approval from others (cause I couldn't get it from myself) and even when they complimented me I wouldn't believe them. I would thing they were making fun of me or didn't know what they were saying... Yes, I was putting singing before myself. Singing before being, enjoying.
Around a year ago I started loosing creativity (which was always something natural in me) and I became really tired and didn't sing that much. I still tried because I was supposed to, but I couldn't because I was too tired of this.

At first I didn't like the idea of you not guiding us through this one, but then I realized it was about not expecting others to tell you what to do. So I started following you, but also kinda doing my thing. And it felt really good.

Today yoga wasn't about singing. This whole 30 days you made me do ssomething that wasn't for singing. I'm tearing up right now.
Today yoga was for and about myself. And I really needed that. 

So thank you so much for being yourself, you helped me be myself too, in a time where I really needed it. And I started to taste what loving myself felt like, when I really needed it. My journey to this point started a really long time ago, but this challenge really helped me establish the idea that it is okay. What's good, what's bad, what's meh or blah, all of those are okay. And I also learned other beautiful things with you.

I rewinded the video at the end to bow and I bowed to you. I started sheading tears at the end. Because I realized how much I have changed and how far I've come. I wouldn't have finished this in the past. And last year maybe I would've forced it.
But this time it felt really good. So thank you.
I bowed to you because I felt really grateful that you made this practice for us, and you were so soothing and positive and understanding the whole time. 

Thank you, lots of love in, namast√©.

I had to undergo surgery and could not move the foot for seven weeks. I only stopped moving around with crutches three weeks ago (which was when I was allowed to slowly start to put weight on the foot again) and today I decided it was time to finish my 30 days of 'True'.

1000.0,"my lovely Adriene, I am 24 and since I was 16 I had a love for yoga. back then I didn't know what I was doing and once I tried to copy a power yoga class I found online, failed miserably and quited. At 19 I joined a gym, I hated it at the most part but I loved going to yoga classes. I was terrible at it, 60year olds were flowing like the wind beside me and I was sweating like a pig just doing downward dog. Needless to say the instructor corrected every single pose I did, and mostly, downward dog. I loved yoga but it made me feel really insecure especially when the whole class had to stop until I got it right.so I stopped going. last year I went back. the instructor remembered me and considered me advanced so she pushed me to do a handstand(the whole class stopped again to watch me, and to my surprise I succeeded!), but as I was standing upside down a wave of panic washed over me and I fell and at that moment I realized I was doing it all wrong; yoga isn't supposed to give you panic attacks. so I stopped going, again, but the itch for yoga didn't go away. and then I found you, and this challenge. to be honest I didn't complete the challenge in a month (try two) because I missed days in between due to my terrible habit of quitting, but what I wanted to say is that for the first time, because of you, I took yoga seriously, learned to flow without worrying and did a yoga flow(this one) without someone constantly correcting me and telling me what to do(which is something I never dared  dream to try), and for just this once I didn't care that my downward dog isn't good; I enjoyed the process. and I have to thank solely you for that. with this long ass comment I commit to the universe to continue yoga no matter how, where or with whom. (P.S. I completed the challenge without owning a yoga mat, I used towels, beddings and blankets, but a yoga mat goes into my list). lots of love, namaste",Ugx60UmUM7kYxdgRwil4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-05-14T10:14:40Z,-0.8426668643951416

1011.0,"This is my 3rd 30 day challenge this year. I just have to speak up, this is the best thing I've ever done for myself. At the end of 2017 I felt I wanted to start my days mindfully and stop rushing away to work or training, not collecting myself and feeling what's up today. I had my ""own"" little flow through January but I felt lost and didn't know what to do. I had heard about Adriene so I found the original 30 day practice from jan 2015. I performed one session in the morning and one before bedtime, same session twice. I also felt I had trouble overeating before bedtime so I needed something to collect my thoughts at that time of day as well. It was A really good start with lots of yoga movements as you might want to expect of a yoga practice (which was good!!) I got really hooked and after 30 days I started another 30 day challenge doing 2 days in one day, one in the morning, the next in the evening and third next day and so on. Went to Thailand for 2,5 weeks and tried to keep going but it wasn't that easy as I thought. So getting back home I had really got off track which I felt. I was back rushing in the morning and eating at night. I decided to go for it again and found this 30day challenge. All I can say is during this time, and especially this 30 days I've increased my self love by 300 %. I have FELT the words that Adriene has spoken to me (us) and I've never been more happy with my self. THIS we call yoga or meditation och mindfullness - this makes me a better person towards me. And that makes me a better person towards everyone else. There are not enough words to describe how thankful I am to have this experience with myself, Al thanks to you Adriene.

1025.0,"Hi Adriene, I came across this 30 days of yoga back in April just to find myself a journey of exercising. I've been practicing yoga for more than 2 years but it was much harder and less thoughtful than your instructions (haha!). And actually when I started day 1, I was pretty overweight and feel bad about myself as well as my mental health was not in good condition. However, your TRUE journey brought me a totally different perspective about doing yoga. It's not about perfection (because literally back then the teacher was just doing her perfect posture and we devastated to catch her up), it's about Find What Feels Good - exactly what I realized today :) it was a long way to realize that though! And guess what, with lots of love in and lots of love out, I did my best to follow all 30 days and found myself well, a whole lot more core-strength coming up, and 2 kg went away (didn't expect that!)

I understood your purpose for doing so, but I was scared.  I started out trying to follow you, but I knew that was not your intent.  So I started to lead myself more.  I say more because I did look to you for reminders and guidance as I went.  That's where I'm at in my journey, a scaffolded we-do, working towards an independent I-do.

To make it shutup, to take my time, to keep going even though I was missing, slipping, falling.. Not just messing up in the poses but in life too, oh god I've messed up so much. But I feel like by this yoga practice, I've learnt to stop being so hard on myself, showing a little compassion. I kept coming back and I am so grateful to you Adriene, because you have helped me tap into something inside of myself that's to do with self love and compassion. Thank you. Thank you thank you a million times over. I've often thought about your journey and what brought you here- doing this. I feel like I am so grateful to all the things in your life that lead you here and all the times you stood up, and fought for yourself, for all the times you tried your best to be 100% authentically you.

1174.0,"Adriene I super love you and am SO grateful for this channel. I have watched you for years and recommended you to dozens of others. 
But I have to say how much I hate these silent videos!!! Why on earth do you do these? I only wish I weren‚Äôt so OCD as to have to finish all 30 days of 30 day yoga. 
Your silence gives us four options:1) Ignore the video and do our own thing. I do enjoy doing this sometimes, but why bother turning on YouTube for that?2) Watch the video but do nothing. (Or I guess theoretically there is a fifth option to watch the video to memorize it and do later.) Both options seem like a poor use of time. 3) Try to generally follow what you are doing but be in the moment. I am guessing this is what you think we are doing, but it makes the practice just a long series of terrible transitions and imbalance (catching the full warrior for my right leg but only a few seconds for my left, for example.) This is what I have done in the past and it is extremely unsatisfying. 4) Today I just kept my eyes on you the whole time while following what you did for the sake of balance and good transitions. This of course did not allow me to do any one posture correctly as my neck was always jacked to see what you were doing. 
If there is a good sixth option then please tell me, because all of the above options accomplish the exact opposite of what you have been trying to teach this whole time. 
So as to not waste (or leave as counterproductive) these last videos, you could publish alternate endings with you narrating what you are doing. That way I could complete each 30 day set feeling happy and proud of myself rather than imbalanced, with a jacked neck, and frustrated.",UgwPI9WjiW9P8kZJ2VR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-03-28T18:55:17Z,-0.9960936903953552

It has helped me so much and I can truly say I have fallen in love with the way yoga makes me feel. I thought at the beginning of this journey that if one thing changes physically and mentally, it would have been worth it. Mentally, I am able to come to yoga and release-find peace. Physically, I can comfortably let my legs fall flat after grabbing them and bending my head down. The 30 days spent with you has brought me joy. Some days were hard getting to my mat but I always felt amazing that I did. I wanted to cry hearing that the last song was the opening and closing to your videos and knowing the 30 days were over.

I tried to embrace it as a suggestion, to do what felt good to me, and it looked like a beautiful practice. I feel very sad that I didn‚Äôt even finish it, after 20 min I had a head ache and kept finding myself holding my breath. I love the idea of it but am sad i lost the flow my last practice.

I finally finished the 30 day yoga thing.

I became emotional at the beginning when you said you'd take the mic off & we would just go at our own pace, together, using what we've learned. It was like ""you've got this now."" The master handing over the temple key to the student.

& when that final song that's played at the end of each video began I was thinking ""hey, this sounds familiar...Is it? YES IT IS!"" & then the drop hits & I was like ""oh no she didn't!""

But you did. & that moment was the fulfillment of our 30 day practice for me.

I started with your 20 minute Beginner's sequence about a year ago now and am loving your videos and the gradual changes in me as a result, so thank-you for that too.

Today's silent movie took me by surprise and, being honest, I was disappointed - I missed your sense of humour more than anything, but found it was a far more disjointed practice for me  - made me realise I don't look at the video as often these days.

I very much appreciate the point of the difference - the quiet was good and I can see the benefits, but here's a suggestion for a slightly different take on the silent movie...how about when adding the music track in post-production, you add just one word directions for the next move or multiples of a move? So not the running commentary, but some audio direction.

Over time I found myself looking less and less on the screen and following your voice, which made this last day practice without voice instructions challenging. I didn't find it problematic in prior programs, may be because of a greater emphasis on lower-body asanas. It made me recall some of your faster pace videos in the past where voice instructions were taped in advance. This would have definitely made today's practice easier and more relaxing. ¬†

I have found through these 30 days, the pose that I love that releases all my stress is Standing Mountain pose to forward bend.

The first challenge (Yoga Camp) took me about 6 weeks, and on Day 30, I was filled with anxiety, continuously peeked at the screen, and ended up ending it early because I was unsure of how to guide myself and almost felt like a fraud pretending to know what I was doing. I started my second challenge (Revolution) about a week after because I wanted something to help me keep a somewhat consistent practice. By Day 30, I felt a little more brave and found my own flow for about 15 minutes, yet I'm not sure if I was listening to my body or just trying to remember flow sequences that I had done in the past. Today, I closed my eyes and practiced for the entire 30 minutes, and was surprised when the music stopped and the video ended. Something in my practice shifted during TRUE, and I can't thank you enough, Adriene, for being a patient, understanding, and consistent teacher throughout this process.

1686.0,"So happy to hear there is more to continue my journey. My professional career has left me disappointed and feeling stuck. True has allowed me the freedom and movement to find what serves me and to rid me of that which does not. While I enjoyed the strenuous physical challenge and the significant improvements in my comfort, flexibility and muscle tone the philosophy behind True really spoke to me and my current daily challenges. I end every practice with reminding myself to see the truth, speak the truth and feel truth. I found the daily pins to be especially enlightening.  

I got emotional during this last practice, in the video you smiled in a challenging plank pose and it reminded me to smile and at that moment I felt I was really practicing yoga with a best friend. I started laughing as I felt empowered and happy that I am and have actively pursued taking care of me, loving me for me faults and all. I started to get emotional at the reflection of what it means to commit to myself, something I have not always done. 
 
 The insight gained and difference in perspective from TRUE is what I found to be most gratifying about this challenge. And I am so proud of myself that I have completed 30 full days of daily yoga practice. Something I have been wanting to do since I began practicing yoga some five years ago. There were so many restrictions I was putting on my practice for it ""to count."" If it wasn't an hour long practice, in a peaceful distract free environment I felt I wasn't doing it right, or wasn't correctly practicing yoga and would constrict my practice only to when these conditions were met. I used to feel thrown off when I would get dog paws on my mat, reflecting back I was way to rigid with my practice. I had previously only experienced yoga through 60-90 minute paid classes at yoga studios. Where they have isolated peaceful practice areas, they spritz lavender over your face during corpse pose. This was the yoga experience I came to understand as how true yogi's practice true authentic yoga, or so I thought...

Watching YWA I saw a different way to practice yoga. I love that my dog comes on the mat now & I don't mind the foot prints anymore.  I no longer wait for peace to come before I seek yoga, I find peace away from distractions and noise through yoga and quieting the mind. In one video, you challenged us to pay attention to what we hear outside. You mentioned that you heard a siren outside your window. I found this ironic as this is the most cringe worthy opposite of peaceful sound one can think of.  You changed how I viewed what yoga is and means, yoga has as much power as you allow it to have.  For this change in mindset I am so grateful to what you have shared with all of us. There are perspectives, insights and new philosophies I have gained from the last 30 days that could have taken me a lifetime to notice had I not found YWA. You are truly an inspiration to me and I so appreciate you producing these videos for free as I am rich in spirit but not monetarily. I read through the comments after classes and feel I have found a community of my own. I can not thank you enough but I can say I feel love for you and I know what I'll do when judgement comes for me bum bum bom bom bom...:)",UgwFW5uSgziWj-h9MCB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-02-10T07:33:26Z,0.4386916830396238

1784.0,"Adriene, I don't often comment on here but I just had to say thank you for this video. I've been following YWA for 2 years now, and that's the first time I've really 'gone it alone' and listened to my body. I got really emotional right at the start, then I felt my body guiding me through the moves. My motto for True was 'love yourself', and I just felt this message emerging during the practice: to trust. I've struggled for years with trusting myself, and this is particularly relevant for me at this point in my life. I can't thank you enough for what YWA has done for my mental fortitude, grounding and confidence in the past two years, and today was a culmination of all of these things in seeing how far I've come. Keep doing what you do, keep changing lives. Thank you! So much love. Namaste ‚ô•",UgyhLYJ77vrjt5mDDMF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-02-06T22:43:10Z,0.9995098114013672

A friend said to me ""it's okay to be opened up"" and boy am I. Also the connection to the music from other January's that I've taken this journey with you made me so suddenly aware that I am TRUELY here again, another year of gratefulness and failing and growing and learning.

1920.0,"I'm a few days late to Day 30 and when I got here I was so scared and nervous at first, thinking ""What does she mean take the mic off???"" I went ahead in the video and my fear was confirmed: No Adriene's voice to guide me through this. I thought about skipping this and doing a different video for today, but then I read through the comments and began to understand. This practice is not about following along with Adriene--you're not supposed to take peeks at what she's doing and follow along. You're supposed to listen to your body, create your own ""yoga flow"" and ""find what feels good.""  I decided to be brave and fearless and aware and kind and... ME! I accepted the challenge and I'm so happy I did. I never would have thought I could do yoga without a guide. But I listened to what my body needed. I did all the warriors, I did back rolls, I did planks with hip dips!!! And I feel awesome! I feel empowered! My motive on day one was to get more in touch with myself. I am already pretty fit, but I don't know when to push myself and when to take breaks (both in life and in fitness). This practice forced me to listen to myself. I have already begun to achieve my goal.  I cannot thank you enough Adriene. There is a reason you have 3M subscribers--and it's not just cuz free yoga.

Anyways I wanted to ask a favor....I'm taking a yoga class and my teacher wants me to learn Sun Salutation 1 and 2.  We went over them in class, but I forget so easily and fast that a video would help me out a lot. So I wanted to ask if you haven't made a video tutorial for Sun salutation 1 and 2, can you can make one, if not that's ok. I understand that there are different Sun Salutations out there with different poses. So I could send you the poses and order their in.

Thank you not only for the powerful and moving yoga sessions but the emails that mirrored them. I looked forward to waking up to those sincere words each day. And I got a little teary on Day 30 as well. This isn't the end of anything though. I know yoga will guide me through the rest of my days. Thanks for the spirit you bring to the mat.

2036.0,"Thank you Adrienne for the 30 day yoga series. 
This was just what I needed going into this new year (and getting a year older). This is going to be a too long didn't read post but I will go on anyways :).
I did well up until the Day 14th. By well I mean I showed up, stayed the time, did my best to follow the techniques.
However, the scary flu this season did not spare me and I got really ill. I had to discontinue my practice few days then had to double up on some days. I had the flu ...from worst to still bad, for 3 weeks.
I finally managed to complete the 30th day this afternoon (Feb 1st). 
It would have been a shame to give up (as in I had really come this far and sometimes one NEEDs to finish what one has started for their own peace of mind).  So, I DID complete the 30 days challenge.
Here are few more (eye rolls**) things I  would like to share:
1. I did not, ever, get some of the poses right. And some days, I did not get the poses right which I did previously.
2. I never really achieved the balance (trembling legs up until the last day! :P). Will keep trying.
3. Bakashana (crow pose)... NOPE! Hope to get better at it.
4. Breathing... (ah well.. who knew I didn't know how to breathe!) I followed the pattern mostly, but sometimes.. well just went with it.
5. The sessions were consistently funny with silly pop culture references  and just the right amount of yogic vocabulary that I could follow. And I really appreciated Adrienne's pace, chilled tone and validation of how it is ok if some of us were struggling with some steps. I also kinda missed Benji when he/she wasn't there.
6. Finally, what next? Well there are loads of other videos on YwA channel and then.. yeah.. there's that crow pose to conquer.
Oh yes, I feel much better physically and I lost few pounds (although sickness and loss of appetite may also have contributed to the loss). Mentally or moodwise, I always thought it was a cliched thing people say but I do feel happier (if only because I followed through but I know it is more than that).

2069.0,"Adriene,
I cried through a majority of this practice, no particular rhyme or reason as I had just woken up, however, it felt SO healing in this context!

I cannot express my shear gratitude for putting these out and being such a calming presence with the lovely practices you provide; they are a big proponent to my healing journey.
So much so, in fact, you have helped give me the courage to sign up for yoga classes here in my city and double up with your at-home practices.

With what I have been experiencing, it has been a task to find joy in things and it brings me hope to know that I still can, I just have to keep exploring and realizing the light does not necessarily come right to me.
I have a difficult time staying consistent with things, but your 30 days was a surprise to me to be able to finish with such ease, especially when I was finding it difficult and uninspired to keep going with my body weight workouts.

I wish I was in Texas so we could be friends, 'cause you are the dog's boots.

Able to try and shift my mindset when the stresses of new places, people, or the heat began. I was able to roll out a towel and do a few stretches each day - and attend a magical yoga class in the jungle.

There probably are no words to fully express how much this has meant to me. And it couldn't have come at a more perfect time. Maybe any 30 day challenge would have helped me and daily yoga would always be so beneficial...but it's specifically doing this under your guidance that makes it all so special!! Your gift is so amazing and you were very much meant to do this...wow! I'm rarely proud of myself but shoot I'm just so proud right now!! ( as everyone else should be too!!) Ahhh WE DID IT!!! This last practice was really powerful. I always expect something new and special with each class (and you deliver) but I never expected you to turn the mic off! That was such a unique challenge and honestly a perfect ending! With the music and having to just trust my body when I couldn't see yours this practise almost felt like a dance. It was a really cool mix of trusting you and knowing you are there as well as everyone else doing this practise.....but also being really free and honoring that I can do this alone and took this journey just for me. I was already feeling some tears form just reading the email before this so then when that beautiful music started, omg I knew I was a goner...ha ha. But as sad as I was yesterday not wanted this to end I was pleasantly surprised they were very much happy tears today. I can't remember the last time I felt this good and I automatically broke into the hugest smile during Shavasana!!! =) And Benji.....the cutest yogi ever....I was super happy you decided to chill with us the whole practice!

And for sure I have felt it in this last day where tears came running down my face (though Im a hard cryer) but not so much because this wonderful True journey has come to an end instead something from inside came out, ignored emotions, hardships and forgetfulness for my own self that needs care and love. So Im am truly grateful for this practice you have shared with us and I can say that for myself it was amazing and it has brought yoga into my life as a daily practice not just as a sporadic one and there the miracle of yoga lies, in my opinion.

I cried as I began (standard for a 30th day, I think!) and tears poured out as I ended. It was like the trust in my ability to just get on with it had released so much pent-up emotion.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your guidance and wonderful energy.

I suffer from depression, and there have been days when this practice have literally saved me from a really dark episode. Even if it was to just turn up on this mat and fight the black dog (don't be scared Benji!) by sitting in child's pose, yoga has helped me.

Thank you for introducing me to a way of life that continually sustains, enlightens, energises and motivates me.

Not since last week, or since Day 1, but since last year's Yoga Revolution. I avoided Day 30 like it was the IRS last year and I knew I would not let it get to me this time around. Although I was dreading it, and although I was really unsure and thought I had no idea what I was doing...I did it. I moved with strength, with focus, with ease, and most importantly, with love. And as I ended this practice in tree pose, and as my hands met at my heart and traveled all the way to the third eye, I felt a very emotional release with that final 'Namaste'. I started crying not becuase I'm sad, or because this journey has 'ended' (though it hasn't), but because of the love I felt for my practice, my body, and you. Thank you for helping me rediscover that. It makes me happy that everyone else was just as emotional. Namaste! xoxo",Ugy61gLE9axKXl4ANWN4AaABAg,1.0,18.0,2018-02-01T07:29:17Z,0.9990454316139221

The music was gorgeous and I loved looking up at the video on occasion to find us doing different things or sometimes similar things (my favorite moment was peeking up just in time to catch you giving Benji some love).  I couldn't help but imagine all of us humans (and dogs and cats) all over the world weaving in and out of each other's flow.  Sometimes moving separately, sometimes in sync, but all as one - sharing the common goal of acknowledging our true selves.  This message was a gift to me.  Winter can be challenging.

It frustrated me to no end two years back because I was so used to being guided.. I felt I couldn't do it without looking at the video, which was true at that point... I have been doing yoga with you regularly since Yoga Camp. Today, the last day of TRUE, I was letting myself go slowly... My inhibitions and insecurities... And before I knew it, I built my own yoga flow and I would peek into the video now and then and realize that we were both at completely different flows... Both beautiful in it's own way.. met briefly in between for Surya Namaskar. And that is it.. And I was still on when the video got over.

Within the first few days of this challenge I loved it and could see the benefits it would bring to me. I was proud of each day completed. I was really looking forward to what day 30's video would bring. For a seasoned yogi a free un-instructed session is probably awesome. For a newbie like me - it was disappointing. I don't know enough yet to put the poses/moves together in a sequence and I can't see the computer screen when my head is upside down in downward dog.

I thought being out of shape, I'd start with a yoga routine instead of jumping into the gym, and it kicked my butt more than I expected it to. I've dropped about 10 lbs without much change to my diet, and my morning A1C numbers have been better, I've been sleeping better, and overall feel a lot better. In the beginning, some of the poses would cramp my feet because of the sciatica, but even that went almost completely away, and the poses became easier. Thanks for kicking my ass for a month. Thanks for all you do. I'm sure many many others along with myself greatly appreciate it. Stay beautiful, stay you.

2522.0,"Oh Adriene. Where do I begin?

I began this journey because I saw your video about it in my suggested feed towards the end of December, and decided I'd start and go along with it. I thought it'd be fun, and may be helpful. Boy was I in for a treat.

This journey has been the sole thing to truly help me overcome hurdles I've been stumbling over. I've struggled with anorexia for several years, and a few weeks back (right before beginning this journey) I was facing impending hospitalization for it.

This has been the first thing to really sink in for me. Learning the mind and body connection I've never had has nothing short of changed my life in one month. Most of the horrible demons have melted off my back. You taught me to trust myself. To love myself. To be myself.¬†

I have a long way to go, but this journey you've cultivated has entirely changed the game for me. You may have even saved my life, because I've never had this much desire to take care of myself and accept myself instead of starving and doing intense cardio. You've taught me how to find what feels good.¬†

I can't thank you enough. I'm so blessed to consider myself in your tribe now. TRUE has been my favorite part of every day, and I intend to continue using your practices every day. TRUE has been a therapeutic, healing process that's helped me progress in mentally fighting my disorder more than therapy has. I'm still not healthy, but TRUE has helped me correlate listening to my mind and body connection in other areas off the matt-- suddenly being able to fight the urges to over exercise, enjoying fruit again knowing that it's nourishing me just like TRUE is nourishing my soul, and showing me that the courage to fight has been inside all along. I don't have to go out like this. I can truly fight it off for good and have this be the year I find peace, maybe even a healthier weight later down the road, and so much more.

I'm not crying, you're crying.

Namaste, ¬†my friend.",UgyVYOeM94oobferjjp4AaABAg,0.0,3.0,2018-01-31T23:29:34Z,0.9972737431526184

Edit to add:
And now I'm crying reading everyone's comments!

My husband and I did this month together, after him seeing how much Adriene had helped me, physically and mentally, over the past year. It was incredible for us to practice together, to be vulnerable together in a new way, for me to be able to share something I love, to physically just take the time, for each other, for ourselves.

Thank you, Adriene. You have made us stronger, individually, and together.

My husband used to get anxiety at night, would get fixated on thoughts about death. He says this month has eliminated that anxiety, and that that is his favorite (of many) effects this month of yoga has had on him. He says instead of staying up in bed freaking out, he takes deep breaths and falls right asleep.

2770.0,"Hi Adriene and Benji! I've been leaving comments after doing each day's practice, and I had been thinking of what to say after day 30 - how to amp up my thanks to convey just how much this has all meant to me - and honestly, I can't even find the words to say what I want to say. I suffer from anxiety and depression and at the moment I can't work because things are so bad. I am isolated and very down on myself a lot of the time. Before starting this journey with you - and with the community - I didn't believe I could would be able to see it through. Frankly, I didn't believe I could do, or was worth, anything. 
This journey has honestly changed my life, and I'm sorry if it sounds dramatic, but it's true. I found a strength in myself I never knew I had, I found a silliness, I found a kindess, and most of all I found a voice - I found myself.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for everything you put into TRUE.
Love,

It feels like a year since then - my body is stronger, my posture taller, my breathing deeper and my state of being is more present.

The ability to spend a short and manageable amount of time working on my practice each day, as opposed to attempting multiple long classes each week at a studio has been a game changer. I absolutely love your style of teaching, the way the practice ebbed and flowed, and how just when I thought my body couldn't do another day, you would have something yummy and calming in store. I didn't manage to do every single day this month, but through this practice I have learned to be forgiving and to be grateful for the time I did spend on the mat. This was a perfect culmination of the thirty days too. I've always wanted to be able to flow through my own practice without guidance and always found myself thinking about too hard to be fully present. You've allowed it to become a part of me and I crave time when I can flow and listen to my body. Thank you for the opportunity to really start building a practice.

3006.0,"Feeling so much gratitude for this last month of practice! I began the year in a rough space and didn't think that I would have the courage to show up every single day on the mat to tend to and cultivate a new relationship with myself. Discovering that inner fire within me and knowing that I can and will show up for myself every day has been incredibly meaningful as I navigate the messy beginning of this year. Normally, I get really anxious and self-doubting at the end of each 30 day journey when I'm left to my own inner voice to guide the practice. However, today was different and I had the confidence, trust, and self-knowledge to do my own thing for once (as opposed to nervously trying to copy the video in silence and just getting frustrated). The results were amazing and I'm now feeling all the more empowered to continue my own home-yoga journey. I'm feeling so much overflowing gratitude for this series, this channel, yoga, myself, and life!

TRUE was the first yoga challenge I've ever committed to and actually finished, and the first challenge in general over the last few years that I've stuck to. I found that I NEED practicing in the morning. Not even want... need. Even if I don't want to do it, I make myself do it anyway and modify as needed. The days I start with yoga, I honestly notice a difference. So, this morning, I started day 1 of REVOLUTION. I'm excited to continue evolving with you over the next 31 days. I also learned to listen to my body and do what works for me. I, for one, find downward dog extremely uncomfortable so I've substituted with wide-leg child's pose and it honestly makes the entire yoga experience better. I also learned the value of accountability. Having a partner to tell you to ""do it anyway"" on the days you aren't inspired to get on the mat makes all the difference.

Thank you Adriene, these 30 day practices are an awakening and a reminder that I am exactly who I want and am meant to be. We all bring so much with us to the yoga mat, and it isn‚Äôt always as perfect or transformative as we maybe hope it will be but it is always beautiful and a chance to just take a moment to be precisely who we are in that moment.

3116.0,"Thank you Adriene for these past 30 days. spending time with you each morning has transformed my life. It has given me the strength to know my true self and to be kind to myself. If you said to me a year ago that I would be standing on one leg while bending forward with my hands out behind me and that I did that or something similar every day since July 15, I would have told you it was impossible. That I didn't have the balance, the focus, the strength- both physical and emotional, to do something like that.

I feel more open to myself, more self nurturing, more calm and more open to the experience of life <3. I missed days, but always tried to make them up. Even when I couldn't, I always always came back to this and was kind enough to show myself compassion. I learned to show up for myself more and more, and that setbacks are only so if you so intensely focus on the end goal, that you miss the beautiful moment that is.

I know it's not a competition but I wanted to challenge myself this year, to commit to the mat and to myself. I wouldn't be hard on myself if I would skip a day but somehow I've actually done it. I surprised myself. Coming to the mat was just a part of my day, like having breakfast or brushing my teeth. It was just part of the routine. Some days I would practice in the morning and other times in the afternoon or the evening. Somedays I got distracted a lot and other days I felt completely at peace. Yoga is good for the body but also for the soul. I want to try to stick to a daily yoga practice :)

You probably don't remember me, but you pinned a comment I put up on last year 30 days of yoga - about how I had been bed-bound at some points, and in a wheelchair at others and how amazing it was to be where I had got to. To add to that, I wanted to let you know that I had a DEXA scan (that's bone density) recently and my osteoporosis has significantly improved! The consultant couldn't believe it, as little else to do with my health has changed. But I told her that I do yoga at least once a day - and here is the truth that yoga can change your life.¬†
You, this community, and home practice have changed me. I am not the girl I was when I left hospital. And I am proud to say that I am allowed to go to my first public yoga class next week, although I will never give up my home practice.
Adriene, I don't think you'll ever understand how things have changed in my life because of you, but all I can say is thank you from the bottom of my heart. My heart to yours.

3418.0,"Adrienne, this has been such a positive experience and I can't thank you enough. Not only for producing great yoga-content, but also by making it free and accessible for everyone. It really has helped and inspired, not only me but so many others. It's sad to see the 30 days come to an end but I couldn't have asked for a better start to the year. This last practice almost had me in tears yet it has given me so much confidence and I honestly will carry that throughout my day. Yoga With Adrienne you're a star. Thanks Again. p.s.What's the music in this video called?",Ugy5XcSVkYbCmZykyGJ4AaABAg,2.0,31.0,2018-01-31T08:38:20Z,0.9996819496154785

I would like to write down what i feel and express my gratitudine, my respect and so on. But im not able to express all those emotions and sensations because they are so strong and powerful and no World could Express them right.
Thus, i say that i will never leave this Amazing Channel and the Amazing teacher that i found.
Thanks for this journey, thanks for all these free video, and thanks for yout teaching
I've loved all the day. Everyday has given my something, a new Lesson a new step to know my true self and understand the yoga and using It to understand  my self and find whats feel good. No One has ever told me to believe, to trust, to be brave, to surrender, to be free, to be open, to be kind.... These practices werent only movements but lots more. 
I know that change Need time. No rush, no judgment. I've learned it during this journey of True.
Tears of Joy. Thats It.

3427.0,"Adriene, I discovered your channel in June last year after years of trying to cope with a painful lower back. Although I was familiar with yoga, I never practiced it regularly, fearing that at an at home practice might lead me to further injure my back. After I did your first 30 days series, I discovered that I could touch my toes! (I've always had a stiff body). At the end of this series, I've discovered that, among other things, I can now do a side plank (a pose which I found difficult earlier). But most importantly, my back doesn't trouble me anymore. So, I would like to thank you for this, and for helping me develop a steady practice which I can access anytime, anywhere. You're my guru!
