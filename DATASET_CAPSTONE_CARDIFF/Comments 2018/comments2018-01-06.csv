98.0,"Hi Adriene I've started this journey during quarantine to help me get back into the swing of things with yoga; really enjoying this one so far! Something that keeps coming up for me (it's been bothering me for a while) but was bought to the forefront in this video was the imbalance in my legs whilst doing Warrior 1. My left leg is about an inch shorter than the right, so sometimes this can make certain poses difficult or one ankle feels more strained (felt this is especially in this practice), which to be honest can become very frustrating when you're trying to find a flow. 
So, with all that said, is there anyhting you could suggest that would help? Anything that I could work on? My goal at the moment is just to be able to get my heels to touch the ground in down-dog but fear I won't be able to achieve this because of my legs being different lengths.

224.0,"I've been doing your videos for the last 7 1/2 months and noticed last week I was just going through the motions because it had become my routine. I decided to do the 30 days of TRUE and have reconnected and found it helpful to have a new goal, to finish these 30 days. You have changed my life Adrien, truly. It all started with Yoga and now I have enough focus, energy, determination and will power that I have brought all kinds of positive changes to my life. I have goals, real solid goals with plans on how to reach them. I could go on forever. You have truly changed who I was/am for the absolute better. I'm connecting to something bigger than me and I'm grateful for it. I lived way too fast and careless, mindless, before. I just can't explain, but I have the feeling a lot of people here and you yourself completely understand what I mean. Thank you. I can not be grateful enough. It's been hard on my husband watching the old me fall away, because now he only has the choice to join me to be greater or to remain the same, either way I will love him for who he is and without conditions. I'm making positive changes in the lives of the people around me. I'm just such a better version of myself. Again I could go on forever.

I really enjoy all your videos. I‚Äôd say every video I try has never failed me. üòä I really enjoy doing your challenges on my own time (because you know, life happens haha).

Is anyone else having this same problem with the breathing exercise? Are there any videos that focus on this and help you to practise it?

584.0,It's totally a personal thing but breathing practice is hard for me. Two years ago I had bilateral pulmonary embolism (blood clots in both of my lungs) and breathing exercises usually cause anxiety attacks for me. I pushed through this one and thoroughly enjoyed the movement and flow but struggled with the breathing. My counselor will be proud though since I stuck it out even though it made me uncomfortable.,UgwftKrZWr8VLhQq5Cx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-12T12:08:21Z,0.9849430322647095

Remember: if you miss a day (or two, like me) don‚Äôt bully yourself about - and don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve failed. Yoga is a practice, a journey, and - as our beautiful leader has told us time and time again - there is no right or wrong. Your mat and your practice will be waiting when you come back - and you can always double up on videos like I did today.

I'll fall into much the same old pattern and don't feel the creativity as strongly.

I am so very very grateful for your videos and your good attitude toward yoga.

833.0,"AFTER a late start to yesterday's practice, today, I made it to the mat at a reasonable time (in the early afternoon).

I was ready for the challenge for today, but when I got to the mat, my body was saying ""not today"" and so throughout, I was listening to my inner self and I was being guided by what suited me.  There was no planking, but I have promised myself that if there is any planking tomorrow, I will be there.  I got through the session, needing more time on the mat, just to relax and take the day in, so tuning into mediation music after this session was a real benefit for me.

I noticed through out the session,my neck and the shoulders were still aching.  It really made me aware of what muscle groups I am using the most and what one's I don't spend quality time on.  I love the fact that this journey is giving me an eye opener into what I need to work on and I have also noticed, that my breathing has changed for the better.  I am still not tuned in to my breathe and movement but I am listening and practicing and I have noticed it is making my life off the mat better.  I noticed that through this yoga journey it has helped me to breathe so much better through out the day.

When it comes to my wellbeing, I have been suffering from fatigue but these half an hour sessions have been so beneficial.  I always feel as though I am in a better place afterwards.  At times, it is just the challenge of getting to the mat because I try and get everything done beforehand but once I am there, I am focused on what is in front of me, instead of having my mind wander like it has been doing when I first found this path.  I am learning, and I am growing and I am accepting what my body and mind can do when it is in a good place to begin with.  I feel as though spending these minutes on the mat, has made me more focused on my inner self and by putting things into practice in the real world is helping me immensely to a more healthy lifestyle.",UgztCFj9L3Cf3WEeUb54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-07T04:13:22Z,0.9945281147956848

And I remembered yesterday I was so proud for compelting the 4th day, since I can say that this was probably the first time in my life that I was exercising for 4 days in a row. And as I remembered this intention and how I don't want to loose the track of this journey and stay behind, I just grabbed my mat and started doing it. And I loved it. I loved it that I put taking time for me first, even though I had an exhausting day and at first thought all I want to do is lay on my bed and watch some series.

1013.0,"Wow. When pushing down my hands, I imagined pushing down an invisible wall. After I lost my dad at the age of 9 I really struggled in all areas of my life, because I basically shut myself off completely (thinking that I had to be strong and not put weight on anybody¬¥s shoulders but mine), which led to social anxiety and severe depression.
I¬¥m 24 now and have finally began to truly heal and transform since discovering this channel and yoga 2 1/2 years ago My life has made a 180¬∞ turn ever since.
Today, to really imagine pushing down this wall that seperated me from everyone else and kept myself from getting out there and reaching other people felt so, so truly magical.

2) when you do the stretch to the sky to breathe with thumbs up, do I lift my shoulders, or keep them down, reaching up from my shoulders, not reaching with my shoulders up, too?
3)same question in warrior pose when I reach up, wrt my shoulders.
4) what mat are you using?  mine is 24"" wide and I seem to need something wider...

1377.0,"Thinking a lot about what you said in Day 4's practice about recognizing how ""gripping"" on the mat usually correlates with something we're holding on to off the mat as well. I find myself holding my breath far more often than I should in practice, so I love these sessions that focus on pranayama and breathing  appropriately. You have a gift!
