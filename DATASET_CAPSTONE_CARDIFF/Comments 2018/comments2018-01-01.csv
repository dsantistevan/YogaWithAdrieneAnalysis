Ive recently found my way into the yogi journey. You have been my favorite Instructor. I hope in time perhaps I may also begin teaching others. 
I am currently on day 7 of the TRUE journey. So excited, and grateful. 
Favorite aspect of the channel is your attentiveness to create content and routines for particular problem areas. 
Myself for instance; 2 years ago crashed on my bicycle (to avoid being hit), my left knee dug into the pavement, has never been the same. Plus my current employment as a forklift operator has me seated a fair amount through the day. As you could imagine all those combinations make my knee hurt and back kill, plus what feels like oodles of tension in my legs when I am standing or stationary. 
If you ever made a excercise for people who have sitting jobs, I feel it could get a great response. 
Much love.

169.0,"I wasn't aware of this 30 Day yoga Journey in January...but I did do a 30 day challenge at the beginning of the year that changed my life...I lost weight, started my mornings out by setting my intention...and when the 30 days was over I limped along searching for something else that would help me in my morning routing...a coach that I could read an email from every day, someone that would encourage me and let me do things at my speed (I'm 58 years old, battled cancer less than a year ago and now I'm fighting my way back).  And look what happened...I came across True!  I started the first day and got interrupted half way through...but I came back to it later that day, started from the beginning and finished the whole thing. While the ending music was finishing, I was in tears, sobbing...I found my coach, my tribe, my life.  I love the Zen parts, I love Benji keeping you humble and not caring you are a big shot yoga star, and I love being given the permission to find what feels good to me.  After these 30 days (I finished day 3 today) I will join RISE and be a total 'Yoga with Adriene' groupy.  I have to take a 2 week break when I have a lumpectomy on my left breast May 2. Thankfully I'm able to ride a bicycle during those 2 weeks, but I will definitely miss my yoga with Adriene routine the most.  But I know it will be waiting for me to start back up.  How can something free be so priceless?  You are a blessing to me Adriene.

246.0,"You are amazing Adriene and yoga is amazing. I have been doing Yoga with your videos for a year now and i really feel different. I used to have back and neck pain all the time, at some times it was so bad I couldn't wait to go to physiotherapy again when I had just left there. I also had no core/arm/leg strength at all, my stamina was the worst and I felt fat. I was basically really feeling really bad about my body. But then i commited, and started on your videos, then 30 day yoga camp. And other videos almost every day, for my back, my core, for when my emotional state was off, or when I just felt like being productive. Sometimes even twice a day!
Over the summer I started 30 days of Yoga (also partly in my holiday in France, that was amazing) and my back pain was sort of gone then.

I sort of stopped my commitment after that sadly, but picked it up quickly when my back became worse again and started Yoga Revolution. I was so proud when I managed to keep a full crow up for about 10 seconds orso! I just finished that over the new year and am now committed to TRUE (only two days behind on it). My neck and back still hurt, but significantly less. On top of that, I managed to do a (sort of) hand/shoulderstand on someone else in my Jiu-jitsu lesson today. Something which I've always failed miserably, because I didn't have the core strength. 
I still feel bad from time to time, but I have accepted that that is okay and I just have to stay myself and stay TRUE.

Anyway Sorry for the long post. I just want to say THANK YOU Adriene, THANK YOU! Thank you for all the advice and love, laughs and angry, crying and Benji, for having my back and most off all for all your effort in these videos.

264.0,"Adriene,¬†
You don't know how many lives you touch. I am a very driven person who has come under an overwhelming amount of stress and anxiety that has now taken its toll on my body. I was alway on the go, always wanting to be perfect- the perfect mom, the perfect employee, the perfect spouse... this drained me until one day when i was at work and had a full blown panic attack. I thought I was always a little anxious in the past and thought I understood what an anxiety attack felt like but nope...there I was short of breath feeling like i was going to pass out and was positive something was horribly wrong with me.. Well, now 4 months later I can tell you that I have put myself through too much, for too long. I was like a car running on empty and now every day have to work twice as hard to get back to feeling like myself. I was terrified to do anything including workout but one day I was home and told myself snap out of it. I went on youtube and typed ""yoga for anxiety"" and came across our videos. You helped pull me out of my shell. Some days are harder than others, but I know I want my life back. I must admit you have helped me more than you could imagine. Im so glad I found you. ¬†You are a wonderful person and great soul. Im starting late on TRUTH, but cannot wait to go on this journey with you and the others.

My life has been filled with so many changes throughout the past couple of years: 4 different jobs, 3 moves, graduate school, and a painful breakup. Yoga has been my constant through the days of joy and the days where I wasn't sure if I could make it through. While I love practicing at various studios with others, your classes have been what I return to time and time again -- whether I'm new in town and don't know where to go yet, or just want to spend some time on my mat at home when it's -5 outside!

I am now over that cheap and have been vegan for 10 months, which is making me feel real good, however I am doing nothing to take care of my physical strength and mind.  I need to tap into a bit of Adrienne  again. You are one of the most beautiful souls I've ever had the pleasure of watching.

In Hindu culture, the essence of all our emotions are the 9 Rasa. I have experienced each Rasa while doing Yoga With Adriene! Thank you Adriene for everything! The 9 Rasas are:

1. Love/Sringara‚Ä¶ It is the ultimate Rasa. The king or queen emotion that heals anything. It frees the ego and connects us to devotion. When you appreciate beauty it connects you to the source of love. It is the creative play between Shiva and Shakti, sun and moon, yin and yang. The purpose of the universe it to experience this divine love. This love exists in everything. It is within each one of us and radiates out to the cosmos.

2. Joy/Hasya‚Ä¶ This Rasa connects you to your humor, laughter, happiness and contentment. It is the extension of what you feel within love.

3. Wonder/Adhuta‚Ä¶ Curiosity, Mystery, Awe. When you become fascinated with the idea of life. It is your playfulness and innocence. You enter into complete appreciation and become an explorer or adventurer. It is magic!

4. Courage/Vira‚Ä¶ Bravery, Confidence, Pride. When you call upon your the Warrior that lives inside you. It is strong and vibrant.

5. Peace/Shanta‚Ä¶ Deep calmness and relaxation. When you become still and quiet. In peace you become so full that you are empty. You will not find peace anywhere but within.

6. Sadness/Karuna‚Ä¶ When you can experience sadness and connect it back to the cosmos, you then experience compassion. Compassion is what connects us all. Through compassion we can relate deeply to each other. When ones sadness is truly experienced around a situation it can give a sense of completion. Grieving is a key aspect in healing.

7. Anger/Raudra‚Ä¶ In anger we go into the fire. One moment of anger can destroy lifetimes of good merit. Respect anger. When anger isn‚Äôt honored it can bring up irritation, violence, hatred. Feel the anger. Let it move through you. Breath into the fire.

8. Fear/Bhayanaka‚Ä¶ Doubt, Worry, Insecurity. When we live our lives in fear, we shut down completely.

9. Disgust/Vibhasta‚Ä¶ self pity, Loathing, self hatred. Only through a loving emotion can you heal and appease disgust.",UgzH9_43u2yq_Kst7rR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-02T03:30:37Z,0.6687852372824875

926.0,"Hello Adriene and Yogis in this 30 Day Challenge,
   I am currently living in Mongolia with my family as an international school teacher. One day I searched for a 20 minute sequence video to challenge to get myself back on the mat as well as encourage my friends to yoga again. I called it the 20 minute yoga sequence challenge. I would practice the sequence myself then posted the video on facebook to challenge a friend to practice it as well. And then anyone was welcome to do the same. This is when I found Adriene's yoga video and started following her channel on you tube. I am looking forward to getting to know my true self more.
Love and Light to all!! <3

I tried to take a yoga class in person last year but I was physically shaking throughout much of it, and then crying because it stirred up so much stuff inside me.  I think this will be a better fit for me until I feel comfortable with my ability to get through a session without feeling scared and embarrassed and hopefully go to group classes again.

Yoga, and yourself, have been helping immensely. The goals for the future are to hopefully be more positive and try to love myself, despite the large waves of shortcomings I see in myself. It's a struggle, but I won't quit or give up. Looking forward to this <3 The 30 and 31 day challenges really forces me to follow through (I can't stand skipping schedules, that's one good thing!)

Other than that, thank you so much for these videos <3",UgyS35d0_zovwd_W8yZ4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2018-01-01T21:13:05Z,0.9959806203842163

When I really stop and think about what I truly need to give my body, yoga is often the thing I need but I tend to ignore it in favour of practices that perhaps give me the ‚Äúresults‚Äù I want faster which is just a reminder that I still buy into that standard of what is deemed beautiful in our society and that my own thoughts about how I look need some adjusting. Maybe this practise will help with that. That can be my intention I suppose. To be more aware of what I tell myself about my own body, how it looks, and what is attractive.

Writing to you from Seattle, Wa.

My personal yoga journey actually began at the same time as Adriene's first 30 day yoga challenge, and has ebbed and flowed under her guidance and my own personal exploration ever since.

Since then, I've learned a lot about presence, living with intention, and the power of what we can uncover on the mat to enrich life off the mat.

This year, I'm looking forward to practicing contentedness. As a goal oriented person, I often miss out on the beauty of the present moment, because my mind is ahead of me on what I can accomplish or achieve next. This often leaves me feeling dissatisfied, when I actually have so very much to be grateful for. So much achievement to already celebrate. 

I'm also committing to looking for opportunities to be grateful. And to generally be more fluid.",UgyZBE0OR26lt9go5PR4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2018-01-01T20:51:36Z,0.9977014660835266

1523.0,"Hi from Amsterdam. Looking forward to starting tomorrow! Your 30-day challenge two years ago helped me to start doing yoga daily. I'm recovering from a heavy concussion this past month and haven't been able to do much activity. This 30-day challenge is the perfect way to start doing yoga daily again and help my mind and body to recover fully. A home practice is the perfect way to start slow so that when it becomes to much I can pause, but your videos are also always the perfect length, so I hope I feel good enough to just do it!¬†

Thank you so much for giving me this daily routine yoga activity that I learned to appreciate as something I do just for me. Feeling overwhelmed fast, yoga has helped me to relax, enjoy and starting to appreciate my body with a little humor. The way you do your videos, stay realistic, point out the embarrassing stuff and help everyone to just be and enjoy, instead of conforming to this unrealistic image of the western model. You made me see that in yoga, so thank you!!",Ugx9IAWynLoWkA9T4mN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-01T19:54:23Z,0.9976614713668823

I first started doing yoga with you (the virtual you :)) a few months ago as a way to show some self-love and nurturing to myself after some challenging experiences. I get so much satisfaction from sharing my love with others that I realized for so long I had forgotten to show myself that same compassion! I am continuing on my journey of self-love this year and SO looking forward to feeling and contributing to this worldwide bundle of positive energy, compassion, and acceptance that you will be leading for the next 30 days!

You work so hard to fix yourself, but maybe what you need isn't another tactic, another book, another expert, another five step plan. Maybe you don't need to be fixed. Maybe what is really holding you back is the idea that you need to be fixed. Maybe you just need to let yourself play instead of always making yourself do homework.

I grabbed my mat, found Yoga Revolution and committed myself to not fixing myself but loving myself and making more time to play.

Yesterday I realized that I had not put intentions in my 2017 remembering the previous new year. 2016 had been such a difficult year for me that 2017 I just wanted to be calm and there was no more. This year no longer, since I have already gathered much of the experiences and teachings I needed and this new year I already have intentions: I want to trust more in me, knowing that I am capable of what I propose, but not leaving it in the intention , but to work for that by making me the necessary habits to achieve it. No doubt I want to get closer to me and love me, since I have been my worst enemy for many years. I deserve the truce, love and peace with myself.

3195.0,I really need this to start off my weight loss journey right. I started my first 30 day yoga challenge last year (still can't believe how fast 2017 went by lol) but didn't finish because of school and coming home tired. But I did make it somewhere near the end. Anyway I'm excited and ready to do this and I'm gonna try to make it all the way through this 30 days of yoga with you and everyone else üôÇüôÇ,Ugz4HURSQn3dQIcKtxt4AaABAg,2.0,3.0,2018-01-01T08:09:28Z,0.9900323152542114
