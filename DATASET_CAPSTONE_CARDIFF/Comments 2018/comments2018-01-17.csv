2.0,I did this 30-journey again from scratch cause I wanna be true to myself again. Cause I am in a mental state ware my old trauma has been opened again. And It feels likeI am losing myself again like 30 years ago. So when the question came of naming one thing you like about yourself all I could do was cry cause there was nothing that I could find about myself. It‚Äôs kinda sad of being for many people always the positive and inspirational one that they say about me. But I could not find any thing to say about myself. So we are in this journey again and staying true to myself how painful it can be.,UgzGLRnbnByPwC1s0Vh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-22T07:19:10Z,-0.9928448796272278

14.0,"This is the first time I've commented on any of your videos, although I've been a participant in the YWA community for two years now. This past June, I got a concussion that forced me to take a leave of absence from graduate school. In addition to feeling pretty cruddy as I recovered, I also became severely anxious and depressed (I started doing yoga to treat my anxiety), especially because I feel my future with my education/career has become more uncertain with this injury.

When I felt more physically able, I started doing yoga again with this 30-day challenge. It has been disheartening to start again with almost no physical strength. I haven't been able to do this journey every day in a row, but here I am, three months after suffering in bed for days when I tried to watch a screen, proud to have done yoga for 16 days.

The thing that I love about myself today is my courage. I was intimidated by the length of this video and was worried I would not be able to complete it. I wasn't able to get into every position (half-moon, anyone?) but I did finish, and I didn't beat myself up for not doing it ""perfectly"". Just like how I don't have to hit every complicated pose to have a good practice, I have begun to internalize that I have worth beyond just completing my degree and holding a high-profile career. It has taken courage to change my whole mindset about what having a good life means. Even if my injury does keep me from finishing grad school, I will be able to accept what comes.

 but I felt like something has been missing.

Whenever I get into a circle of negativity I can't seem to figure out what's going on.

In times of stress I need more yoga, especially the calm and grounding practices with meditation and relaxation.

It's as simple as that but sometimes I'm too caught up to realise.
However, sooner or later I do in fact realis it might just take me a little longer.

A lot of times we do know what we need and what we have to do to find what feels good but it happens that we force things and want to have everything as soon as possible.

Eventually, when we really take time to slow down it really changes the game.

I just wanted to take you for this incredible journey. It's my 76th day of yoga with you and my body and mind never felt this way. I'm healing. I'm one of those people who cried when you asked ''what do you love about yourself ?'', because to me, love is unconditional and for the moment, there aren't a lot of things that I love unconditionally about myself. But I was able to think about one thing : I love myself for doing yoga. And then another thing : I love myself for being strong and never forgetting that I am. 
I'm growing so much thanks to you.

214.0,"Thank you for this practice. I've gained a bit of weight over the past few months, a lot of it due to severe anxiety, depression, and stress that's kept me from being able to work for the past three months. Today, I needed to go shopping for a few clothing items to replace ones I've worn through, and I couldn't even work up the courage to try anything on because I couldn't stand the thought of looking at myself in the mirror. My boyfriend was outside waiting for me, and when we got back to the car, he asked me to make a commitment right there to start loving myself as much as I possibly could. At 7 pm, finally I worked up the resolve to come to YWA for day 16. When I saw it was about self love, I was excited and scared. I was one of the people who started to cry when I couldn't think of a reason to love myself. I sat down in frustration when I fell out of a standing split. Then I picked myself back up and thought of how you always tell us to accept where we're at today. Some days can be so mentally draining but I think the journey is worth it, and thank you so much for being such a massive part of my life every day.

216.0,"I think that every video is too advanced or something, and I sometimes skip it that day, but I keep up on the poses, every one. Every time. My balance is good, my flexibility not so much, but I recognize improvement (been doing stretches after workouts, and know how my muscle likes it). 
It seems like my breathing is the biggest problem. Or, ""problem"". I know I'm quite scared to do the breathing because my body keeps my childhood fears and tears. I can't even breathe deeper through my lungs, the stomach is just something to forget about. But I'm not stressing over this - I feel proud that I manage to follow, that I have control over my muscles, flexibility and my ability to do it. 
Today I learned that maybe these longer ones are more beneficial to get the right mindset (for me), but that's just gonna be more mental fighting to get done, I know this, but I keep moving forward. Fifth video this week, I'm proud even though I'm not doing as good as I wished for, and that my mental health keeps it more of a doorstep that I want.

I've been there caring for everone, but me and it was not a happy loving place. You have to regularly practice self love so when you really need it you can take care of yourself and in turn be ok out in this crazy world.

Being out of the journey for 2 weeks and hoping back in  yesterday was one feel, today's session was fine tuning those tweaks that have needed love on. Finding the breath was a a challenge today, but when we found that one thing were  proud about (Consistency) to love about our self, was when the gears shifted within to tap into that breath.

Thank you so much for this cycle of practices ! I follow it from France and yes it seams to be that the time difference is now of 5 month ><.

I love your sequences and your humour, the awareness it brings, the fun it brings to the practice, the joy, the simplicity of this practice : looking for what feels good no matter what the asana is supposed to look like, today it feels like this for me or on one side different than the other and it's perfectly ok, morevoer : it's amazing ! It's a real journey to my true self ! I don't put words on it but it's a fealing, a fealing deep inside, oh yeah !

I'm a musician by night and a freelance stylist by day, hauling heavy bags of merchandise, bending over sets, crawling over or under photographic equipment, often moving walls and heavy surfaces‚Äîrarely off my feet. 

While I'm grateful for not sitting at a desk all day, my work has taken a toll on my body as I've aged and for the last four or five years, I've taken ibuprofen almost daily. A friend recommended your 30 Day Yoga practice and I then moved straight into True 30 Day. It has made me aware of my breath, of my posture (standing and sitting), aware that I need to stretch off and on during the day. 

I had a very physical work day on Thursday and really noticed how different I felt: stronger, sturdier, more flexible, less tired at days end. I am convinced, after 46 straight days of yoga, that I not only need but actually WANT to do this every day‚Äîfor the remainder of my days. It has pretty much been a life changer for me and I can't remember the last time I popped an ibuprofen.

I loved to feel myself sweating, feel my muscles lengthening and feel my heart filling with every affirmation of self-love. Today, I thought to myself that I love my work ethic and my resilience.

I was willing to accept you into my life and home during the last half of this practice.  In fact, I called you cute even though you surprised me when I did a twist.  You are a very large spider.   I'm sorry to set my cat on you, but you started to get the wrong idea and approach me when I was ready to finish this practice.  I figured I would let nature do it's work.  Now I can't find you.  Please do not show yourself to me again. 

Dear Adriene,

I think I have a new appreciation for reverse warrior and extended side angle.  Something I've been looking for in my practice for years because I dislike both postures. I've been dealing with a lot of hip and side body stuff so this and the previous practices have really helped.  Thanks for a great re-introduction to the practice.

386.0,"Adriene, you have changed my life.

When I started doing yoga a year and a half ago, I was a depressed, slightly overweight person looking for a different way of life.  A way of life in which I loved myself. Back then I wanted to be someone completely different, but now I have fallen in love. With yoga, me and life. I started yoga to get fit, and while I have gotten fit, I have also become a more free and happy person. I have begun to conquer my fears, living a dream that I never thought I could live and have learnt to be at peace with myself. The last time I did a self love practice, I couldn't find a single thing I loved. I hated my size and my body. But now i've realised, I'm not a size. I'm not a number. I am this awesome, loving, funny person who is super lovely to be around. Today, the list of things I loved about myself included everything- the faults, the mistakes and the good parts. It's definitely been a journey falling in love with myself, and I'm glad it didn't take me longer than my sixteen years. so  I can live the rest of my life happy in my own skin and having my own back.  Sorry for the long comment, but I do aspire to become a writer someday. üòâ Thank you for this journey and everything, and I'm sending you all the love my heart can hold.
To anybody else going through a similar journey too, I'm sending you lots of love and light.‚ù§‚ù§",Ugwnoh2r5Ro0EJr5pPt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-05-22T16:55:53Z,0.9994292855262756

444.0,"to be honest I really struggled just clicking on day 16.. I looked at the 41min duration and just noped. for the next two weeks I either did the 5-10min practices, nothing at all.. I don't understand why I didn't want to do it, because 40min is not that long. Before this I've been consistently doing yoga everyday for the past five months. But this was strangely too much for me. When I confronted the mat and did it, I even checked how much longer to go (at the 24min mark) and I have never done that before! I've always enjoyed yoga but this was weird. However reading everyone's comments are really uplifting. You guys remind me why yoga is so great.",Ugx5lJZ48c2ld8u8d1Z4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2018-03-22T06:51:18Z,0.8990747332572937

537.0,"When you said ""think of one thing you love about yourself"" .. I instantly felt lost.. I didn't know what to think, I opened my eyes in shock and my eyes started watering. Then you said ""this can be emotional"" I looked at the screen and smiled, but cried at the same time. You reminded me that I'm not alone. Self love is so new to me. It's very uncomfortable and emotional. I'm struggling as a parent, as a person, while trying to find things to love about myself. My answer was my ability to make it through each day. I've seen your account for a few years, but never clicked on your videos. Until last month (January) I've made it to day 16 (in reality took me about 20-25 days so far) but you're unleashing my suppressed emotions. And I think that's important in order to grow.

565.0,"About ten minutes into day 16 I literally, without thinking, uttered under my breath: ""I @&#ing love this""¬†I'm a bigger guy, currently on a weight loss journey. I started in September at 316 lbs and did my usual attempt at free weights and cardio. Usually what happens when I attempt this, is I go really hard with these methods of exercise and I end up getting burned out, give up, and then get depressed.¬†However, this time when I started to burn out I happen to stumble across Adriene and in turn started to develop my yoga practice. The first time was in November where I did the other 30 day challenge. After completion I got back at the treadmill, where I broke my all time best total distance AND fastest mile- multiple times. Now here in January my knees started to hurt, so I jumped back to Adriene and started the True practice.¬†The reason I'm commenting today is to say thank you. If I hadn't found your videos I surely would have given up on my weight loss journey once again. Instead I'm down to 277 lbs and counting. My mind and body feels the best it has in my entire adult life. I can tell from your videos that you're super modest and will try to give credit to the practice itself, but I hope you know just how much what you do means to all your viewers! A quote you said in day 16, ""you hold up a mirror and you get this opportunity to see yourself... And then you have a choice.. And I'm suggesting we choose love""

As a 16 year old with low self confidence,I compare myself to others.

One of my intentions is more self love and positivity and these videos are the epitome of that. They are bringing me one step closer to loving myself the way I love others.‚ù§Ô∏èThank you Adriene and to all on this journey, you are amazing!

i'm not going to lie - i'm a little frustrated with myself. but i'm grateful that i was able to take the time today to turn my attention inwards, because i didn't realize just how much gunk i had in me until i did. that self-reflection is worth so much more than getting a pose right. <3",UgyuTdPbIUysYXbRc4p4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2018-01-25T03:47:48Z,0.9925703406333923

Growing up, I was taught if you felt too confident about yourself, you were cocky or arrogant. My mom liked to ""keep us humble"" by bringing up faults that we had if she ever felt that we felt too good about ourselves. So I have never felt comfortable with finding something I loved about myself, for fear that I would be vain. But you, my dear, have changed that all for me. I absolutely can love myself, really truly love who I am, without being arrogant. It's okay to love who you are. I'm tired of walking through life with my shoulders hunched over, beating myself up over every little thing because I think that's how I should live. I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Adriene, for helping me get past this. It's going to take time, but I already feel an awakening that I've never felt before.

I was diagnosed with a pretty severe auto immune disease that attacks my joints and can cause permanent damage. I was put on chemotherapy and nsaids first. Then I was put on biweekly shots that I have to give myself at home. Last year in January I got very very  sick with reactions to my medicine was in and out of the hospital for 4 months. I was losing weight so quickly from the  daily pain in my stomach from the chemo/nsaids that my gallbladder died and I had to have surgery. During those months I was so weak I  could barely leave the house or bed. I was getting dehydrated from malnutrition and suffering from daily leg cramps.
I found your channel last year and fell in love with Yoga! I did the revolution 30 days! I have found yoga to be very healing for myself. It helps with  the chronic pain I have and my muscles have gotten stronger every single day! I couldn‚Äôt even do a  full plank a year ago. Now I can do a full plank and even side plank!!!

Your videos have absolutely changed my life. I got really excited when you started this 30 day yoga journey because I really wanted to be apart of it. Lately, it's been a little bit of a struggle due to being in classes and work. Though, I'm taking a Movement for the Actor course 3 times a week and we get to work on similar poses and movements like in your videos. Because I've been working on your videos before hand, I felt a lot more comfortable in this class which makes me feel really good inside! Today was a very busy day so I didn't get to do this video, but I am watching it and think I'm going to do this for my next morning.
