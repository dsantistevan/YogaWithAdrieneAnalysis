0.0,"Believe in yourself, your uniqueness, your worthiness.

I believe we each have this special unique quality. 

The tools of yoga and the process we allow on the mat help us uncover, reveal and align with what feels like our true purpose. 

Authenticity.

It is my hope that through this practice we become closer to ourselves and therefore closer to finding out what our meaningful contribution to humanity is. 

All that on the mat?

Yes. 

The second half of this journey is dynamic and really fun. Keep showing up, keep doing your best, trust your authenticity and Find What Feels Good.",UgyEIeu7GBcK32UldxJ4AaABAg,20.0,344.0,2018-01-16T13:14:52Z,0.9998430013656616

I've realized over the past 75 days that I'm coming back each day because it is a gift that I get to return to myself, my center, my mat - a place that I felt so far from for so long.

Love your body of works online! Been following for 4 years now! <3 

Anyways, I had a question on feet... When you say flex the feet during poses, sometimes my outer foot cramps. What is happening with that and should I being doing something different? 

Also, during some poses my body falls asleep (like going up the outer calve to thigh into the hip. Is this normal or ok?

299.0,"I apologize in advance for the long comment but today's practice was... amazing. I have recently left behind my family, friends, and husband to pursue my degree. Something that I have been wanting to do for years but never had the courage. Today a couple things happened during practice. 1. When you said ""if your mind starts to tell you you can't, be kind to yourself."" In my mind I thought ""Holy shit look at me go!"" A huge improvement from where I have been in the past. 2) when we went to go ""fly"" I did it. I FREAKING DID IT! No wobbles, nothing! Once I started to realize it of course I fell over but I started to cry... i believed I could so I did. Moving. Starting over in a new place where I don't know anyone. It's because I believe I can. It's hard and sometimes it's not so fun but believing in myself, not needing someone to tell me I'm doing well, these things come from me... and you.

401.0,"I have never been good with ANYTHING that involves balance, but I made it through all of those poses without falling over once! I can also *almost* touch my heels to the ground in downward dog. I have always carried a lot of tension in my shoulders and jaw but have been very aware of it since I started this journey - my shoulders have never been more relaxed. It's exciting to see all of these improvements! I can feel myself getting stronger and more flexible. I am noticing things I never would have paid attention to before and am correcting the issues. I'm also sleeping better than I have before, and the only change in my routine is that I am sticking with the yoga. 

I have tried your other 30 day series (as well as LOTS of other 30 exercise series) and have never completed them. I miss a day and then give up, because I felt I had already failed. I decided this year that I was going to stop getting so down on myself - if I miss a day, it's okay! I can just try again the next day. I am a day behind, but this is definitely the furthest I have ever made it in a 30 day series of any sort.

439.0,"AFTER yesterday's LISTEN journey, I was thinking we were really going to be pushed for today, with a lot of planking and a lot of downward dog (I must say, I never look at my dogs the same as I can see the Yogi within them) but it wasn't so - and I didn't mind.

Once again I came to the mat, totally prepared for something new and something challenging but rewarding at the end and as usual, I was not disappointed.

I really love ""coming to the mountain"" and so today I was in a really good place from beginning to end although most of my thinking was about, which foot is left and which one is right.  I always lose sight of what foot I am suppose to be on (but I don't care) and as always it was a really nice way to connect with myself after a day of talking to a mediator who is helping me through some personal issues  It was nice to push the session to the back of my mind and step onto the mat and do something that I believe is benefiting me from day to day.  

If I wasn't taking the time to do this, I am sure that I would be looking further into trying to understand what is causing me to feel the way I do and not looking at ways of helping myself through my depression journey.  By letting go of what I am feeling and concentrating on what I am doing on the mat is really helping me through the days.  Once I have finished on the mat, I am in a better frame of mind and I am looking to do something that makes me feel as good.

I have noticed too, that I spend a lot of time yawning while doing yoga.  Is this natural?  I am saying yes, because I feel as though I am winding down after a long day, even if I am doing the yoga in the morning or afternoon or early evening.  Today, I felt tired afterwards, that I took the time to have a rest and I did go to sleep.  Yesterday, I was yawning but I wasn't at the stage of needing sleep.  I am finding this all so relaxing that I have found a good path for when the day gets hard and I just need a little time to myself.  What am I going to do when the 30 days is up is beyond me, but in the mean time, I will continue through to day 30 and I look forward to the times we go to the mountain, we stand in warrior pose and we breathe together.",UgyIvy7YuvI9E1Bf56h4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-17T10:42:58Z,0.19477804339384042

I‚Äôve been following you for at least 3-4 years and participated in all of your previous 30 days of yoga‚Äôs and loved them all of course. But I have to say that this year‚Ä¶ Well, it‚Äôs beyond words. Each practice is so complete and meaningful. And apart from the stretching and breathing I have never felt such a difference in my core strength as I already do after 14 days. I literally feel that I can cycle faster, I can stand taller by my desk at work and move more gracefully at ballet class and actually lift my legs a little bit higher - simply giving an extra thought to my core area. So I wanted to thank you for this. THANK YOU for being so amazing and for knowing what we all need and for explaining how to move and to improve our search for finding what feels good and what serves us well.

787.0,"Hi Adriene! I've been using your videos for near-daily home practice for a couple of years now, but I really wanted to thank you especially for the True series. The Center practice was really pivotal for me and I've already noticed how I hold myself differently. I'm a fairly fit women in my early twenties so I can power through some harder practices, but some easier things still felt a bit weird. Halfway lift never did anything for me until you prompted us to move from our center. Suddenly it became a move where I could expand and feel confident and now I always smile when I lift up. For stronger poses I would enjoy the wobble and burn but now I feel a new strength and ease when holding high lunges and such, and I can feel new muscles in my legs stretching. It's wonderful! Not mention I hold my shoulders further back and my head higher when off the mat. Thank you so much for your dedication to sharing such beautiful practices. Thank you for helping us all find strength we didn't know we had. Namaste x",UgzaMs1K0y3lrfOYpn54AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2018-01-16T11:07:16Z,0.9996635913848877

850.0,"I'm so proud that I've been with you this whole journey so far as someone who does not do regular anything! I have a couple of questions for anyone who sees this and might be able to help: what does it mean in some poses ""to claw through the fingertips""? I understand it's meant to take pressure off the wrists (which is really important for me as my wrists get sore easily) but I don't quite know how to do it. Any tips are welcome! Second question: is it normal that I'm not yet feeling the release in my back/neck/shoulders area that some people are feeling? In the first couple of days, my back felt even more sore/tight than usual. Could it be that I'm doing some poses wrong, or is my body only still getting used to yoga which I haven't really done before TRUE?
