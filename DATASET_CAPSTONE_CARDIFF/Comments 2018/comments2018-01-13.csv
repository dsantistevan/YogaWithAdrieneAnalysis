33.0,"This video reinforced something very valuable to me. I tried it yesterday and ended up in a puddle of tears on the floor because I just couldn’t seem to connect to my centre. But Adriene you taught me that yoga is learning and it’s curiosity and just seeing what happens. So today I tried again and just once, in one of the halfway lifts, it clicked and there was the connection to my core. I lost it again after that, but I finished the video with no tears and I’m so proud I came back to try again, to see if I could learn something new today.

37.0,"This is my second 30 day yoga practice in a row (finished dedicate, loved it) and this was the most challenging practice yet. First, I forced myself to do it, even though (perhaps laziness, perhaps not) I didnt want to, so I had a begrudging outlook from the start -- and Adriene called them out at the very beginning -- checking a box, which is exactly what I wanted to be able to do by the end of this practice, fear of not progressing on my timeline, which isn't the best motivation for doing yoga, and even more so in my case, as a spiritual practice. I was chugging along, breathing and centering myself, until that was all I could do, barely able to keep myself positively in the moment. And then my thoughts hijacked the practice, the seeds i planted before the practice started began to grow and count down the minutes on the matt that i typically cherish and want more of.. I had all kinds of nasty thoughts (""uggh, I wish she had chosen something differen, I wish that was the last pose, i wish she would slow downt"" -- this practice, for me, was deceptively hard)  in my head by the final downward dog of the final flow, but once we landed at the end in cross legged seat, after we brought our hands to our heart -- I felt aware of my previous harsh thoughts, yet not consumed by them, almost seperate. It was a good feeling, to be able to accept and not judge i felt a certain unsavory way in the moment, yet by the end, grateful id pushed through and experienced it at all. Im excited to come back tomorrow -- this time with a better attitude!! I plant the seeds for a great practice tomorrow in this moment today. Namaste to you, Adriene, and to all other yogis as we all learn to walk this beautiful, challenging, and enriching path. We say that getting on the mat is the hardest part -- and it truly is. Its easy to take our time and energy for granted. We go through the motions, we become complacent, and we miss opportunities of gratitude and often belatedly recognize the gratitude we couldve had in the moment. While I always feel its better to reflect and appreciate after the fact, I can't help but wonder, how would the experience change for me if I paired it with gratitude in the moment? A spiritual experiment awaits!",UgxHvaOVWO39nyMBFkp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-12-13T06:01:35Z,-0.05320075624305288

Those hipdips I had to let a lioness roar out to push through into that DWFD was well needed and felt the heat travel through my arms and back with bent legs to feel my tummy and spine hum together. Was nice to do it with Ludovico Einaudi's 'Nuvole Bianche' the slow and quiet momentsof the song fit the slow and quiet moments of the practice.

144.0,The snap was definitely necessary! Those side dips too! I was feeling the rush of all the hard work when it was time for child's pose and really felt the importance of this type of practice on and off the mat. Love it :) thank you so much for leaving your playlists up. This had been another great practice. I can see how I am becoming centred and in that I am finding what feels good. Being able to choose a playlist each month keeps me motivated and present in what the purpose of returning to the mat is. But the best part is that I found this and chose it. It was what I needed in my life right now. Nameste.,UgzBWjqCSMLAFXeC80J4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-04-01T16:13:11Z,0.999581515789032

I have a problem with my right wrist which has lost flexibility due to a bit of necrosis in the hand so I pretty much do every move on fists instead of flat hands. Every time I do the side dip it hurts my lower back on the opposite side, especially on one side. I did the first round but not the others. I am not sure where my weakness is showing up in this move.

I’m also coming from a high energy week last week, and so my body deserves this break. Also, this is the first time I’ve felt comfortable in child’s pose for a bit.

211.0,"This is is the first time during this series that showing up at my mat felt like a monumental chore. I'm super tired and have a headache and really would much rather have sprawled on my bed with Netflix and gone to sleep. But I promised myself that barring health issues getting in my way I would do this no matter what. So I showed up. I still want to go to sleep and I still have a headache, but I did it and I gave it my best effort today and only fell over once, so I'm proud of myself for that. Yoga is an amazing journey in persistence and resilience as well as growth and you are the best guide on youtube. Having just read the caption below this video, you're also a guide who uncannily seems to always know just what I'm feeling or needing.

at the end of this video my mind really WAS glowing. i always thought that sort of saying was silly and figurative but i truly felt it. i'm learning to love my body and not fight against it for the first time and i'm tearing up laying on my yoga mat right now and it's so SILLYYY but thank you so much adriene. i'm sure you hear this all the time but you touch our lives with such light and love and i'm so, so grateful i committed to this practice.",Ugyj2yTQ1jEF2TuWwvN4AaABAg,1.0,14.0,2018-01-18T16:28:11Z,0.9972673654556274

I'm at home in a t-shirt and underwear on my yoga mat every day with you for the last 12 days. It's been amazing. I'm also a big woman, with a belly and every thing, and most days I've had sweat running down my neck from the practice. I thank you for that too.

520.0,"LAST night I came to the mat in the early evening after taking the dog for walk and so I was ready and wide awake for today's session.

Once again, I struggled with some of the stretches, especially the one where you from plank to left and right twists to the floor.  I would love to know an alternative to this practice because it also popped up in today's (Day 13) and my feet kept on slipping out from under me and I was having an awkward time on the mat, but once again, I really came out of the whole experience feeling so much better.  There is definitely something with this yoga that is making me feel really good at the end and I can understand why so many people take this journey and stay on it.  

I am also challenging myself and by doing this it gives me something to achieve along the way, especially when poses and positions crop up again and again. It is also good to know that Adriene also has a routine with the days, and so you get use to what is to come next.  While following along Adriene said something about taking your time moving with the flow and I said to myself ""it's not the destination, its the journey"" when she said about not rushing to get to the pose/position ... so from now, I am seeing where I am on going and I am being surprised as what is at the end destination when we arrive.  The destination is a bit over 15 days and what will I experience on this journey will depend on what I want to put into it, and how I will treat myself and what I will learn along the way.  

I am looking forward to staying on this path as the journey so far has been so good that I do feel calmer and refreshed after each day on the mat.",UgxR-QD-3qnGw8XUjnV4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2018-01-15T01:51:44Z,0.9981826543807983

I mean, not that it is interesting or important in sense of comparison, but it certainly is important, looking through the doors of my perception, in sense that THIS is the thing that we should explore more deeply – ourselves. To tend to understand our bodies, minds, this miraculous form of matter that we are in to. And by that be able to accept it as it is. Be really into it. Speaking from that point of view, to me as a human being is really significant what is happening here. Thank you Adriene! Few days ago you said that this is beyond your wildest dreams. For sure it is, and I bow to your courage which make you to dare to dream with eyes wide open.

653.0,"The initiation of the movement from the lunge to Warrior 2 was SO interesting - it reminded me of the way my t'ai chi instructor used to teach us to move always s-l-o-w-l-y from our center, or our dan tien, which is if I remember correctly a couple of inches below the navel and a couple of inches into  your center/core (ish). Being reminded of the power (and difficulty!) of slowing down and moving from my core in this context was a fascinating hybrid/meeting of two worlds for me --  brought something I loved about that martial art to my yoga practice yet via a totally different type of movement, which was a very powerful (and pleasurable!) experience.

858.0,"Really resonate with this one. Appreciated the exercise! This focus on the center is speaking to this weird energy place that you've helped me discover over these past months:  if I focus ""in"" it, I can hold in plank for ages vs. when I focus on holding with my muscles I shake and it's killah!  It feels like this center place is more than just center of gravity.  Frankly sometimes when  I'm in the zone it kind of feels like that core space is floating suspended by a string that *defies* gravity!

But at the end I could very clearly feel the imbalance between left and right sides in my body - it  feels like my core is very subtly swaying (or more *spiraling* actually) between them.  If you've read this far down ;-) does anyone have any suggestions for  poses/sequences to unify/knit/integrate sides/energies etc and address this little cyclone of energy in my gut - I think it's throwing me off balance.  It's fascinating that I can feel in my body the results of a head/heart challenge in my life off the mat.  

Just gotta pause a moment too and say: Imagine that 8 months ago I had no idea this world inside even existed!  Thank you Adriene!!",UgxpJiEb83LbmP7SWFZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-13T15:20:39Z,0.9922365546226501

My back pain level has significantly decreased. And that where my daily yoga starts. I recently finished your 30 days of yoga, and I feel so empowered. Now, Im doing both your series of Revolution in the morning w/c help me start my day energetically (bye grouchy morning) and the True in the evening w/c helps me sleep earlier and longer (adios to my long time buddy, insomnia!)

908.0,"I wasn't having a great start to my day, I showed up to my mat and tried to really focus in on the practice, but I kept losing concentration and feeling overwhelmingly emotional, so I stopped the video. After 10 minutes I continued the video, feeling somewhat better,  the practice today was so insightful into my current mind space. To focus and remember to move from my center on and off the mat, because I know all the answers I need are within my center, I should listen and trust it more.

991.0,"Thanks so much for taking the time and effort to make this series. It's been incredibly helpful to soothe my Fibromyalgia and rebalance my nerves. I wanted to give you the feedback that I always find it incredibly useful when you remind us to soften our jaw or bring our hips in or belly buttons to the back body, etc. Those reminders are so helpful, as I am always getting tight in the jaw, neck and shoulders without realising and I get so focused on ""pulling off the move"" that I forget the point sometimes, so this series has been an invaluable foundation to my practice. Thanks so much!
