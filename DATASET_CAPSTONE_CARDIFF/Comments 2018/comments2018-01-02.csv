0.0,"It's Day 1! Welcome everyone. Have I told you how awesome it is for you to say yes and commit to a 30 Day Yoga Journey? Seriously - you are awesome. Today's theme is motive. 

We often rely on motivation to come from an outside source. But what if you realized that it could come from within?

We begin with focusing on motive because aligning with the reason why you are here sets the tone for what you will experience on the journey. 

If you are here to smell like a fart and feel lousy then you will likely accomplish that. 

A student‚Äôs motive to go to school is to learn. 

What is your motive for join TRUE? Now, wait! Stick with me!If you do not know your MOTIVE yet - that is 100% OK! It‚Äôs perfect. It will likely reveal itself and feel amazing when it does. If it does. We are here to uncover and circle back to that feeling of‚Ä¶ you. 

The true you. 

The real you. 

~ Share with us your motive down below! What is your reason for committing to TRUE? 


PS: 100% okay to not know your motive yet!!!",UgxVHvO9TO1d8AnWwxd4AaABAg,135.0,1288.0,2018-01-02T16:48:20Z,0.9973025321960449

Loved the gentle start to this one, especially as I'm still trying to remember my core and engage the whole body in each pose. Today I learned a bit more about how to take the pressure out of my knees in warrior 1 by using the back leg and foot more actively. I am still struggling (and have throughout) with the fact that I feel like I'm constantly repositioning arms and legs - for example when moving through the cat/cow variation at the beginning. Felt like I was having to move my hands forward in order to get head to earth, but then pull them back when coming into cat pose. Is this normal?! I don't know. 
Either way I feel like the cobwebs have been blown away and I'm now ready to start prepping for my first interview in months! Thanks again and see you tomorrow :-)",UgyrXXNM1cXWgLY8-3h4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2020-06-30T10:40:06Z,0.9976897239685059

While I've apreciated it since the beginning, I had started to feel a bit uneasy about my inability to take the teaching off the mat with me. It did help me feeling more peaceful and serene, but no big changes in my everyday life. So my motivation today was to feel more connected to the spiritual teaching of the practice. And just then, out of nowhere, when Adrien told us to hug ourselves with love, I suddenly felt the enormous impact of that love. How precious it is that I love myself and that I always have my back. It was an overwhelming sensation and it changed my motivation for this journey altogether: my motivation is to learn to love myself with the awareness that I've sperimented today.

355.0,"This is my third 30-day yoga journey. I did 30 days of yoga last fall and it took me something like 75 days because I needed to repeat many of the practices. Then I did Home in January of 2020 and I loved that. I mostly, but not completely did that in 30 (plus a few) days. The great thing is that I've done some yoga every day since then. And what a difference it's made in my body, but also in my spirit and my mind. I am so grateful. This set of 30 practices I started just after Home finished, but then life had other ideas about how I should be and many changes have come down the pike--for me and for the world. Now on this new start, I am learning how to support my very strong Mom who is far away and very recently widowed, learning how to be a fatherless child (at age 54--my dad, who was a free spirit in so many ways while living is now all spirit--and I feel his legacy moving through me and my family daily), and finding the need to reinvent my livelihood in the face of COVID-19 along with what seems like the rest of the planet. I am daily finding many silver linings in all of these ""clouds."" and Yoga everyday with an invitation to contemplate the inner world is so helpful.

I also added a Shavasana  at the end with a 5min mindful meditation. I managed to ""watch my thoughts go by"", something I always have trouble with!! 

I'm gonna say how, maybe ir's useful for someone:
I imagined the metaphor from Headspace ad, which is watching the traffic go by. I imagined each thought as a car, and the driver was the part of my personality that the thought was about. The key was to imagine the DRIVERS to have my thoughts. For example, a student driver was worrying about exams.

743.0,"Day 1/30. I've only taken 3 yoga classes in my life and the last one was over 10 years ago. I knew going in that this was going to be a challenge. The poses themselves were very doable, yet for me also physically challenging. I could feel how tight, and so out of alignment every part of my body is. This was upsetting (although I already knew I was out of alignment and out of shape), but it was also encouraging that I could feel down to the cellular level and pinpoint specific places and really FEEL my body and soul.  When you had us pull our arms in to hug ourselves the first time, tears immediately came to my eyes and a couple of them traveled down my cheeks.  I think this is going to be a very challenging yet cleansing experience for me, probably more so in the area of emotional/mental growth.  At the end when we brought our hands up to our third eye I saw a diamond shaped bright light that had a slightly blue or indigo tint to it.

754.0,"I am 59 yr 3 mo old, 65 in tall and a 136 lb woman in a 238 lb body. I have literally been in bed for 26 mo after ending a 7 yr experiment in returning to the entry level career I left in 1986. I have gained about 50 lbs in this depression episode & am up from 147 on June 28, 2012 when I had minimally invasive open heart surgery to repair my prolapsed mitral valve. I took my first yoga class in 1978 when my body weighed 136 lb and was 18 years old. I never became an expert but have gone to many fitness classes, been quite fit and weighed from 112 to 248 lb. in that time. Last Tuesday I went to a yoga class 5 mi up the river from where I live in rural Virginia. It may not have been quite as significant as college graduation but just getting there may have been the most significant thing I have ever done! I went to two studio classes this week but I can't afford to go that much so I am going there once a week and practicing at home between. I started the original 30 Days on Friday. Yesterday at about 22 minutes in Day 2,  I realized I might have to find a way to do 45 days of yoga. I literally cannot move from down dog to runners lunge due to the weakness of my body & it's bulk. So much of my postmenopausal weight is around my waist that it is like trying to work out with an tire tube around my middle. I just found this new offering so I will go through some beginning sessions that I have found and try to do 15 or 20 minute sessions a couple of times during the day to get my strength built up & then start this new 30 Days series. I cannot even say how thankful I am for your YouTube classes. Yoga classes are not affordable for low income people like me where I live so you are literally saving my life.

After a super tough year there was no question , I knew what I had to do! Having followed you on and off for years there was also no question that you were to be my guide! My husband and my daughter have also started yoga and the transformation for all of us has been incredible and the more I do the more I need to do! I can‚Äôt help but spread the yoga message and I always recommend you! My daughter just turned 12 and she really notices a difference if she misses a day. People go to classes weekly which is great but to truly embody yoga on and off the mat ,for me, daily practice is the key! So thank you again from my heart to yours, you are incredible, I love your vibe , your humour and your singing! Never stop doing what your doing! Yoga can change the world !

I have to say, I think I might like yoga better; it's the perfect mix of meditation and exercise. It's still WAY out of my comfort zone, but I had fun doing this fist video and realized something about myself:  I'm definitely as stubborn as I think I am! Lol. I didn't think I would be able to do some of the movements/poses, but I found I could if I really stuck to it, and realized it was more the transitions I had trouble with. Your video is fantastic, and I can't wait to do more!! Here's to another 29 days!",Ugw3PsM0wt-lqIkR3Tt4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2018-07-10T03:06:23Z,0.8799508213996887

My motives are to do something relaxing for me just before i wake up my little boy, to become peacefull as i was when i was younger, before i became serious and depressed by all the problems that i met. 
I couldn't see the beauty for long time... I endly have understood that its all in my head and about self love.
But its not easy to stay on top of the mountain. 
I want to find the balance to not fall in my deap black holes anymore. I truly believe that yoga And m√©ditation can take me there where i want to stay.
And one or my motives is also to grow old in a fit body, to stay independent as long as possible.

So when you started doing Downward Facing Dog, I actually paused the video and nearly gave up and said welp, this is too difficult for me. But then I remembered that you said something about doing what feels right for your body and not doing what doesn't feel right, and I also remembered the motive I thought of at the beginning of the video, because the first thing I thought of was that my motive is to remember that I can do things that are difficult. I have a bad habit of giving up on things that I think are too hard or things I can't do perfectly the first time, and I wanted to remember that I am capable of more than I think. Soooo even though a part of me felt silly, I did plank instead of downward facing dog and finished the video, and you know, that's better than nothing, so thank you!

currently it's 4 am and i'm feeling weird and tired so i thought it's time to start this journey ! i'm going start now then run myself a warm bath and drink my tea and hopefully i would sleep earlier. 
i made it through all the previous 30 days yoga  journeys but i never really had a goal but with this one my goal is to end  the 30 days with me practicing yoga early in the morning but nit before i sleep but after i wake up !!!

Last year was bit of a struggle for me with yoga, can't explain why, I just didn't practice it as I would have wanted to.

1681.0,"i started practicing yoga at the end of 2016/beginning of 2017 with adriene's other 30-day challenges. from there i practiced almost every day, and as someone who had never maintained regular physical activity/exercised, i was stunned by how much my body changed. i fell out of practice for 4-6 weeks at the end of 2017 as i struggled to finish a challenging final semester and graduate college, and chose to spend winter break relaxing in the company of my friends and family and eating good food instead. i started the challenge today and it was humbling just to sit for a few minutes at the beginning of the video and remember what that feels like on my spine.  it's intimidating to get back into practice! in my life outside of yoga, i also face an intimidating, new, transitional period that causes me anxiety and uncertainty. doing this practice today, though, felt so emboldening and refreshing. adriene really is the best teacher and sweetest guide! i am so excited to get back into practice with her and use movement to guide me through the uncertainty of the rest of my life situation outside the mat. :)",UgxSZagU4RywG2GmCfF4AaABAg,0.0,5.0,2018-01-15T18:18:04Z,0.9972302317619324

2095.0,"I just finished day 1, a few days behind but I‚Äôm happy I found this. I thought a lot about my motive for opting for a series that changes every day as I usually find one series and stick it out for a while. I have chronic back pain and I would normally pick a class that is geared toward people with back pain and usually beginners. I‚Äôm not really a beginner and the yoga for back pain hasn‚Äôt helped my back pain. I spend most of my day thinking about moving because I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs going to hurt. It‚Äôs exhausting! So I need a different approach. By choosing a program that changes daily I can‚Äôt get into habit and manipulate myself to where there is no pain, there is also no challenge and no improvement. Also, since I‚Äôm not familiar with the daily content I can spend 20 minutes thinking about what I‚Äôm doing and how I‚Äôm feeling instead of pain. So my motive is to not think about hurting and hopefully I‚Äôll just stop hurting. :) Thank you for coming up with his series.",Ugy3J9lIx05rgx33eNh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-05T13:42:37Z,-0.9171720743179321

2396.0,"I CAN NOT believe I am actually part of this yoga journey after discovering Adriene last month and doing the Yoga Revolution in my own time.

I have so much of a wonderful expectation as to what this yoga journey will entail and on the first day, I have not been disappointed.  

I came to the mat late (s I only completed this session less than an hour ago) so I feel as though I am already a day behind, but I am in a good place.

When it comes to my motive behind doing this challenge, I am happy to say, I am doing this as a way of keeping myself from sitting on the couch and to continue with my wellness journey that I began last month.

In one of my entries on the revolution journey, I said this my Eat, Pray, Love journey and for me, Yoga is Pray ... I discovered through the revolution journey that I needed to be more kind to myself and this is what I am continuing to practice through this journey.  

I am staying true to myself by treating myself with kindness but at the same time challenging myself through the 30 days.  At times, I know I will be pushing myself to be switched on for the day, but I have made the commitment that I will work through these sessions and take each day as they come.  I am not creating a false image of what I want to achieve at the end of this journey, I am going to be taking each day as it comes and allowing these moments on the mat to be my time to connect with my breathe and with realities that may or may not come up on this journey.  Reality on the last journey was to be kind to yourself ... 

If there is any life lessons to be learnt on this journey, I am open to accept them just like I did while on the revolution journey.  It is amazing but sometimes, you just need someone to say something that you had been telling yourself or something that you had been needing to hear because you know that over time it is a truth you had been searching for but you didn't know what it was ...  

Coming to the end of the revolutionary journey, I realised I was treating myself as though I had overcome my cancer treatment and I am fine and life was back to where I was before ... but in reality, I needed to find more time to recover and I found out that my mental health had been affected to the point of being diagnosed with depression ... so finding yoga through my Doctor has made me slow down, accept where I am now and that I need to take time out for me.  I am still finding it hard to slow down, but with these minutes on the mat, I feel as though I am connecting to what is important for me now ...",UgyDDdxODxrzkofMBqZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-03T11:10:35Z,0.5875982930651763

Today my shoulder was hurting like it had a serious injury, and my neck and back were locked up so much that it was like being in a painful, metal brace that was wrapped around my torso. Stretching into the pain is interesting. It hurts like hell, but it's a good hurt, and afterwards I feel better for a while.

I'm amazed at how tight and stiff my body has gotten in these past few months. At a couple points during this video, as much as this would have been an absolute breeze for me a few months ago, I was in pain. I'm going to get back in touch with myself and it's going to be beautiful.

2428.0,I started following you and practicing yoga nearly 2 years ago which got me to eventually sign up to a yoga centre for nearly a year where I learnt a lot about correcting my postures but I decided to go back to doing it at home with you. I need a lot of motivation to do it at home even though I always feel great after and so happy I did it so starting this challenge in the new year is really helping motivate me. I hadn't practiced yoga for a couple of months before starting again and wow did I need to stretch! Feels great so I'm really excited to getting it back into my routine again.

2442.0,"oh adriene, i've been away from you for too long. about a month and a half. i re-started doing pilates in an attempt to shape my body more quickly for my upcoming teeny courthouse wedding + bali honeymoon which is awesome, but i've been missing you. and doing this video just made me realize how much. i've been trying not to focus negatively on my body too much, but i gained ~13% of my ""usual"" body weight over the past few years. all good happy relationship weight, but it's lingered longer than any weight spike i've ever had in my life before, and i've felt somewhat out of place in my body. and can feel myself becoming more and more critical of my body the longer the weight stays on me. when you asked what our motive was at first i didn't know. and then while you were talking it flitted into my mind, so right and so real and so TRUE-- my motive is to spark (or feed or lean into, if you will) my light. take it out from under it's proverbial bushel. i realized while i sat listening to you that that's what i really want when i picture myself on my honeymoon and the day i marry my husband and the day after that and the day after that. i want to feel playful and alive and connected and strong and beautiful in my body. i want to smile and laugh and be graceful and WOMAN. i want to be LIT. so, my motive is to lean into and feed my light. <3

I'm not sure if I should say I'm in my best shape ever or my worst, but I don't think it matters anymore.  What DOES matter is treating my body well and I know that if I do that, it will transform.

I'm a cashier at a big Michigan superstore (that isn't MalWart) and one of my customers told me about your channel and your upcoming 30 days of yoga for the new year. I recognized the name and went to check out some of your videos. Turns out, I've watched some of your videos before! Yoga for Headaches, Yoga for Bedtime, Yoga for Absolute Beginners, and a few others. It was a nice surprise to rediscover this channel.

My motive for these 30 days is to become healthier. Mentally, physically, spiritually, and any way that will help me improve my health.

2594.0,"I had a dream last night that I was a new firefighter recruit. There was a pretty big group of about 30 of us. As the alarm rang and a group of us hopped onto the fire truck for our first real call, I felt a flash of worry, that I don't know what I'm doing and what if I mess up. But then I was quickly assured that we were all in the same boat, and we will make some mistakes as we learn, and that's okay. What followed was such a deep sense of purpose and drive, of tight-knit camaraderie, that I was making a real difference and what I did mattered. That I was fulfilling my purpose.


I hadn't felt those things in over 7 years. At all. I've been trapped under a thick and paralyzing depression that has refused to let up despite throwing every conceivable type of therapy at it. It's been sapping every bit of my life energy, leaving me not much more than a hollow shell many days. In this dream it was like something woke up within me, and it ironically couldn't happen unless I was asleep. In reality I have zero desire to be a firefighter, but I long to regain that sense of purpose. And so that's my motive, starting day 1 of this yoga program and heading into the new year.

2751.0,"Hello Adrienne, and my YWA community members! My motive in doing this is to find peace, love, and self-care in my everyday life. I would like to learn to take things slow and to take a more active role in my life and in myself -- to take the time to check in with my body and my mind and the world. I also am searching for a deeper love and sense of connectedness with my body. I have been overweight my whole life, and have often struggled with a sort of lack of agency over my body -- feeling like I couldn't love and respect it and possess it wholeheartedly as my own because it was ""ugly"" or ""unhealthy."" I want to improve my health, but I feel that first I need to improve my relationship with myself. Yoga has helped me to accept my body as my body, and helped me to own it.

I want to say a huge thank you to Adriene and everyone in this community for supporting me, even if they didn't know they were doing it. Finding ways to ""work out"" or even just to find some movement can be hard when you're overweight, because you feel so ashamed and as if you don't belong. So thank you to Adriene for making movement about self-love, for making me feel as though my body is lovely, and as though I can do anything. Thank you to Adriene for teaching me to find what feels good rather than to punish myself for my perceived faults. This has truly been a breakthrough for me. I'm so excited to take things even further during ""True.""",UgxgOZDm7qSWNGf6Ox54AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2018-01-03T01:18:06Z,0.9985344409942627

I've loved cat/cow in the past but have never done a cat/cow variation before....wow that felt really amazing!!! 
I'm just curious if anyone has ever kept sort of a yoga journal? I've felt the urge to start doing this for a couple of years but yet never followed through. Not that I want to force myself to do ""homework"" or anything, lol, but thought it would be cool to have a few notes about my practise each day, what I struggled with, which poses I loved, etc..especially to look back on later. If anyone else has this ritual I would love to hear any tips you have for me! <3",UgzqM9LtHdWzkmEHbsl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-03T00:19:25Z,0.9941695928573608

3014.0,"Thank you Adriene.  I have done your 30 days of yoga in the past - this is my third time! Why am I back? Daily yoga doesn't just get my abs closer to appearing, it also gives me a serenity that I carry through my day.  It makes me feel supported, strong, flexible, peaceful and happy.  I have to thank you for that Adriene.  When I do other yoga practices I do come out of it feeling peaceful.  But only in your practices do I also feel filled with joy.  No one makes yoga come alive like you.

I want to say thank you, for being a compassionate motivator in my life. I am so happy to say that on December 30th, I DID IT! I fully committed to me, even on the worst days with plenty of distractions.. I did it! this sense of accomplishment has bled into every area of my life. even washing dishes is now exciting and a chance to connect to myself.

then magically, I saw you were beginning another 30 day yoga series, immediately following the month I randomly chose to pick this up. this feels like gold to me... like Spirit is inviting me deeper into this commitment, aligning perfectly with your beautiful commitment to serve and bring people to themselves.

today on Day 1, my motive is to imbue this body with spirit, embody this energy, and be in gratitude for all gracious gifts given. THANK YOU!",UgzXbhFCLaZpF5arglx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-02T21:44:21Z,0.9997771382331848

I was a nursing student for 4 years and I think in my 3rd year I discovered yoga with Adriene. I was batteling with anxiety and stress in that time and it actually hasn't stopped, although it is better. Now I am starting to work as a professional nurse in about a month, and I can already feel the fear and anxiousness creeping up.

Today I realised that by doing true I will be able to explore more on my inner self and my spiritual an physical wellbeing.

And ultimately that my intention. To focus and be mindful od my physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing.

We really ARE more than just our own bodies, and the more people explore this concept and find the truth of it in their own experience, the more authentic happiness and sanity can begin to flourish.

While I was hugging myself, I started to cry and all of the self hate I've been struggling with for years just broke me down.

I've been doing your yoga videos since June or July of 2017 and although I haven't gained a whole lot of love for myself yet, I can feel it working through me during each video I participate in, and I have the ability to actually pause and listen to my body and relax my mind in meditation because of your videos. My intention for starting this practice is to take more steps along the path to self love and to understand fully that I am truly not just my body. I want to thank you for all of this‚ù§Ô∏è for giving me a place to work on myself in a community of love and care and togetherness. I feel like a true yogi as I practice with you.

Not in the sense that I don't know who I am, but more of what does God need me to do for Him on this earth? There are people to help, and so often we turn our focus to ourselves, when there are so many who need us. And if we just take the time to reach out, we won't only bless their lives but ours will be forever changed as well. We will feel a deep love and connection for others and a great peace in our lives.¬†
My motive, is become connected with myself and God on a deeper level throughout my practices that I can hear His inspiration and do His work each day.¬†

I would like to take a moment to say thank you for all the work hard work you put into your channel, your videos, & thank you for keeping it so real. I started doing yoga over two years ago. I turned to yoga while in a depression & I came across your channel. I love your authenticity. You really helped bring me out some of the darkest times in my life. you always make me smile at least once during each session. You don't know me & it sounds funny to say but I feel like we're friends for the simple fact that I can really feel the energy you send out when you making these videos. I can tell you put a lot of love in it. You've helped me heal many times. I hope you get to read this! Again Thank you for all you do & I hope you keep making videos for a long time to come. The world needs more people like you Adriene. Much Love to You & Benji. -Priscilla L. Chicago,IL

I have written to you before but never got a response back.  At the moment I am pregnant and because I was on bed rest 2 months ago the dr.  told me I am not aloud to do any exercise.

3906.0,"I am proud that I have decided to do this, but I also worry that I am not going to be able to give it what it deserves. Because of exams and various other personal and school-relate struggles, I know that once my holidays end I will not be able to give this journey priority, as I always prioritise my school work. 
This makes me feel guilty for subscribing when I am pretty sure I won't be able to fully complete it... 
But then, one of my motives is to stop worrying and embrace self love, and even doing a few of these videos is better than none I guess...

Some advice though, please! If I miss a day or few because I am too busy/away/tired etc. should I miss it out and move on the next day, or try and keep up and then delay the program past the end of January? I wouldn't be able to do 2 on one day to catch up.

3950.0,"Adriene, I've tried to do your previous 30 days versions but I've always had to abort it. Thing is, my upper body and wrists are so weak. After a few days my wrists ached 24 hours so I had to stop. What I have the most issue with is downward facing dog and full plank since that's when I put the most weight on them. My arms are also weak and have issues supporting me but I think they would last if not my wrists gave up first. Do you have any suggestion? Something I can do to strengthen them? And also, something I can do when you perform downward facing dog and plank that is not the same, but still good for me? I really wish to continue to follow this series :)  
I truly love listening to your voice and take a moment on the mat to calm down. I had a rough 2016 and 2017 so I've been stuck in a negative mindset, but I let that go when I go on the mat and I just focus on me. I love that feeling. Afterwards I take that positive energy I've built up and brings it with me. So I really want to continue without hurting myself.

The past couple of months have been pretty hard mentally for me, I have realised a lot of things that were hard to accept but very necessary for growth in 2018. I easily get overwhelmed by big goals and tend to procrastinate until it's too hard for me to make any progress at all, but I am determined to make this year all about baby steps and a thirty day yoga journey to start it is going to be perfect!
The goal isn't to have done fifteen hours of yoga throughout January, it is to show up for myself every day. Then before I know it, I can look back on January, and see that I have, in fact, completed roughly fifteen hours of yoga, and I can be proud of what I have accomplished instead of dreading the journey to get there. Instead of looking at daily yoga as yet another thing to cross off on my to do list, I am going to embrace it as something to look forward to in order to be able to be the best me I can this year.

4407.0,"Thank you Adrien, My motive is being nice. That's my resolution for the new year. It's so hard to be mindful of and be nice to everyone around us including us. I did the practice today, and found it so difficult to be mindful of the movements and hold the positions. It  was a struggle I admit. I found that my hands and wrists were hurting more than my upper body and that's when I realised that in spite of you telling us to be mindful I was doing all the planks on my fingers extended and not hands planted firmly on the ground. So there you go, it will be a journey to see if I can hold my mind and body together. Thanks again.",UgxAGdfinyQ7aaApHJR4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2018-01-02T09:11:10Z,0.5963518023490906

UPD. I've noticed you guys like to talk other people what to do and super afraid of asking Adriene for some changes. You dont have to do these things.
