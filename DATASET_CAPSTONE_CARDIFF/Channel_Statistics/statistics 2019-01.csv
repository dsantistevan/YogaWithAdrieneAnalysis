1,Yoga With Adriene,Dedicate - Day 0 - Welcome To Dedicate |  Yoga With Adriene,"Welcome to Dedicate! This video is the official kick off for your 30 Day Yoga Journey! In this short orientation video I share my top three tips for success with the program. Use today to set an intention and prepare for the journey ahead. You have already said yes to dedicating this time to tone muscle, improve mobility, clear your mind and focus inward. 

If you are healing from an injury or brand new to yoga - you can do this program. You will just need to modify, as will every single one of us at some point on the journey. 

This is a 30 Day Journey about uncovering your authentic self. It’s not about re-creating, emulating or copying someone else. Trust me, trust your self. You just get your butt to the mat and together we will find the rest. I promise.

The practices in this program are absolutely suitable for pregnant women with the use of some modifications. Avoid twists and core work and always ask your doctor for advice based on where you are in your pregnancy. I advise that when in doubt, you supplement your twists and core work with slow and loving breathing.

31,Yoga With Adriene,Dedicate - Day 30 - Liberate  |  Yoga With Adriene,"Welcome to your Day 30 Dedicate practice. This is our final yoga session of this program. Per tradition, today will require you to have faith, keep an open mind, and listen to your body. 

For your day 30 session, I will take off the mic and practice alongside you, encouraging you to utilize all of the tools you have learned on the journey thus far. I will not verbally instruct this session but instead, invite you to lead your way. 

Find freedom within the form, use me anytime you need me. I'm here for you! Check-in for ideas on what to do next, or simply enjoy the music as you move on your own.

Move slow, be mindful, and remember, the breath comes first. 

You cannot go wrong with this practice as long as you trust. 

You have everything you need. And more.

It has been a total honor to be your yoga guide and even more of an honor to be your friend and fellow human in this process and on this journey. 

Remember, it’s not the end. 

It is most definitely the beginning. 

Namaste, 
Adriene
