Today we use yoga and pranayama to light it up. 

Your Day 5 yoga practice is designed to gently stimulate and awaken. As we continue to build our vocabulary, today we focus on synchronizing the breath with the movement. Circulate energy, or prana, and unlock some mojo you have been missing!

This practice sets the stage for you to begin to break up stagnant energy and patterns. Be true to your breath. Experiment. Explore. I will guide you! Just get on that mat.

True: 30 Day Yoga Journey continues! Your day 10 yoga practice is a mindful cleansing practice. Out with the old and in with the TRUE!

Drop your expectations and breathe. 

No one expects you to master or jive with every practice. This journey is about spending time with yourself. Today we focus on building heat from the inside out. Burning away that which no longer serves in order to create powerful transformation. 

This series is not a challenge, it is a journey. But today's practice might be challenging! 

You have everything you need. Continue to ride the wave. Trust, observe, and enjoy!

Listen to what is going on inside. 

Time on the mat is time well spent because it’s time that you get to practice listening. 

If you are here for the hip dips, great. 

But today we refocus on why we are truly here. 

Day 14 is a self-study & mindful mental health practice that is also a delicious and restorative day for the body, particularly your neck, back, and shoulders

Believe in yourself, your uniqueness, your worthiness.

I believe we each have this special unique quality. 

The tools of yoga and the process we allow on the mat help us uncover, reveal, and align with what feels like our true purpose. 

Authenticity.

It is my hope that through this practice we become closer to ourselves and therefore closer to finding out what our meaningful contribution to humanity is. 

All that on the mat?

Yes.

Today we exercise a different set of muscles.

A yoga practice for your mind. 

Today’s session invites you to consider how your thoughts create your reality.

Most tend to know the power of the mind…

Yet we lack the mindful practice of harnessing that power for our own good. 

Today’s HANDS-FREE practice will balance out the work you have been doing with your body and help you feel good. 

It will also surely help you re-focus, re-group, and ground.
