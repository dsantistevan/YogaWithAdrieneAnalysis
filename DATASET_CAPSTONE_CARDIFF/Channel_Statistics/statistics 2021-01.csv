1,Yoga With Adriene,Welcome to BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey  |  Yoga With Adriene,"It is happening! Today‚Äôs video is a bit of an orientation, a warm welcome, and an official kick-off. We will begin with a few easy group breaths to enjoy, and recognize that if all you do is arrive here to breathe, you are winning, golden, exactly where you are meant to be. 

You can consider this a practice day for your upcoming practices if you like. 

**IMPORTANT** If you are not signed up for the daily email that corresponds with each practice video, sign up for free and receive your free BREATH calendar here: https://www.yogawithadriene.com/breath

Work with what you have, but in this video, I make some suggestions on some optional things you might like to bring to class each day, along with an invitation to help guide you as you embark on this unique journey. 

Check-in with your willingness to be present, and remember for this to take off - you have to show up.

If this cross-legged position is not doable for you, you can use blankets, blocks, or pillows to sit up on. You can also come into a chair, or on the edge of your couch when we take this shape. That is a great way to modify and possibly a better spot for you to tune in, work with the breath technique, and warm up before we get moving into other shapes each day. 

Finally, set an intention. Be brave and ask WHY? Why are you here? What do you think pulled you here? And if you don‚Äôt know, that is okay, we will likely uncover that together. (How exciting!)

2,Yoga With Adriene,Day 1 - Invite  |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Your first yoga practice is here, and it is a full one, packed with valuable invitations! We begin by taking things nice and slow. You will soon feel more fire, you may move fast, but this series asks you to be disciplined about bringing awareness to the deeper layers of your practice - with breath. 

What makes this 30 Day series unique is that these practices are designed to work together 1-30, not just as one-offs, though that is time well spent too. 

This series is a process with intention. Today‚Äôs practice is all about listening, respectfully setting the tone, building foundation with slow and with purposeful movement. 

Thank you for joining me on this journey and for sharing this connection with so many people around the world.

3,Yoga With Adriene,Day 2 - Arrive | BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"With each breath we have the opportunity to begin again, to arrive in the present moment. In this foundational phase of this journey, I invite you to see each new practice as a new arrival.

Accept and celebrate that each day will be different. Some days you will have more energy than others. Some days it will seem as though the universe is supporting you to show up, eagerly, and fully. Some days your brain will* make it very hard for you to arrive, and it may seem like the exterior is winning over your interior goals. 

Make your #1 goal to show up on the mat. 

Self-care is learning the practice of meeting your self each day, learning about who you really are, and continuing to arrive to devote to the process of self-discovery, not perfectionism. 

With each breath, a new arrival. 

It‚Äôs a powerful tool, and one we are going to cultivate and celebrate together.

4,Yoga With Adriene,Day 3 - Anchor | BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Today‚Äôs lesson invites us to focus on anchoring the thoughts of a busy mind with the tools of our practice. If you are new to meditation or to yoga, this can be a bit of a challenge, so in this session I introduce a very useful breath technique called Ujjayi to help us train the brain and body to focus as one. 

To learn more about the breath technique featured in this video, you may watch my Ujjayi Breathing video here: https://youtu.be/IQrsJ-yZWV8 

On days where your mind is in the future, or maybe your heart is in the past, this breath can help you ground in the present.

The mantra today is‚Ä¶ 

My breath is my anchor, my anchor is breath.

5,Yoga With Adriene,Day 4 - Listen | BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Listen to the feedback that every gesture gives back to you. Rather than just doing the poses, or doing yoga, trust that the practice really is an art of listening. Listening and responding.

Our vocabulary grows today as we continue on our explorative journey, kicking it off with diaphragmatic breathing. 

Most people do not breathe as well as they can, and I do mean MOST. 

We continue with intentional and intuitive movement to improve our posture today, why? 

So you may breathe better, my dear. 

Re-training the posture is one of the best ways to ensure you are breathing deeply and efficiently.  

When we are breathing deeply and efficiently we invite a WHOLE WELL of benefits our way.

7,Yoga With Adriene,Day 6 - Burn |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Day 6 is here, and it is a 30 Days Of Yoga tradition that on day 6 we focus on the core.

Core centric practices are great for toning muscles that support strong and optimal function (read - less back pain) and, let me just get this out of the way, you will be working all of your abs into a fine fiery burn. 

But this type of work can also be really healing and centering. 

Core work, similar to balancing postures, encourages you to take stock and embody the present moment as a way of creating sustainable strength and stamina. 

While it can sometimes feel discouraging, it is most necessary that you take on the task of beginning where you are today. This is how we evolve, it‚Äôs how we learn to know ourselves better, and it is how we get stronger.

Notice what it feels like to be alive today. 

Burn away that which no longer serves.

9,Yoga With Adriene,Day 8 - Snuggle  |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Who wants to snuggle? (Besides Benji.) Bring an extra blanket or towel and a pillow to the mat today for this restorative practice. Wear something extra comfy! Lay that extra blanket down if you like, and let‚Äôs snuggle up to the sensation and rhythm of the breath in today‚Äôs gentle floor practice. 

Today‚Äôs practice is nice and slow and low to the ground. Medicine for the legs, the hips, the torso, and the spine. But also hopefully some feel good medicine for thine heart too.

10,Yoga With Adriene,Day 9 - Balance |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"We ease in to practice today with a breath technique that can help balance out the brain and body. Alternate Nostril Breathing, also called Nadhi Shodana, is an incredible tool for activating the parasympathetic nervous system which can restore balance - particularly if you are consciously, or subconsciously, living more in fight or flight mode - which is common in such uncertain times. 

We will introduce the powerful play of opposites in yoga asana as well, considering the ways in which we may join steadiness, or STHIRA, with ease, or SUKHA.

I will guide postures today that are there not to discourage you, but to help you play with the concept of how to create a dance for both steadiness and ease, and one that is individual for you. 

I invite you to use this material to check in, learn, and grow. 

Remember, it‚Äôs not about being able to stand on one foot. 

Learn the process of centering yourself, and remember, it‚Äôs a process.

If you fall, I will catch you.

You got this.

We will begin standing today, taking time to ground before we explore different tempos and rhythms. This is not meant to throw you but to help guide you into new territory for a deeper discovery. We continue to learn new vocabulary as well as integrate what we have learned so far to align and find freedom within the form. 

This 22 min practice invites you to continue syncing up with your breath in the most loving way and is designed to leave the whole body feeling tended to.

The quality of that conversation will change from moment to moment, day to day, week to week, year to year. The awareness of this ongoing conversation might change your life. It did mine. 

Gently dropping your ties to the exterior and taking time for yourself is not selfish. 

When you arrive on the mat remember you are there to experience your body, and your breath. You are there to snuggle up to your truth, what feels like home, what feels honest.

Take the time to drop in. 

YOU ARE DOING GREAT!

14,Yoga With Adriene,Day 13 - Feel  |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"The most important aspect to focus on when it comes to the home yoga practice in particular, is not that of perfect timing, ideal energy levels, or fancy gear. It is that you are taking the time to check in each day to connect to your self and to your source. 

To me, this is a beautiful, complete, and highly productive act of self love and self care. 

Each day is going to look and feel a little different. Keep this in mind as we continue to progress on this journey. 

Building on yesterday, we keep our discipline but explore how we may ‚Äúdrop the doing‚Äù and Find What Feels Good.

While we want to continue to be mindful and disciplined about our alignment and action - when we begin to allow ourselves to make intuitive decisions based on how we feel - our experience on the mat can really feel like one that serves and supports the real you.

We focus on creating sensation and space in the body, learning to breathe and move with efficiency, mindfulness, and even sometimes joy - so that when we step off the mat we can continue that practice. 

This way we may proceed to learn and live with more ease. 
This way we have proper energy in the tank to serve others more fully. 

We are approaching the halfway mark!

If you would like, take some time to write about how you are feeling (physically, mentally, and emotionally) after experiencing the first 14 days of this journey!

You may find some helpful writing prompts from me in your Day 14 Breath email. 

This is your time, this is your practice. Take up space, darling. You are so worthy of it all.

I will introduce some foundational elements for the next wave of this journey, as well as offer practice of a new technique called breath ratio. Breath ratios are breath patterns set to counts. They are a wonderful tool for expanding your awareness and ability to control your breath.

They are also full of transformative potential and wonderful to pull out of your tool kit when you are feeling mentally, physically, or emotionally stressed or lost.  

They can be short, or long, but they do require a bit of focus and yes you guessed it‚Ä¶. discipline.

This whole session is low to the ground with a nice therapeutic breath for the arms, shoulders, and wrists. As it is seated, do sit up on your blanket if you have one. If you need to do some or all this practice in a chair or on the edge of a couch, do it. 

This session invites you into the classroom. Let me know how today‚Äôs practice goes for you in the comment section down below.

19,Yoga With Adriene,Day 18 - Center  |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Building on yesterday‚Äôs exploration, this practice is about noticing if you are willing and available to check in with your true self each day. This is one of my favorite practice themes and HUGE in my personal body of work, which asks, ‚ÄúWhat is my relationship to center?‚Äù

Please do not miss this session as I include some of my favorite lessons for growing your practice both in asana and yogic philosophy. If you want to advance, do this work. Step into your power. Learn how to move from center. 

We ease in today, so if you are tired or feeling unmotivated, I got you. Practice slowing down at the beginning of this session, then join me as we mindfully layer to POWER postures.

We will connect to subtle body gestures to make deeper discoveries that may (they will) support you both on and off the mat. 

If you are already wondering what you will do when the 30 Days is over, don‚Äôt worry! I have a red carpet of options ready for you. I will share them soon. 

Please, let me know how this session goes for you down below!

20,Yoga With Adriene,Day 19 - Strength |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"We gain an immense amount of strength from having a conscious and loving relationship with our breath. It is poetic. It‚Äôs practical. Today is a bit of a conditioning practice. Don‚Äôt fret! Remember, you can do hard things. However, strength practice is not just about sculpting and toning, though hear me loud and clear, this ongoing practice will sculpt and tone, it just will, it‚Äôs true. But perhaps more importantly so, this type of breath led work, which is what yoga is, can guide you to gather and build strength in more ways than you could ever imagine. 

Enjoy the relaxing end of this session today! STRENGTH in stillness! Don‚Äôt miss it.

This practice has depth. I‚Äôd love to hear from you in the comment section down below!

21,Yoga With Adriene,Day 20 - Pause |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Take 16 minutes to pause. The focus on breathwork continues today, with an introduction of gentle breath retention. Building on our breath ratios, we will learn to implement a small conscious pause between our inhalation and exhalation‚Ä¶ and the exhalation and the inhalation. Think of it as a circular thing. 

Breath retention has loads of benefits and is safe to practice slowly with mindfulness. If you have serious cardiac and hypertension problems, you can skip it. Stick to the counts and enjoy the benefits of ratios as we all continue to learn to re-pattern so that we may breathe more optimally.

Your ocean breath, which we have learned and used in previous sessions, is a perfect match for Kumbhaka. Combine the two and explore!

22,Yoga With Adriene,Day 21 - Control |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"How you move matters. Today‚Äôs central theme is not just designed to guide breath control, but to also roll out the red carpet for you to expand your mind and your relationship to the mantra Find What Feels Good. What is it like to focus not just on the WHAT, but even more on the HOW? 

The same way that you have to bring the breath, you have to bring the awareness of how you are doing something. You get to design how many layers, you get to pay attention to the details‚Ä¶ or not. You get to decide the flavor. 

How you move matters. The art of quality control. Both on and off the mat.

23,Yoga With Adriene,Day 22 - Renew |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"The next three practices are meant to be a trio, a holy trifecta, the best of friends.
Today‚Äôs session invites you into contemplation on what it means to renew. As with many of these practices this theme is meant to be thought provoking and applicable in more ways than one.

Chewing on the philosophy of yoga and dropping in to wherever you are today, we continue to put the puzzle together, remembering all the wonderful vocabulary we have learned together thus far.

The practice of renewal is powerful! It is one of my superpowers for sure. Anytime I find myself in the struggle zone, I slowly pull this practice out of my tool belt, and find my way back to center with a reverence for both the struggle - and my ability to make my way out to move‚Ä¶ forward.

Before I established my renewal practice through regular yoga I found myself on a hamster wheel. Maybe you can relate? 

If you need it, take today to restore and renew your commitment to this journey. 

This 22 min sesh will fly by. I will meet you there.

24,Yoga With Adriene,Day 23 - Dedicate |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"When we take the time to enrich the quality of our relationship with ourselves we are directly influencing the quality of all other relationships. This session highlights how yoga practice can be a practice of devotion, a dedication to one‚Äôs self, and the way in which that is connected to everything. We continue to dedicate time, attention, and energy to finding conscious breath. 

Today‚Äôs contemplation is split into two parts with the invitation to really devote this time and exploration to what feels authentic and good for you. And, to understand or stay open to the fact that this is not just for you, it is for everyone who may cross your path too. 

1. What does it mean to dedicate yourself and really give yourself over to a practice, a project?

2. This is an opportunity to cultivate generosity and to be of service. Each time we come to practice, join our hands in prayer, come to our appropriate edge. May we also use the energy we cultivate in our practice to send some energy to someone else?

Can we build love and awareness within, dedicate to that, so that we can share it freely with others?

We don‚Äôt stay in our bubble of awareness - we cultivate it to expand it and share our gifts.

If it is difficult, remember this is a practice, it is a training, but we can choose to dedicate ourselves to showing up. Dedicate to the process. Dedicate your attention to your breathing.. and the rest will unfold.

25,Yoga With Adriene,Day 24 - Rejuvenate |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"The practice won‚Äôt always leave you feeling rejuvenated. But I love this idea of coming in close contact with the awareness and understanding of what it feels like to bring energy to something. Often we are energizing things that are not serving us, whether it is through our thoughts, actions, our daily rituals, our habits. 

This practice gives us the tools to notice that where our attention goes‚Ä¶ energy flows.

Today we begin with the breath of fire, to stir the pot energetically, and give you the juice you need for this rejuvenating flow. 

What are you ready to bring new energy to?

Some days it‚Äôs as though all is seemingly in the flow, and some days it feels heavier, darker. Our practice offers us the opportunity to pay attention, to notice, and even prepare for the spills and the dark moments.

And while we cannot prevent them, nor should we, the dark moments are a part of life and of our existence. We can use these tools and our experiences on the mat to prepare for the tough moments.

And for the moments where healing occurs, or the moments where healing is possible. 

The practice offers us the tools and awareness to help prepare us for the important moments on our journey. 

You have been working hard. I think it is so beautiful and heroic for you to keep showing up in this way, it‚Äôs not easy. It is remarkable, and you are building a habit for utmost wellbeing. 

Bring your blanket to class today, if you can. If you want, bring two.
If there is time, take a moment to set up your practice spot with intention. Maybe today you light a little candle, or adjust the blinds.

30,Yoga With Adriene,Day 29 - Believe |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Believe in the power of your conscious breath. Believe you are on your path. The invitation is both simple and profound today. It invites us to recognize how time with conscious breath, contemplation, and mindful movement can lead us toward genuinely believing in oneself. Trusting oneself. Trusting the quality of that relationship as you continue to change, transform, and grow. 

We continue to ride the wave of the breath and remember, the mat is a mirror.
Trust your vocabulary. Trust the integrity that you have been bringing into this practice.

Tomorrow is our final day of the 30 Day Journey. The invitation will look a little different, but the goal is to begin by finding what feels familiar‚Ä¶ and then be open to where your breath leads you. 

If you can, set aside an hour for Day 30. If that just made you panic, use the tool of your breath to stay open. We bookend this journey with two long sessions. 

I am giving you a gentle heads up that tomorrow will be different! I will be asking you to trust, to believe, and to take the tools we have learned together and marry them with your experience to begin a practice that is truly yours.

Have faith. 

Have faith in yourself. 

I promise you, I have your back. 

Let me know how you are feeling on Day 29 in the comment section below! 

If you are not a subscriber to the Yoga With Adriene YouTube channel yet but you have enjoyed this journey, I would be so grateful for you to click that subscribe button. It‚Äôs free and it supports the YWA mission to continue to offer free yoga for all. Thank you.

31,Yoga With Adriene,Day 30 - Begin |  BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"In every end is a new beginning. Today‚Äôs practice is an acknowledgment that the breath is always there for you. If you are ever unsure of how to begin again, may this practice remind you to start with a new breath.

On this final day of the journey I take my mic off and practice with you, alongside you. This is a tradition I have incorporated since my very first 30 Day Yoga offering, and to me this journey would not be complete without this ending and this invitation. Don‚Äôt panic. You have the vocabulary, you have the connection. You have it all. 

Allow one breath to lead you to the next. One present moment to the next. As your guide, as your friend, I will still be here with you. You may always use me as a guide. Trust your vocabulary, trust the integrity that you have been bringing into this practice.

If all you do is lie down on your mat and breathe for the duration of this practice, I think that is great. 

But I think that you will find that you have the curiosity, the energy, the interest, and the trust in yourself to Find What Feels Good and to create and embody your practice.

May you open your heart and mind to having a deeper connection with your breath on and off the mat.

May your heart and mind be open to believing in yourself and the power we receive when we take a breath and begin again. 

I always get emotional on Day 30 because I think this is such a truly special and remarkable, meaningful exchange. Thank you for saying yes. 

I hope that this journey has served you and continues to serve you in the form of regular practice, holding you and celebrating you, for many more days to come. 

May you be inspired well beyond today to keep returning to your practice, returning to your breath, returning to your self.

I would love to hear from you today, drop me a note in the comment section below.
