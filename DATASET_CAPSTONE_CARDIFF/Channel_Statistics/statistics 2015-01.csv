0,Yoga With Adriene,30 Days of Yoga - Start Here,"Welcome! Thank you for joining me for the 30 Days Of Yoga experience! Watch this video before you begin! 

It includes helpful ideas and tips to support you on your journey! Today we begin with this video! Tomorrow - DAY 1 of YOGA. 

 As we transition into the New Year I already feel great about the idea of practicing for 30 days straight. I feel excited about challenging myself, connecting to myself, and learning something new. I am grateful that my body is able to move, that my breath is capable of deepening and I love that I will be doing it with so many others, around the globe.
 
The hardest part each day will likely be getting on the mat. Make time. Stay focused and choose to make the experience your own. This 30 Day practice is intended to support you in finding what feels good in the New Year. So, though it may be challenging to make time for your practice ‚Äì just do it ‚Äì knowing that it is okay to adapt, change, modify, rebel and do your own thang at any time.

But get on the mat. 

Take conscious breaths and stretch each day as a way of connecting to your intentions, your big picture, and ultimately, complete wellness.
 
Why not? Let's reach for the stars!

For today's sequence, come into a beginner's mind. (Bonus if you are a beginner and totally new to yoga!) When we come to this idea of beginner's mind - we open up to all possibilities.

Use this Day 3 practice to check in with balance and connect to your core center. Let go of expectations and stay receptive as you work to build strength and unlock more space. Again, open up to making new discoveries! If you are regular yogi this practice will be a great opportunity to change it up. If you are new to the practice, ROCK ON, you have that beautiful beginner's mind already. Seek opportunities to learn - especially in the difficulties. Everyone, close your eyes when you can, move mindfully, and trust yourself. Breathe. Breathe slowly. This revitalizing and strengthening sequence is great for balance, core & hip check-in, and supports good posture! Explore where you are TODAY.

There are some more restorative practices on the way, I promise! Plus shorter sequences begin to weave in and out! Stick with it!!

6,Yoga With Adriene,Day 6 - SIX PACK ABS - 30 Days of Yoga,"Join Adriene on Day 6 of The 30 Days of Yoga journey! Six Pack Abs! Yogi style. This is a shorter practice to tone the abdominals in a mindful way that feels fun and supportive! Also, almost everyone wants more core strength and tone abdominals. You asked for it!
Use this Day 6 practice to check in with the core. Mindful core training will support your entire practice and whole-body health. While tone abs are something we all fancy (me too) core strength training is so much more than washboard abs or a flat tummy. By building core strength you are supporting the back and all of the muscles that surround your dear spinal cord. By working those muscles we are taking some of our weight off the spine and engaging the entire body. We are more likely to do active, engaging things when the body is strong & engaged. Great for runners, dancers, movers and shakers! Great for grounding the spirit.

Day 8 invites you to slow down, cultivate balance, and CONNECT. We open the hips in this sequence and use the subtle power of the breath to find release and let go. Connect to your spirit, soften, stretch, and relax. 

If you are used to moving fast, this may be a challenge for you. Enjoy the rejuvenating and restorative benefits of yoga and meditation. This should feel AWESOME after the first week of the 30 Day Of Yoga Journey. Relax and enjoy! You deserve it.

In this practice we use the earth to connect, ground, stretch, and lift from. We learn another pranayama or breath technique and of course, have a little fun with a full body practice.

This 20 min yoga sequence has it all! It invites you to go deeper. Re-connect to home, ease, and mother earth. Yeah, I said it. Simple meditation pose is there for you. This yoga sequence also invites you to get low and be human. Explore all lines of movement with the support of the earth. We will stretch, open, and remove stress that has manifested in the body. We will tend to the feet and trek into the unknown! We will connect to our core - and keep returning back to the breath - reconnecting to YOU. 

""It's all happening.""

It may have taken longer than 30 Days - but you did it. You are here, now. You committed to yourself, to a practice that serves, inspires, and moves. Enjoy this celebratory practice and know that you are connected to others around the globe also with the mission to Find What Feels Good. 

Day 30 is ultimately an opportunity for me to show you that really - it is all, you baby. It is an opportunity for you to trust and love. It is an opportunity for you to get a good work out and work-it-out. It is a celebration of our practice and of our community! It's about inspiration. How lucky are we to have this practice to grow and this experience to learn from?! Who would have thought you could appreciate the tools of yoga at home in such a way and be your own boss? Who would have thought you would actually make friends across the globe and connect to a community on YouTube? Not me. But I'm so very glad we did. 

Amazing work my friends. Please, please share your experience down below and stay connected. We have so much potential! This is just the beginning.  

So very grateful for this community - keep rocking!!!

Share this experience with your friends and family!
