95.0,"Loved this practice. I was in the mood for a fiery yoga session today - I did not finish today's to-do list AT ALL, and yoga had to wait til late in the evening, so naturally, my head went straight to ""you have to make up for your failure by exhausting your body now"". The dulce practice was a gentle reminder to be kind to myself, to notice that showing up for myself is enough, that I am enough, and that it is okay to  meet myself where I am at today. Thank you for that, Adriene.
I am being sweet to myself in my everyday yoga practice by closing the session with three gentle kisses on my hands - With the hands still drawn together, I give myself one little kiss on the roots of my hands,  one on the roots of my thumbs, and one on my thumbs. Not sure how this came about, but to me it is a nice way of saying ""Thank you"" and ""I love you"" to myself. I am very proud of this small gesture of everyday self-love, because like most of us, I still struggle with loving my imperfect self from time to time. I guess a little goes a long way, after all.

I've just recently started yoga and I was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia (although it now looks as if I've been struggling with it for half of my life). I started with your basic routines, but I wanted to challenge myself to go further and so decided to dedicate 30 days to Dedicate. And, yes, I am finding some positions very challenging. I'm writing this having just completed day 15. I like to view the next day so that I can prepare my mind for the next day's routine. Thank you again for sharing your time with us. Please give  Benji a big hug from me. He's so patient. My wife Fiona and I have been doggy people in the past. We once had a nutty springer spaniel, a soppy black lab (that used go running up the garden with her hackles up even if a leaf dropped) and a lovely tri-coloured border collie (that would howl like a wolf if the phone rang when we were out). It's lovely to make contact with you. Hope have an awesome as you're probably just getting up to a new Monday morning. Take care, kindest regards

173.0,"Adriene, yesterday I was super exited about this practice, something about the name ""dulce"" seemed so attractive to me! And I was right, it was so good. For a while it kinda felt meh bc I felt like I wasn't breathing right (self critisim 10/10 hahah), but i ended up crying at the end. In a very good way. It's not very easy for me to cry even when I really need it. And now I can't stop crying. It's been like 5 or 10 minutes since it ended but I still have that feeling of being sensitive about other people's stories and stuff. Last year's (i think it was last year) TRUE started an important chain of me realizing singing wasn't really my thing (after 6 years of practice and learning and dreaming and planning). This year Dedicate feels good on itself and today I don't care much about what it gives me at the end. I just feels good. It feels good to do it and to live. Thanks. I'm not in the most succesful time in my life business and career wise, but i just feel so good  while crying right now. I wanna keep crying. And right now I feel like I wanna do Dedicate after day 30. So thank you for this yoga masterpiece, Adriene. And I mean that fully. Masterpiece. The good thing about these things is that you never know what to expect ;)

I have followed your practice since 2015, but never been a part of the e-mail you send out every day, it is my new years resolution for next year, since i forgot this year... I wrote you a couple of years back on your webpage, and explained how you've changed my life and how i look at being alive. Today i write you because i have a question. The 30 day yoga challenge 2015 is still my favorite to follow, because you focus a lot on the neck and the shoulders, with streching, neck rolls and so on. Is there any way that you perhaps next year can coorporate a bit more of that into the practice? i am a bit behind in days at the moment, because i've had use some of your other videos to tend to it. I do yoga almost every day year around because it makes a difference, and i am gratefull for all your hard work that we can get so many benefits from.

Once, about more than 10 years ago while in a yoga session, the instructor said to the class that at some point the body may also respond emotionally while we are being physical.

I've been doing your videos for two years now.

Today I saw my othropedic dr.     2.5 months in and he was amazed at my progress.   He went as far as suggesting that he hire me to consult with his patients for rehabilitiation as I've far exheeded anyone he's seen at the 3 month mark.  :)  ha ha .  He was just kidding but he gave me a A++++    I have to thank you-  I believe it's my past yoga practices with you.. every day for almost two years and my current ones- which I tailor to what my body can do.... just as you suggest to us... which has made me his star patient.

I just joined a new gym and signed up for ""orientation"" to find out today that that means a free session with a trainer that tries to break you. I'm also going through PT (which the trainer knew about but didn't take into account) and am sore from that... I wanted so badly to stay the course with Dedicate but wondered if today was the day I needed to take off. Luckily I saw your posts on IG and remembered that day 16s tend to be so lovely and rejuvenating. YAAAAAYYYY!!!! 

Now, I have changed PT to a clinic (is that the right word?) that isn't overstaffed and unwilling to educate. And training is going on the back burner while I gain a little more strength and try out what the gym has to offer IN MY OWN WAY. Whew! I'm responsible for this body and this life.... I choose to spend it with you and others that encourage me in a way that feels right. Looking forward to a good night's sleep and another day of learning to be the best me tomorrow.

757.0,"Almost 2 years ago, I decided to start doing yoga to lose some weight and feel better. I didn‚Äôt have a specific goal in mind. I just knew that I needed to be in better shape and I really didn‚Äôt like how I felt in my skin. I started practicing Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube. I did yoga every day for 30 days. I started drinking more water, going for walks and eating smaller portions. I never weighed myself and still don‚Äôt. I felt like giving up and did not finish every practice, but I didn‚Äôt quit. After the 30 days, I kept going. I do yoga every day; some days are easy, some are difficult. I enjoy this practice because Adrienne will tell you to listen to your body and find what feels good. If you can‚Äôt go all the way today, then go half way and that‚Äôs okay!  Slowly I began to feel better. I started noticing I could walk and breathe better. I could chase around a kid and not feel like my legs were going to fall off. And yesterday, I bought a pair of pants in a size medium! I think the last time I was in a size medium was middle school. I‚Äôm not trying to be a certain size or be sexy or impress anyone. I just want to feel better. And I do. I hope my journey can help you and I send all of you positive thoughts.",UgzxNH-3kK7Le2KVpi54AaABAg,13.0,404.0,2019-01-17T18:01:22Z,0.997384250164032

I really want to say that I love the journey that you created for us and yourself, so that we can take it together!  I am so grateful for that and enjoying it so much! Thank you <3 

Another think I want to comment on is: I love the way how you are going first, when it comes to being kind and playful with yourself (and others). Especially in this video today.. I loved the little giggles when you ‚Äûmessed‚Äú something up. That is exactly what selfcompassion sounds and looks like. Very enjoyable and inspirational! You are making it easier for people to learn about self compassion because you are going first and you are expressing the principles and you show how one can interact kindly with themselves. 

I am a big fan of your self compassion and kindness focus. And I also want to appreciate your Go-giver mentality to create that journey for us for free and so valuable. I also love how you express yourself very genuinely as yourself that really creates authenticity and a bond. No wonder that you are so successful ;)

Since starting yoga, I picked up a lot of goods in my life, better health, clearer mind, peace, being fit, daily exercise and thousands other benefits for my body, mind, and soul. Can't really thank you enough for making this available for us. After awhile Yoga has became not just a chore or ""I have to do this"" thingy for me, but rather a ""I need to do this"" addiction, but not quite. I want to do it, it feels good, and my body, my mind, and my soul love it. So I have no trouble taking up yoga like my morning cup of coffee :D even on my worst days I still managed to get at least 5 mins of yoga. It becomes my passion I guess.

Thank you for showing up Adriene !! 
Thank you for being here and sharing your passion with us.
Thank you for being so self less and making it all for free.
Thank you for acknowledging us as friends,
Thank you for embracing our authenticity altogether.
Thank you for impacting, educating millions of us in Yoga.

I do however find it necessary to always pay myself and my body a little sweetness and love first, by doing this sweet indulging workout/yoga practice to re-connect with my freedom and the sweet side of life. This looks cozy so i'm really gonna make the most out of it. I hope people that do this at the same time as me do and feel so too. Let's keep the dulce going everybody, this cannot get any better, and more delicious. You're all fabulous, keep at it till the end.
