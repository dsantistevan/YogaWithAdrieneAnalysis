I have been following your channel for years and I am eternally grateful for the love, wisdom, and kindness your videos continue to generate in my life and in lives across the world. I started the Dedicate practice at the beginning of March when the unhealthy patterns of communication in my relationship became too much to handle. I stood my ground -- understanding that love and disrespect do not co-exist -- and I asked for space. I dedicated this entire month of separation to rediscovering and reigniting the love I have for myself and your teachings have helped immensely. Thank you for the on-going love and light.

With that said I have been striving for acceptance of imperfection and I promised myself I was just going to start this challenge and if I missed some days that would be okay! (I get the point and the power behind dedicating to 30 days in a row...for many that is the whole point hence the name dedication) So some may believe this is defeating the purpose! For me I am dedicating to doing my best without being hard on myself. I missed practicing when I missed most of last week but I was happy to get back on track this week. When I told myself I love you I of course began to cry, reminding myself to not be hard on myself and give love. Love love love all of this!

It was humbling to feel weak in down dog, but I was also grateful to begin again. Over the last 18 days, I've kept showing up even when I didn't want to. Today, when I got on the mat I felt a laser focus that I haven't felt in a long time. I felt fully CONNECTED to each movement and I felt a fierce strength in my heart. Last year during True, I had a hard time believing that only 20-30 minutes of yoga a day could majorly change me. But that feeling I had today‚Äìof power, centeredness, and love‚Äìis 100 percent proof to me that there is magic here if you have faith and come to the mat again and again. Thank you, Adriene.

""Once when I was running,
from all that haunted me;
to the dark I was succumbing-
to what hurt unbearably.

Searching for the one thing, 
that would set my sad soul free.

In time I stumbled upon it,
an inner calm and peace;
to see and to believe, 
in who I am becoming- 
and all I've yet to be.

693.0,"Love is sticking by someone when no one would blame you for finding too difficult to stay... My best friend, my husband of 9 years and BF for 6 before that started dating me even though I had cancer, stuck with me for my 3rd open-heart surgery, a coma, major abdominal surgery that almost killed me 3 weeks later from a blood clot, pain med haziness, a  year and a half of fainting everyday, my almost being put on a transplant list (heart and liver together!) and countless doctor appointments and other close calls. I followed him after becoming stable (yes, it's possible after all that) across the US to move to his home city where he began pre-MS testing for his own symptoms. Even after his family began to realize that we had nothing in common and became abusive he and I stuck together. We're that couple that make others annoyed because we still seem like we're in our first year of marriage... 

I do this practice so that I can be strong physically, mentally and emotionally for the two of us. I'm proud to have overcome all these odds to spend my time with people that care about me without even having met me. (That's YOU!) And for the old and new friends I've made that treat me like family. Life is too short to feel disrespected and unloved.

1041.0,"Hoohoo. Gotta say this video was an earlier bird than i am. Felt quite loved yesterday at my sister's birthday party when my parents gave all four of us kisses on the forehead, reminding us that we, indeed, are special to them, as special as to show us indefinite love each and everyday. Of course, that aside, i've got another lover that only i happen to know of and that is my own self(subconscious and super conscious mind) that i know would return the love i give to it today back to me in the most ffabulous loving way there is. Let us all take a breath in through this practice, of mutual love, joy, and excitement so that our body and mind will thank us for it in the long run. Keep the love going, along with the juices to flow. Y'all marvelous and remember to love yourselves. Peace",Ugw-klO76OZnqivOXbF4AaABAg,0.0,10.0,2019-01-19T05:17:59Z,0.9996252059936523
