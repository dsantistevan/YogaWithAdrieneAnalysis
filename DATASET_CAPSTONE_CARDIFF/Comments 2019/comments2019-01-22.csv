188.0,"writing you and the community from Colorado on a tough day to say, especially the part when you say ""we honor the darkness also"" was so important.
I did my dedicate practice today as one type of self-care that helps me get back on normal routines after a credible threat had a huge number of CO schools shut down for safety...okay...right? so back to the Light i went.
the right practice on the right day always happens. the poses were challenging and invigorating to get my mind on my body and what i CAN help to control, my breath and my movement...and i was struggling struggling struggling to feel or find the light when my memories keep tracking back to where I was 20 years ago in Colorado schools...or where I was this morning when saying goodbye to my Colorado school student (daughter in 2nd grade.)...and then there you were, to tell me, we honor the darkness too. my hands touched my heart and I was there in the practice again.

242.0,"My second time through Dedicate.  In the midst of this ""Light"" practice, what suddenly surfaced was an awareness of my fear of ""my light.""  It was crystal clear:  that I knew who I was in my deepest being; it was time to let go of the fear of allowing that ""me"" to be fully visible -- to lead my external life.  That awareness also illuminated how I had allowed myself to stay trapped or confined in situations that fueled that fear. . . . 

; 
Trusting the process (not only of yoga but of the fullness of our faith) that when we are ready to ""see,"" it will be revealed.  I have dedicated both of my ""Dedicate"" journeys to ""openness to true love.""  Not seeking ""someone"" but rather to be able to live more deeply into the last lines of a song that came to me once about my life:  ""When my body returns to the earth, my breath returns to the wind;  I will have offered what is mine to offer; I will have loved with all I am.""

But when you take a moment to realize that without darkness/ bad feelings, you wouldn't quite appreciate the light as much when it does come around. And darkness can help you understand when something isn't right and perhaps you somehow need a change, whether it be mindset and/or circumstance, it could be a signal that you need help and need to reach out.

464.0,"Yesterday when I practice ""light"" for the first time i didn't connect to it at all. It was one of those days where I am just waiting for instructions, I'm not in the moment nor do I feel an inspiration to make the practice more ""my own"". So I decided to try it again today and... It worked! It was a very satisfying practice, notwithstanding the fact that my inner thighs muscles are the tightest of a pretty tight body. But still, I made changes where I felt I wanted or needed them, and overall the journey was really nice. This makes me realize that we are really ""the captains of our fates, the masters of our souls"". Our attitude makes a huge difference. And I don't say that as a way of ""shaming"" someone. Days when you don't feel it are normal. Embrace your humanity, and just know that you have the possibility and the ability to be a light... Tomorrow or in ten days or one year, it doesn't matter how long it takes, you have this superpower.

589.0,"Today I was pretty down before starting this Day 21 practice. I was depressed and had wished I had ended my life previously. I get like this from time to time. I know it passes. I had meditated for an hour right before, but feeling low energy, I had fallen asleep. This practice did transform my energy and mood. It was really just shaking it off and getting moving. Once I tried attempting those poses on the ground with my knee bent, I was meeting my edge and had to do a one legged froggy to release the tension in my knee. This took my mind off my day thus far and I get off feeling lighter and brighter. It is mid day, but better late than never.",Ugy2UeGKsbkEtD9mURN4AaABAg,6.0,42.0,2019-01-22T21:58:58Z,-0.9295332431793213

You are an Amazing Teacher.
I have a Beautiful Daughter, mother of Twin 13 month old boys, Special Ed Teacher with MS since she was 19 years old.
Never complains. She is 31 and The Best Mother, Teacher, Daughter I believe in the World!
She moved to NC and I live in Massachusetts. I miss her each day but she video calls me almost every day and I get to see her and my Beautiful GrandSons and wonderful Son in law.

Thank you Adriene for being an Amazing Teacher never judging but Always Encouraging as my Beautiful Daughter.

And at the end his brother (who comes purring every time I'm doing yoga and just lies on top of me) joined us. It was so sweet and a reminder not to get frustrated so much.

782.0,I woke up this morning after another rough night sleep and pain in the body. Anyone with chronic pain can relate to how mentally and emotionally it can be in the wee hours of the morning after not sleeping.   There is so much solace knowing that this 40 day journey is waiting for me.  It is the first thing I do even if it is 3:30 AM.  My question for myself today:  How can I shine my light so brightly with the world (regardless of how my body temple is feeling).  Yoga teaches me that is not about waiting for the someday in the future.  I show up NOW with whatever is appearing over and over and over.  I loved the opening pose as I could really feel into the fluidity of the pose and the pose at the end-Pure comfort.  My I all beings experience fluidity and comfort this day.,UgzjkhlRCoB2ZXJAtER4AaABAg,2.0,3.0,2019-01-22T10:50:46Z,0.9987377524375916
