Then, another, and another, etc. I've done a yoga with Adriene 30 day challenge every month this year, and I am SO much stronger, happier, and more peaceful than I was before.

Even without sleep, without proper me-time, with a baby on the mat, I breathed love in and love out. However, my wrists started to hurt real bad, so before today’s practice I watched and practiced the Yoga for wrist pain. Imagine my surprise when this video zoomed in on the wrists as well!

What I realised, however, is that my shoulders always come up and I have to actively bring them down again. My neck also tenses and it's hard to keep it long. 
Do you have any advice on how to keep an upright posture without also collapsing down again? It was better and there weere days when I didn't have to actively pull myself up but I automatically kept an upright posture and when I collapsed I automatically raised my crown of the head and the rest of my body.",Ugzan7OMyr8aATH3iat4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-08-08T22:18:46Z,-0.6935497522354126

I get mixed emotions for the past 5 days during the sessions...mostly sadness and crying but you kept me going.
But today I actually felt playful and giggly! and I was laughing at myself at times! and when we placed a hand on our stomach...i actually felt apologetic to my stomach. I was thanking it for everything its done for me..and told it I've been ungrateful or ashamed of its shape or form but Today I apologize to it for shaming it. I love you body...we have been through it all together and you know me the best :) From now on I will love you because I'm already doing the best I can for you...and you are so good to me always...We are a perfect match :D 
Lets celebrate our strengths, weaknesses, diversity...let's celebrate ourselves.
Thank you Adrienne for the party! Yoga so far has been a celebration of the body...acceptance...shedding of fear and shame!
Lots of love to you from London!",UgwUoeso03kBWPMa1V94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-22T12:30:14Z,0.999477207660675

Thank you so much <3 I can definitely see myself coming back to this one after the 30 days - or even in between, if i'm feeling like my core needs an extra loving boost. 
I had to take a rest day yesterday because the day before was ultra challenging and on top of Yoga I also did my weekly swimming as cardio - my muscles were on fire like never before because of that! I realized that to truly build strength I had to give my body a day to recover. I really missed doing this in the morning - it threw my entire day off kilter. Thanks so much for being a such an important part of my mornings now. I feel so anchored and motivated throughout the rest of the day if I start it off with one of your videos.

I quit the gym and started to do yoga by myself at home. But it got horribly boring and difficult to challenge myself. And I was lucky to find Yoga with Adriene! Today it was the first day I really felt challenged, but I learned a great lesson: keep your belly button close to your spine, keep your lower back close to the floor. This was such an amazing piece of knowledge. Adrienne, you inspire me to feel gratitude for the things that sometimes I took for granted. Now, I am always always grateful for being able to move my body, , my wonderful belly that carried three kids and could do the core yoga today, my wonderful boobs that nourished three babies, my whole wonderful body that enjoys yoga with wonderful Adrienne every morning.

And I have carpal tunnel syndrome, thanks to over doing it with handstands a couple of years ago, I was 50 at the time and it's really messed with my practice and I now find it difficult to stay in downward facing dog for more than 3 breaths or any wrist weight bearing postures. I like your instruction to 'claw the mat' which I've been mindfully doing all week, the great news is I haven't woken up once from tingling hands this week and my wrists actually seem to be managing okay.

483.0,"When I first did day 6, I was crying from anger. I was soooo mad, I was swearing and hating you ""how do you think it is possible?"" and the only thing that made me through the day's practice was the thing, that I felt, I love you Adriene, and I trust you so much, that I could hold to this trust, that it's good to do this, if you tell me so. The only thing that led me through my hate and anger was love and trust. And you know, though it may sound strange, it is how love works. It holds all the paradoxes in an embrace of acceptence. So after the first time, I wrote it into my diary, to repeat it 2 weeks later. And this is my second time, I'm here.  14 days later (doing everyday the yoga), it's still hard, but no anger and much much more strength. The only time, when tears were coming, when I released from one hard posture. It was tears from relief and gratitude for the ground to hold me. Quite a change, hm?!

562.0,"Day 6 on the books! When I saw it was core today, I was excited and fearful because my stomach area is so weak and sticks out. I couldn't do all the positions exactly, but continued and tried to keep up the best I could. The other challenge I experienced today was laying on my back, it feels stiff and sore and like I could not get flat, kinda like its full of inflammation or kinda like I have fat pockets back there and when I lay flat it squishes and I can't get flat. I continued with the lesson and the breathing helped me release and the rubbing of my stomach also helped. It was like I was releasing old ideas, thoughts, and build up of the stress out of my body and praising myself of what I was able to accomplish today.  I am 52, long time smoker, quit now 2 mos.and haven't exercised in a few years, plus I've never done yoga before (My old idea about yoga is its too hard and I am not flexible enough, I am too out of shape to do it) these last 6 sessions have changed my thinking into Yes I can do this and so happy I found Adriene to teach me. I finished feeling confident and praising my body thanking it for staying strong for me when I haven't treated it with care in so long; ready to do more strengthing each day I practice my yoga. I feel as though the dedicate 30 days is building upon each day of strength and confidence. I've never felt so good and want to keep working on strengthing my body until I found yoga with Adriene.",UgwFJp2Bpm808qDvnod4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2019-02-06T19:23:53Z,0.9937500357627869

When I do core work my shoulders ( on the back side kind of close to the neck) of tension and pain. I would like to know what can we do for upper body tension and pain in the back. Also, I feel my right big toe and ankle with lots of pain and tension because I injured 2 years ago trying to do a handstand and I lost the balance and came back strait into my right big toe. Since then my flexibility in the right feet and ankle are 70% less. I have been doing physical therapy but nothing helps me to be able, for instance, sit on my feet while I have the toes engage in the floor as you do in this Day 6. Any ideas?

I love how she’s slowly helping us beginning yogis get a strong foundation before tackling any of the more intense poses. I’m so excited to complete the 30 days of yoga! Today’s core focus was rough but her comments really motivate and I actually got through the entire video, which is so shocking to me because I have a weak core. I feel stronger everyday. I’d definitely recommend beginning yogis to do the 30 days of yoga with Adriene, I’m going to be sad when the 30 days is over!.",Ugxl6DotcRjnkPwtv714AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-28T01:34:10Z,0.9967893958091736

I made it through the first core day within my own edge but found at the end when I turned to the right ..laying on my side my right eye just started tearing and then I was crying for really no known reason..?? any suggestions as to why this may have happened...not sure if it was tears of pride of making it through my most challenging part of core (in bad shape)..or just unlocked overwhelming feelings..IDK  has this happened to anyone.

I don't know if that infection that went through all of my body was the result of stress or some internal resistance as I never get sick. Either way, this lesson was a butt kicker. I'm trying to do at least two more tonight to catch up.

I quit on pretty much all of the sets of pulses, and I suspect I wasn't supporting myself properly for the poses. So we got one good diagnosis out of this: my core is in dire need of some attention and training. It's nice to discover these weaknesses about yourself with a comprehensive program like this where every muscle of your body is engaged, but not in isolation.",Ugx3Z-F5GLsuUERFsE54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-13T02:20:49Z,-0.9985873699188232

I finished today’s session feeling really proud of myself because when I didn’t feel like i really nailed some parts, I rewinded and tried again. 

It felt so good to take a moment and thank my body, (especially my belly) in this practice. We always tend to aestheticise our love for our body, which i suppose is fair because we all deserve to feel an appreciation for our bodies’ own beauty. But our bodies are so much more than beautiful! They do so much for us. Thank you for reminded me of that. One of my resolutions for the new year was to appreciate my body daily for the things it does for me, and to learn to tend to it like a garden.

Whenever I tried to train my core, I felt all weak because I couldn't keep up with the speed or couldn't do certain exercises but today was different. Even though I still couldn't do all exercises due to horrible pain in the neck when I lift my head, instead of feeling my muscles working, I didn't beat myself up for it but instead was proud of had my core has done up to that point! I felt really happy with my stomach for being as strong as it was right now, a feeling I had never really had before.

904.0,"I wasn't going to comment at first but maybe someone else will see this and feel better because of it.
I couldn't get through most of this video without crying. I found it incredibly hard. I've been doing yoga pretty regularly for about 3 years now and despite Adriene's loving words, I'm still terrified of Day 6 and of core. I usually skip these videos altogether or don't even get halfway because I give up on myself.
Now I never cry on the mat. But halfway through there I was, crying because I couldn't do it and I didn't feel strong enough or brave enough etc. But I did it anyway. I had my moment, I kept the video going and I tried to pick back up where I could for as much as I could. And that's okay. And when I got to the end of the video I went and cried some more.
I realised then that I wasn't crying because I couldn't do it, I was crying because I made myself feel so worthless and bad about it. For too long, my first instinct has been to hate myself, to feel less than other people, than myself. So here's me not shying away from that and saying it's okay to feel bad and like you're doing it wrong. You're not. It's just part of figuring out how to love yourself.
So here's to you, and me, loving ourselves throughout. Namaste.",UgxtGS-AFZq3elV5CjZ4AaABAg,47.0,1084.0,2019-01-10T19:41:12Z,-0.9915313720703125

Learning that our core muscles do so much (just ask any athlete or anyone who has pulled a core muscle) and our stomach and entire digestive system does a hell of a lot more than we give it credit for.

1005.0,"I'm gonna get a little real and a little long here. 
Today was hard. Physically and mentally. I've never felt my core was strong, I've never really trusted my core or the muscles there despite knowing logically how much of my strength comes from there.
I struggled with this practice. I struggled with day 6 last year but this year I knew what was coming and I thought I was mentally and physically prepared because I'm stronger and more capable than I was this time last year. I was not. Never in any practice have I been so stuck between ""I can but I can't"". I was okay for the hovers and the three-legged dogs because I felt like I could trust my legs and my arms to support what my core couldn't, I had a safety net. Then I got onto my back and started working. I've never felt so weak during my practice. Not last year when I was new or in any other workout I've done in my life. Laying there trying to hold my legs and my shoulders up and knowing logically that I can do this, that I've done it before, that there's no pressure to look good or get it perfect, and that I could take breaks if I needed to, but feeling like I was fighting with myself to get there and that feeling of weakness through my core, through my very centre, in comparison to the rest of my body was so in conflict with my logical mind that I felt like I was going to shake apart. 
I'm not gonna lie. I burst into tears. Free flowing, lying on my back in the middle of the floor sobbing because the conflict in me felt like it was gonna break me. Stuck between ""I can but I can't"".
Well I can, I did. I took my break. I cried, I let myself rest. Gave myself a hot minute of feeling like crap, dried my tears and then I rewound to where I fell and I started again. And I did it. I finished the practice, I did the last little obliques work, I reached towards the end of my mat, I put in that extra work to prove that I cam capable of getting back up after falling. 
I want to say 'thank you', Adriene. Truly. From the bottom of my heart. Thank you for doing these videos. Thank you for being patient and kind and caring. For making me and others feel like it's okay to fall and that everything is just practice and that we are perfectly imperfect and capable. Thank you for being there and teaching us and guiding us into taking care of all parts of ourselves. 
You probably won't see this, and it's super long so I won't be disappointed if you don't read it but I wanted to tell you and anyone else who reads this what this practice was for me. That sometimes these practices are hard not just on your body but on your mind as well, but that we are all capable of getting back up after falling down.
Thank you.
Namaste

1085.0,"When I first began doing yoga I thought my wrists were weak. I had trouble holding down dog for long at all, as my wrists would hurt, especially as down dog would be repeated through a session. I didn't even have any thoughts that it might be that my wrists could get stronger. I really thought they were just weak and I was bummed because I didn't think I'd ever be able to fully do yoga with ease in terms of any asanas using wrist action. But, to my happy surprise, one day I noticed my wrists no longer hurt or were sore and I could do down dog for however long and however many times it would be repeated in a session. I would push my wrists to hold a pose longer than it felt safe to back in those earlier days of yoga, but just holding the poses however long felt safe did lead to my wrists getting very strong and now they are not an issue.

1150.0,"Every year for the past four years, I've started the year doing this 30 day yoga challenge. The first year, I'd lost a fiance who was living 5,000 miles overseas. The second year, I'd started seeing someone new and dove into it quickly. The third year, we'd just moved in together, I was recovering from a broken my arm, and our relationship was falling apart. Year four, I'm crying every day doing this damn yoga because I finally found the strength to move out and begin moving on. From all of it.

These 30 day beginning-of-the-year resets are always reminding me that life has ups (like my dope chaturanga dandasana) and downs (like that awful hovering-three-legged-posed! wtf!), and that in the midst of one I can remember the other to find balance. I cried in each of the last three videos because you're always reminding me how to find love in myself and for the fourth year in a row when I needed to be guided there most. When I'm too depressed (and poor) to make it to the yoga studio and be social with hundreds of Whole Foods yogi types, these videos give me a means to care for my body, my soul, and my self. I can't thank you enough for these videos, Adriene (and YWA team). They make me laugh, they make me cry, and they make me wake up looking forward to something every day.

So now, whenever I am doing any type of exercise connected to it, I like to imagine myself get stronger for that type of moment. Last part definitely felt like it.

1161.0,"I am so grateful for this challenge and for myself for 'dedicating' my time and energy to be here. a couple days ago someone left a comment about how yoga has helped their PTSD. I am so thankful for that comment. Today my husband and I were in a car crash. we are bruised and sore and possible bruised or broken ribs. Throughout this experience I breathed. I just breathed. That comment came to my mind and helped me feel more at ease. I also remembered and felt the support from everyone here in this yoga community and knew I was supported and cared about. I couldn't wait to get home to experience today's yoga journey. You are all friends I haven't met yet. I have always loved and remember when Adriene says 'lots of love in, and lots of love out'. People always tell you too imagine good things in and bad things out but I never connected with it. One of the first yoga videos I did of Adriene's she said lots of love and lots of love out and it rung true to my soul and has been with me since. I am a being of love who accepts love and shares love. And every day I find new meaning in those words. Thank you Adriene. Thank you friends.

Today's practice was awesome, and it’s so much fun to be doing it “while its still hot!” :)
You’d be proud of me Adriene, and hopefully of yourself too, since we both achieved something we've wanted. Last month when I had a tumble and hurt my wrists, I couldn’t do day 6 of Revolution with you. So instead, I did my own practice. 40 minutes of what felt good.
I prefer to practice with you, of course. Cause you’re funny, wise, and a good friend and teacher. But I don’t ‘need’ to. I could, after 3 months of practice with you, do it on my own. Congratulations to us both!

Adriene and yoga family: my manduka mat has gotten really slippery and I find that I want to use my old mat because my wrists are hurting (they are sliding in downward dog) ...Should I salt it again?

1583.0,"Great workout. Two questions:
•for the exercises in which our legs are suspended above us, I tend to feel it more in the groin and top of my thighs instead of my lower abs; am I doing something wrong?

•when it came time to straighten the legs above me and then crunch, I got a *huge* cramp in my upper abs and had to make the crunch motion a lot smaller so it wouldn’t happen again; is this acceptable (at least until I can work up to doing a bigger crunch)?

My danse teacher always tells me that I should work on my core but I don't XD Today's practice has been hard.

When adriene said ''trust'' in the video I broke out in tears. Trusting for me has been a difficult thing since long but here on the mat I feel safe to do so. and then when we went into the V shape I found how strong body had become since last time I did this position. I didnt even shake! and then I broke out in tears even more. Thank you, I didnt know I would feel so successful with todays video but I do. So Thank You <3

The rest of the core exercise was challenging and rewarding. I realize I need to work on drawing in my navel to my spine. Adriene, your core practices have really changed how I use to do core exercises. It was such a slog in the past. Now it is a loving practice in which I am focused on the present.

I'm learning how to apply this to my time off the mat and it's full of hits and misses and it's harder to not blame yourself when you feel you should already know better... but I'm not letting that discourage me :D",UgzTReDJfb3DqoVMlnh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-07T16:13:04Z,0.999453604221344

1778.0,"I love how vulnerable and loving this practice allows me to be. Today my mantra was 'My body loves me' and when we were doing more intense core work or rubbing our bellies it turned to 'My stomach loves me' and I felt myself keep replying 'and I love my body/my stomach'. Somehow this allowed me do the WHOLE practice (which I had been dreading). Everytime I breathed in love and breathed out love, I was so aware of the positivity and love of our community. Tears of happiness as we bowed namaste to one another.    I'm a sap, but I'm a happy sap 🌳😂. Namaste ❤",Ugx51MKx3VuNXSe_X514AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-07T16:11:42Z,0.9994506239891052

So far it's been amazing. You make me feel empowered, relaxed, and thankful all in one go. When I'm having a hard time on the mat you help me to stay relaxed, breathe, and to laugh a little with your jokes (they're very helpful btw). I'm excited to continue this journey with you until January 31st. At the end of this dedicate I've decided to dedicate myself to staying with the yoga practice throughout this year of 2019 and beyond and see where it takes me. I just wanted to say a quick thank you for what you do and that you're deeply appreciated. Namaste 🙏 also quick sidenote...what is the music that you use for the intro and the ending of these videos.

Then I decided to try this practice with a kind beginners mind. So to just see what my (feverish) body could do and see what was too much. And I was quite surprised. I took an extra happy baby in the first round of back core work. And stayed down at the end when you suggested. But all the other things went quite well. This is such a big achievement for me, to just do what IS possible instead of focus on what's not. Usually I would just skip yoga on a sick day, but I do feel like I conquered something.

1833.0,"Relight My Fire - Take That :D
I often struggle with core work because it puts strain on my lower back. Whenever I lift up I feel it more in my lower back than in my abdominals. I thought this was because I had a weak lower back, but was told it's the whole lower trunk that needs strengthening. The corset. Is this true? Will my lower back get stronger the more I work on my core? It did feel better to focus on the zipping/kissing of the upper and lower abdominals. I also sometimes get a tight chest. I think this is from trying to follow along with you Adriene as best I can with the breath. It doesn't always seem natural to me though to breathe when you do, so it's something I need to work on I think.

I don't have any problems with my wrists, but when I'm in table top position, I start to feel it in my shoulder musles after a while, they start to burn. Is this also normal or is my posture off? I'm pretty sure it's normal, I have very weak arm muscles and I feel they're getting stronger.

2129.0,"Today was the first time I woke up and felt some apprehension rather than excitement to come on the mat. I had to work very late to finish a project, I'll have to work very late again today because of an exam tomorrow morning, and I thought ""my core is so weak, this is going to be hell, is it really the right choice to do this today instead of getting an extra 30 minutes to sleep or work""? But then I realized two things: 1) I was scared of ""failing"" at yoga.Which is ridiculous, because you can't ""fail"" or ""do badly"" at a practice, you can only get stronger and feel better. And anyway, this is Adriene! I trust her, and I trust the process. 2) Yes, showing up at my mat just for me, even when it isn't easy is the right choice. It is self-care and we need some more than ever when we feel tired, stressed and overwhelmed. So I did it, I got on the mat, and I actually enjoyed myself a whole lot! I even let out a surprise laugh at the one-knee hover because of how different it felt from both 3-legged dog and the normal hovering on both knees. I am so happy and energised right now! So anyway, this extra long comment just to say: to anyone feeling like I was today: let go of that fear, that frustration. Trust the process and go in your practice being kind to yourself, without judgement. It will be amazing.

I’ve been eating the wrong things and have been wanting to stop but finding it difficult, connecting with my tummy today is a game changer, I felt a shift, I felt how much I love myself and how much pain & unhappiness my tummy was feeling from the wrong food.

2201.0,Day 6 done. Core's on fire and can't seem to love this any more than I already do. Way to get them six packs everyone. Golden tradition on point to shred some fat in the middle of softness and self-love; this is what building strength slowly should be like. Stay strong everybody. Your body will thank you for it in time. Thanks for the magical fat shredding practice/workout. peace.,Ugwm5MKzFjy1G0Re8bV4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-01-07T06:42:29Z,0.9992713332176208
