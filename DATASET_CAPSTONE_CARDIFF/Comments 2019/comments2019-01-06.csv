75.0,"Hello, everyone. I've been a fan of Adriene's since earlier last year. I just recently received my YTT-200 certification and am deepening my home practice. Now to my point: I have only gotten emotional during my practices twice in the whole two years I've been doing Yoga. Once was because I had a bad day and the other was because I just wasn't mentally present. Today, with this practice. Oh my. When we rocked back to Sukhasana and completed the cool down, my body just knew to put my hands on my knees in surrender. In Anjali Mudra, I immediately teared up but in Namaste, the tears were flowing every which way.  I struggle with letting my body lead, my mind always has the front seat. Today, some switch was flipped and it just felt really good to know that what I did, before you instructed it, was correct and that it felt amazing.

I‚Äôm 32 years old and I feel like a wreck, health-wise. All I know is that after doing 3 or 4 of her videos, I decided to stop my strenuous workout (30 mins cardio reaching a heart rate of 165bpm + 1 hr strength exercises, 5 days a week) and I decided to do dedicate. I‚Äôm only on day 5, but I feel better. I‚Äôll start watching my diet next week. I have been eating pretty much anything lately. I hope I‚Äôll feel much better once I eat clean and continue doing dedicate. Adriene, please continue doing these free videos. You‚Äôre changing lives for the better. And to everyone else who are thinking of doing this or saying to themselves, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do this, just not now yet‚Äù, a piece of unsolicited advise - making the decision to wear something comfy and hopping on your mats, might just be the best decision you‚Äôll do for your health. Don‚Äôt wait. Just do it! And feel the difference even on day 1. As early as day 1, I was reminded that mindful breathing brings about healing.

I have always been drawn in a weird way to yoga, but never felt like I found a comfortable teacher or class, as the atmosphere for me is very important. You create that awesome, calming, nature-like feeling in every video, you have such a calm and sweet voice, and I can set my room and concentrate only on my improvement and not think about anything else. I do most of the video with my eyes closed, as this seems to be what my body wants. You are so great and we appreciate you so much! You do absolute wonders for my power to meditate and visualise, and I absolutely felt the need to thank you! I wish you all the good and health in the world!

554.0,"Hi Adriene! I've just found your classes and am really, really loving them - thank you. I'd not done yoga in about 5 years so am really starting as a total novice. I have a question - I""m finding that when doing downward dog and any of the poses which put weight on the wrists, the outside of the palm of one of my hands gets incredibly painful, as if something is being sprained. The pain is only on the outside part of the palm though. 


Would you have any idea what this might be and what I could do to help it? I've tried switching up where I put the most weight, and putting more weight on my fingertips, but it doesn't seem to help.

Thank you again so much for these classes!

However, my french bulldog puppy kept coming in and giving me kisses during downward dog, and as much as I love puppy kisses, I kept losing focus and became really frustrated.  I handed my frenchie a greenie treat, hopped back on the mat, refocused, and I was amazed at how fast I can fall back into it!  I used to never be able to do that, I'd have to meditate for a few minutes to get back in the 'flow' of things.

Started February 2nd, and plan on making it through the 30 days even if I have to take a break once in awhile. I also deal with migraines and a back issue (it's complicated), so I might have to actually slow the speed of your videos down. I just want to focus on moving slowly but with purpose and save myself from hurting my back. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for doing these videos for people like me.

757.0,"So I teach exercise classes (up to 4 hours a day) and lift weights. Everyone considers me 'the fitness lady' but my body is telling me otherwise. I started this dedicate journey bc my nerves down the right side of my back have become compressed, and my left shoulder constantly aches. So I've stopped going to the gym, and after day 4 I noticed my back has aligned really well and my shoulder has started to feel less painful (breathing into the pain, rather than being frustrated with it is helping). I'm now considering getting rid of my gym membership, swapping to martial arts & just doing yoga with Adriene! I think what I'm learning is that the premise of weightlifting is just unsustainable- keep tearing your muscles, keep adding the weights even when your body is telling you otherwise, keep pushing yourself. When really we need to listen to our bodies & should feel energised after exercise. What's the point of lifting really heavy if you feel completely burnt out after and need to supplement to get through it? Doesn't sound like health to me.",Ugy1pINjBMK2m69gqOp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-27T12:53:53Z,-0.9955301880836487

839.0,"This yoga practice has helped me so incredibly much. I feel warmed, relieved, calm, and ready to go most days. 

I loved what you said about ""It all begins with the breath, followed by the foundation..."" As a singer, this concept resonates with me so strongly and couldn't have been a more perfect mantra to start my day (currently prepping for a big concert this evening :) ). Sound, movement, motivation, all starts with the breath and the inhale. Then you rely on your foundation and support to move through your journey. Whether it's for work, just to get through your day (or in my case: to get through that passage in the Donizetti piece that has had me worked up this whole week) trust in the breath and your foundation. Your body WILL support you through your practice :). 

Thank you for your words of wisdom, Adriene

Much love, and namaste

It may come as a shock, but actually the hardest pose is towards the beginning for me, where we are just pausing in an arms-up position while sitting down. Most yoga practices that I've done only stay in those poses for approximately one breath and then you move on to the next pose, so you get distracted with the movement and forget your discomfort. I really like getting a chance to explore more of the minute spaces where I might be tight and then getting to loosen them, no matter how obscure they may be.

899.0,5 months after a lumpectomy and removal of 18 lymph nodes under my left arm I am finally able to do down dog! It is still challenging and on the last down dog of this practice I started to shake but I held strong and then the tears started to flow.

I get a biopsy on Friday and the thought of having a recurrence so soon and going through surgery again after getting to a place of healing just overwhelmed me with emotion.

1030.0,"So I'm 4 days behind (just started late and I'm ok with that), and just finished this one and I really struggled. The first four had me feeling really confident and like ok I can do this. And then half way in this one I was like omg wait what?? My wrists were aching and I felt a bit deflated at the end. Not my usual extra energy feel.
So I came here to read comments which is almost never the right choice. But it was! 
Thank you to everyone here giving so much love and support and saying how it was hard for you too but you're proud you showed up. Because it reminded me to be proud I showed up. And to not be scared of what's coming or that I won't be able to keep up. That there is support here. And I just have to do what's right for me and my body.

Yeah I'm still really scared the curve will keep getting steeper and I'll feel farther and farther behind. But I know if I just keep showing up, adrian will be there for me, as will all of y'all.

1410.0,"Today I really had a moment of realizing how far I have come in my yoga practice. I was sitting in the very beginning, and realized that I am using yoga as a tool to calm myself, a way to feel strong and always a way to try and accept myself without needing to constantly judge. The first year I tried this, 2016, I tried to muscle through, and when I missed a day I would make it up the next day, and do two or three videos trying to ""catch up"". I learned over time, though, that while completing the videos is important, it is more important to encourage myself. So instead of beating myself down, each day, after I complete a practice, I tell myseld, ""Good job! You've done 5 days so far! Way to go!""

Looking for some advice tho - I broke my elbow 1.5yrs ago and ever since, downward dog has just been difficult for me. I cant straighten that arm, nor can I rotate my arm bicep forwards. It puts a lot of pressure through my shoulders and is not the comfy pose it used to be. Ive tried shifting weight more on feet, adjusting my hands but can't seem to find a happy position! I'm gonna stick at it in the hope I'll get stronger but if anyone has advice or experienced similar issues I'd love to hear from you!

Thanks for another great sess Adriene. Day 6 is my fave, can't wait till tomorrow! Namaste x

Adrienne, I love your videos because you don‚Äôt just do yoga of the body, which is what most westerners seem to believe is all that yoga is. You also do yoga of the mind, which is the roots, and the foundation of the practice. Namaste. üôèüèø üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",Ugzjx-Ck2HbsbU15sQZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-06T17:03:28Z,0.9987955093383789

I really love yoga and Adriene especially and notice the benefits when I am running. I am recovering from a hellish cartilage repair and yesterday managed an hour of running for the first time in 2 years.
