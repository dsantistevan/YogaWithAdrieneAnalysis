I also have ptsd and this has helped me to relax and concentrate on what's important to me.  I have always put others first and never took time for myself even though everyone has told me to. I have found that the time that i have spent doing yoga had helped a lot in many ways. I go to the Hindu temple and a lot of times my back would get to hurting so i would have to stop and try to refocus because of the pain in my lower back but now i can stay without any distractions.

I used to practice yoga through videos that weren't at my speed and didn't give me lots of alignment checks and i ended up injuring myself more so than anything. Your classes have been so amazing at building my foundation of yoga ""from the ground up""! It truly makes a huge difference. I came to yoga through a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and deep depressions and unmanageable moods - yogic teachings have been a deep gift to my being. I realize we are all one and there was no seperation to begin with. With that realization, the depression falls away (for the most part LOL like yoga teaches us too, everything rises and falls....and rises and falls :P) and I realize we're all just doing our best. Funny how it just looks like some physical postures but you truly end up finding your inner light in all of that quiet. Thank you from my soul to yours. Almost done 30 days of yoga! I've never done that in my LIFE - I used to wonder if I'd bother to take care of myself enough that day to do a yoga practice, and now, I wake up wanting it to be the FIRST thing I do.

400.0,"What a beautiful practice with an unexpected gift.  I have always had an ambivalent relationship with power, including my own personal, internal power (one of the effects of trauma).  As I've journeyed through these 30 days of ""dedicate,"" I arrived on the mat today and found myself immediately releasing my resistance to my own power.  Lo and behold, the gift:  I flowed through this practice with ease, grace and gentleness!  Not to be confused with ""perfection of form"" (whatever that might mean).  But rather, in somehow finally fully opening to and allowing my power, I also touched grace and gentleness.  They were/are interconnected.  . . .  The embodied experience --after many years of patience, perseverance, trust and determined healing work with bucketfuls of grief and tears--of a line in a song that came to/through me one day, ""There's a strong yet gentle woman waiting to be born if I can find a way to make it through this last long night.""        . . . . Trusting the process; being dedicated; believing in the transformative power of love, and, one day, we experience in our body in a way that words cannot do justice that the armor of being a ""survivor"" has shattered and fallen away and we have found our deeper self who was there waiting for us:  for me, the strong yet gentle woman and the deepest feeling of peace I have yet experienced.

508.0,Standing splits are something I'm still working on. I can do the splits on the floor at least on one side properly and on the other side more or less. But whenever I'm attempting standing splits or any other position with one leg lifted to the back like Warrior III. My hip starts to cramp on the side of the foot that's on the floor. So I wasn't able to hold it for that long but just did a forward fold while waiting and realized that I can now kiss my knees easily in forward fold without having to pull myself closer.

553.0,"Hey Adriene,
First of all: thank you SO much for your super duper series Dedicate. I‚Äôve dedicated myself and have followed it for 27 days straigt now. I intend to continue with the Care program in February!
Could you go into (or point out where to find information about) flexibility problems? I know: we should trust the path ‚Ä¶¬†but I‚Äôm really eager to get some indication as to how long it will take for me to be able to really do a downward facing dog. I must admit that my flexibility has improved somewhat, but I‚Äôm really still far from being able to do a downward facing dog; sit up straight with my legs stretched; touch the ground with my hands while standing up; or sticking my stretched legs vertically into the air while on my back. Moreover it seems to me to be much harder on my belly muscles and my neck to hold my legs up in a 45-60 degrees angle (which is what I manage) than in a 90 degree angle.
So any encouragement, extra exercises or information about the problem would be really welcome!

It was not knee pain or hips pain, it was just the muscle, and it's the first time I ever felt this pain. And I used to do some ""bodybuilding"" for a year, so I know the pain in my thigh. I just couldn't do it... :'( I feel like I lost every effort I did since the beginning of this challenge and right know, I don't know if you will finish it :( I feel like complete shit.
