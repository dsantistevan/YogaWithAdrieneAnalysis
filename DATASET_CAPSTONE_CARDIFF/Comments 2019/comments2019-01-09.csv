0.0,"Hello everyone!  One week in the books! 

Often when we are met with challenges or when we feel stuck, we feel like we have to work harder, push harder, so today is a beautiful reminder to relax, lean in, and find a softness and an ease.

Enjoy this moving meditation. An opportunity to get un-stuck. Lean in and get your sway on.",UgwQ134lmOBYIrlYR9N4AaABAg,39.0,500.0,2019-01-09T14:05:54Z,0.9997684359550476

2.0,"Today is a painful day for me. I am practicing this one day after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. I have a lot of fear and anxiety about how things could change, about how the world could change, about losing my family and safety and security. The anxiety I am feeling has manifested in my body as physical pain as it often does, and I deeply appreciated the gentle swaying in the beginning portion and used it to stretch out the parts of my body that are feeling tense with gentleness. This practice was a great opportunity to be present with all that I am feeling with tenderness and love for myself and for all those who are suffering.

7.0,"I broke a toe last week, so it's just gentle and relaxing practices for now. Before yoga, I was an avid swimmer and runner - I broke my foot a few years back, and felt really frustrated that I couldn't ""do anything"" (not to mention the already difficult relationship I had with my body being further exacerbated by the worries of my muscles atrophying and gaining weight).

76.0,"...........  Fibroid Treatment ........... As a sign of gratitude to Dr. Taiwa Abu for how he completely cured my wife from fibroid, I decided to reach out to those still suffering from this Disease.  My wife suffered from fibroid for more than 6 year of marriage after our first son and it was really tough and heartbreaking for me because she was my all and the symptoms were terrible, she had irregular and painful menstrual flow and the size of it was 6cm, and she always complain of stomach pain. We tried various therapies prescribed by our neurologist but none could cure her. I searched for a cure and I saw a testimony by a woman from the UK who was cured and so many others with similar body problems, and she left the whatsapp number.. +2349047218377   of the doctor who had the natural cure for fibroid. I never imagined fibroid has a natural cure if not surgery not until i contacted him and he assured me my wife will be fine. I got the herbal medication he recommended and my wife used it as instructed by  Dr.Taiwo , and,after 4 weeks we went to the hospital for a scan and the doctor confirmed that there is no trace of fibroid and now she is fully okay, even up till this moment she is so full of life. fibroid has a cure and it is a herbal cure contact  doctor,  Dr. Taiwo Abu for more information about this natural treatment.......

I have battled plantar fasciitis in my left foot for over 3 years, constantly trying to ""stretch it out"", as well as to understand that the issue could be traced back to the network of muscles from my back and hips all the way down to that band of tissue past my heel. Meditation today showed me that my entire left side of my body is much more tight and constricted, and will need lots of attention to be where my right side is on a normal day.

306.0,Hi Adrienne I just want to say hi. I have never exercised before and I started meditating first and then I decided to try it. I went on you tube with people with personalities I didn't g=feel comfortable with. I am a 44 year old woman with type 1 diabetes on an insulin pump who is rapidly gaining weight. 3 months ago my 21 yr old baby had her 3rd brain tumor and surgery. I have no family help and she's staying with me in my tiny apartment because she has so many complications she can not be on her own . Between all this an unhappy boyfriend and a super stressful job I look forward every day to my time on the mat with my new best friend. I never new how to even leave a comment but I wanted you to know how needed you are. My neck used to click like six times when I rolled my neck and now it doesn't at all. I pray I can finish the coming episodes as it gets harder. But thank you Adrienne.,UgwECbt7tc2esccMxVp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-10-25T03:01:11Z,0.7679083943367004

318.0,"First of all: Thank you so much for your loving instructions. I hadn't been giving my body what it needed. After a brain tumor was removed, I was forced to retire. I'm 65 years old. I started the 30-day journey in January of this year. It's October and I'm finally on Day 8 LOL. I practiced the day from the series, then did the Foundations necessary to build the strength and understand better what I needed to be doing. I've had breaks with normal illnesses and find that I still have the strength. Today I realized how much I still need the stretching exercises. So, I plan to do more foundation practices until I can do this one with less pain. Before my Yoga with Adriene, I would walk into walls, trip over tiny bumps in the sidewalk. I'm a head person and hadn't really felt the rest of my body. A few will recognize what I'm saying. Thank-you for helping me to become grounded and to be able to feel my feet and legs when I walk.

AN IDEA :
Maybe you could make sleeping meditations, that people could play to fall asleep, and program in the dream, or ASMR audios, just one hour guided voice meditations, affirmations to listen and play, maybe music clips with mantras? something to play in the background during the day or some other audios to play during sleep.

But no matter what video day it is.  I leave that mat feeling great and ready to face the day.  

And I'm very happy I took this challenge. Sign me up for the next.",UgyreuYWZ6E_saSnEtV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-05-01T07:05:28Z,0.9993917942047119

Maybe because my legs hurt a lot in the cross legged position with one foot in front of the other, maybe because I was struggling and I wanted to be able to do everything, maybe because all the happiness of this week finally let some old pains and fears and sadness through that still had to come out.

I seriously thought it was only about half way done each time when the end came. I've done most of these 30 days of yoga series and haven't had that happen before.

Also, while I have done a fair amount of yoga in the past, I've done almost none in the last year. It started with an injury and then fear of re-injury and then just habit. It's so nice to get back into the habit, but also humbling to see how much flexibility I've lost.

607.0,"WOW. I don’t know if I’ve ever felt such profound peace and grounding from a single meditation session before. It’s been about 45 minutes since I completed Day 8, and I’m still entirely blissed out - breathing slowly and deeply, smiling gently, walking taller and moving my body more intentionally. Without even trying, I’m finding a level of presence that I usually have to work for... I’m deeply aware of the smell of the soap on my hands, the sounds of my knife slicing through an apple, the glistening of snow on the tree outside my window. I’ve been practicing with Adriene since close to the beginning, and I always feel amazing after YWA, but this is a whole new level! 
I’m taking part in this 30 day journey a month and some change after the fact, and it feels like it came into my life at exactly the right time. I couldn’t be more grateful for my morning YWA + hot coffee routine. 

Also, I put some peppermint oil in my diffuser today and set it close to my mat, and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Talk about breathing deeply! Highly recommend. Anyway, so grateful for this journey and this community. Adriene, thank you for the peace you help me find within myself. 🙏",UgzDKNYCqeyNKFO0vgN4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-02-10T17:24:39Z,0.9996452331542969

613.0,It’s like Adrienne knows just what I (and we) need! I’ve had a horrible flu the past two days and it’s the first time I’ve been this sick in years. But I saw yesterday’s video was only 17 minutes long and knew I could do it. I had about an hour where my fever abated and I had energy so I took it to do yoga since I haven’t skipped a day this year! It was quick and easy-breezy which was refreshing. I was troubled when I saw how long this video was and wasn’t sure if I felt up to it. But the sweat pants and pillow and blanky? Yes! That’s been my entire aesthetic for the day. This was the perfect practice for someone who is tight from the flu and needs to relax. Although breathing out of my stuffy nose didn’t happen and I definitely dripped a ton of snot every time we leaned our heads forward 😅 just what my achy back needed!!

771.0,"It's currently 1am in England and I just finished up with the practice, for the whole 8 days this has been going on (for me) I have made myself do every practice. 
Some days I'm way too hyper to function properly, sometimes I'm way too bored or out of it. Today it was late, I had just finished watching crazy rich Asians and I was ready to go to bed, but I made myself get up off my sorry ass and do the meditation practice for today. I lit a candle grabbed two pillows, closed my eyes and listened to Adriene's voice.
I was supposed to be trying (emphasis on TRYING) to write the first chapter of a book I've been wanting to write for years now, but instead, I did this, cause why not? 
I started doing yoga cause my mum said I should (she's Chinese so she was basically saying I was getting a little chubs and should work out more) so I did and it landed me here, to Dedicate. and let me tell you its super duper hard for me to dedicate to anything. but I'm trying, so let's hope it works out.
Have an amazing day my lovelies and I hope to see you again tomorrow!

847.0,"For reasons having to do with life, I have just done Day 8. Believe it or not, this is the one that kicked my butt the most so far! Bending forward with my legs crossed set off waves of panic. I settled in as best I could, noticing the panic, taking pauses, and also not quitting the pose. I can't get my forearms to the ground, my knees were screaming, and my head was nowhere near bubblegum fists! I could rest my forehead on my yoga block, but it was not restful. Very illuminating. Will I ever be able to lean forward like that without panic? I wonder. I shall revisit. Will also do Day 9 later today. I won't be able to catch up, but am doing bits and pieces of the practice at work during the day. Thank you.",UgynZq_a6rgrtV3ygNN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-16T17:46:33Z,0.985374927520752

I'm fairly fit and slim, have always done lots of sports especially rock climbing but also fall in to the stereotypical 'unflexible man' (spend too much time sat at a desk etc) category. Anyway... I found this episode REALLY hard. Up until now I've been pleasantly surprised that I've been able to follow along most of the way. But in the sitting pose, I can barely extend my leg straight (behind knee feels so tight!) never mind fold over towards toes. Same thing when cross legged, I struggle to sit up with nice straight back form, never mind folding over in front. Any suggestions for 'progressions' towards this goal?

Today I noticed even more than the other days the beautiful surroundings these practices take place in. It was a little foggy and the damp air seemed to cling to those big beautiful trees outside in the garden giving the red pines an even brighter colour! 
The practice made me relax and look inward which I guess I kind of needed. So even if I was actually looking for a bit of a workout today I really came to enjoy this more relaxed time with myself.

I got home from school and got some bad news from my schoolmates. 
One of my teachers had been absent for some days, but we thought she was just a bit I’ll.
Turns out she died today. She was an amazing old lady who taught us ethics and values. She made us laugh while showing astonishing things about life.
My eyes just could resist the pain, I cried .. it had been a pretty long time since I had lost someone important.
Despite all of my horrible depression I wanted to do yoga with you. I knew that it would calm me down.
Day 8 was just beautiful . Sometimes I think that your practices are coordinated with my mood; you’ve always got something to make me feel better! I’m going to my teacher’s funeral and will obviously cry, but will remember all of the amazing experiences we had while being together..

1047.0,"I'm one of those people who really struggles with corpse pose. I have lordosis and though I actively work to correct it, including with yoga, corpse pose is always at least a bit of a struggle. This practice felt so good. I never felt like I was pushing or hurting myself or doing any crazy openings but when I went to corpse pose at the end, my low back and hips were super stimulated and it took me a good while to get them to settle down. But as they did, breath my breath, I felt my back and hips opening up and slowly, naturally releasing onto the ground for the first time in a very long time. 

I've been sick the last week and taking it very easy (I'm mostly better now) but even so, thanks to this practice, I've felt my pelvis tucking and my shoulders unlocking so that the shoulder blades can come together and descend properly down my spine (they tend to sit high on me from a lifetime of trying to sit up straight from my shoulders and back instead of from my core and chest). In short, this 30 day practice is the best of all the years I've done it so far and I've been seeing real changes.

After this practice though, when we got to the part where we lay on our backs, 
my lower back hurt so much that I couldn't stay in the position. 
I had to change to child's pose because that felt better. 

But is there a reason my lower back could start hurting from any of the things we just did before? 
I know I have a kind of weak pelvis/lower back so I try to not push too much when doing these forward folds but even then it hurts 
(afterwards, when lying on my back, not during the fold). 

Should I avoid them or do you have any tips for me? 

Thank you!

Turns out the apartment above us had broken the line of their toilet trying to unclog it, and there was literal SHIT water dripping from our ceiling. Yup. Liquid shit. It was absolutely disgusting. Dealing with resident managers, plumbers, on call maintenance--what a nightmare. But somehow, I managed to fit this in. Pacing and fretting was doing nothing. It was all out of my control. So I turned to my yoga practice, knowing that it was the only helpful thing I could do in the moment. I cried, a lot. And then, your comments...I couldn't help but laugh: ""notice the smell in the room""...Well, it literally smells like shit! ""Notice the sounds around you""...Plumbing, sawing, boots stomping above, the dripping of water into a bucket in the bathroom...nothing could have been LESS peaceful! And yet, somehow I got through it. Lol. I don't even know what else to say but thank-you. I'm proud that I managed to show up on the mat even on the worst of days.

1327.0,"Today was a day at home, without kids, and a to do list and to be lost a mile long. I missed my morning gym class— I hadn’t even gotten out of my pajamas. The next one, I said, but that didn’t happen either. I sat. I ate. I lazed. I zoned. I was just so stuck and unmotivated and in my own headspace. I talked myself into being okay with missing practice today, that maybe I’d do day 8 and 9 together tomorrow. I came upstairs for bed, just feeling an overwhelming cloud of blah over me, but couldn’t shake something. I give up on myself too often, and this 30 day journey is about showing up for myself. So I turned off the lights, turned on the video, and did day 8 in my bed, in my pajamas, and could barely hold on the tears by the end. It was the practice I needed today. The exact practice I needed. It quieted what needed to be quieted and opened what needed to be opened. Thank you.",Ugyahei4K0avnhy0cdp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-10T03:06:26Z,-0.9958130717277527

One bit of feedback I have is about the sound – The music on most of your video intros is WAY louder than the rest of the program. What happens is we have to turn up your voice when you begin and, worst of all, after your final shavasana or any resting pose the music comes in SO loud it's startling!

1440.0,"Adrienne thank you for your videos. I’ve started yoga with you by following your other 30 day challenge back in November and December and the change in my everyday mindset and approach to work has shifted immensely. I feel like I’m back to my best self, someone who I thought I lost for almost a year and a half now. I used to feel extremely guilty when I couldn’t make it to the gym and exercise became just another task on my seemingly never ending to do list. I’m not sure which video it was, but you reminded us that this is exactly where we need to be and that has been my mantra going into the new year. Whenever my social anxiety starts to surface and I replay interactions in my head from that day, or I jump ahead to worrying about the future, I remind myself that this is exactly where I need to be and I am instantly calm. Yoga has now made me view exercise in a positive light and I am ready to go back to the gym at my own pace. My productivity is much more intentional and my downtime is much more purposeful as well. I have so much more mental clarity and have been able to fall back in love with some of my hobbies like journaling, music, and reading. You have done wonders for my mental health and I cannot thank you enough. 

Today was a particularly demanding day for me and I wasn’t able to fit in my yoga in the morning like I normally do. This practice was exactly what I needed to come back to after today. I’m so excited to continue on this yoga journey with you and I’m sending you so much love. 💕",UgzHNdKaUDJUExoGsKd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-10T00:43:10Z,0.99687659740448

1442.0,"So, I actually found today’s practice quite difficult, specifically in terms of staying focused and not letting my mind trail off. I thought about why and the only reason I can come up with is that I’m coming out of 2018 with a lot of shame and guilt precisely because I relaxed too much and didn’t do nearly enough work toward reaching my goals. 

Once the clock struck 12 on 1/1/19, I resolved to be a productive as I could possibly be every single day of 2019, so that I wouldn’t   repeat the previous year’s mistakes. Today wasn’t a very productive day for me, so I was already down on myself because of that and then when evening rolled around and I got into this practice, I kept feeling anxious and antsy, just waiting for something more active to take place so that I could stretch, and sweat and feel my heart race and somehow, in my own mind, redeem myself for not having done enough today. 

Clearly, today’s practice was the total antithesis of that “active ideal” and I just had a hard time dealing with it and being able to accept that relaxation is okay, even when your goal is to try your hardest every day. No shade at all is meant to you, Adriene, or today’s practice (which felt great physically); my gripe was internal in nature, a personal struggle with my very all-or-nothing mentality. Hopefully, I’ll get over it. 

Thank you for Day 8. 🙂",UgzDaQgZXHQAzvRN8VN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-10T00:45:10Z,-0.9176816940307617

I've had to argue with it (not particularly effective), be annoyed at it (again, little effect), accept it and hang out with it. It's amazing how the mat mirrors life. I tend to rush ahead (I'm one of THOSE people who love planning) and optimise for time. This practice, though, has guided me into gently questioning that rushing. Yesterday we were asked to set an intention and I got quite emotional: I choose to taste this moment. I continue to carry it with me.

1666.0,"Thank you so much for this week's practice so far. I started my Yoga with Adriene journey last fall and have experienced all the 30 (and 31) day programs. I have since (in my opinion) mastered my home practice, in the sense, I get up in the morning and play one of Adriene's final days (with just the music) with my headphones on my mat and practice ""what feels good"" for me that day, integrating everything I've learned. This September, I experienced a type 1 manic episode not knowing I was bipolar. I was first able to recognize this was happening because my ability to be mindful and stay in the moment was completely lost and unattainable. I was experiencing a lot of stress, which led me to try more mediation and yoga, only to find that I was not able to practice yoga or mindfulness at all. I have since started recovery with medication and therapy and I have gotten back into my daily yoga and I am able to be mindful, and observant of my breath. I even accomplished my 2018 resolution of a successful headstand (and have been doing more since)! I was very much looking forward to this year's new yoga journey to help remind me of the basics and integrity in poses and focusing on the breath. Adriene is truly doing some wonderful work for this world and I just wanted to share how positive this experiene has been for me. The 30 day journeys have taught me so much on how to care for myself each day and the repetoire of many other videos are so useful to have as resources for tough days of stress and anxiety. (My favorites are the stress relief practice, and the meditation for anxiety). I have shared this Youtube page with many mental health workers and professors, as well as friends and family. Thank you Adriene for helping me live a happier and healthier life which translates into me being a more positive and productive member of society and in my social groups <3",Ugy4PG0CGPzmwUDJr994AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-09T20:22:10Z,0.9954798221588135

I don't know how to explain it but you make everything comfortable and you can encourage people to just do their best and letting them know their best is enough.

Stronger. I am truly honored to be sharing this journey with y'all. Adriene, I would love to hear you talk about your moods a little more, like how you are feeling that particular day. Are you frustrated, tense, maybe upset about something? Bc I find trouble sometimes in engaging my Self in my practice due to negative feelings, and I would love to see a little more of how you deal with those moments as you're in them.

But then you spoke about honoring where your body is at right now, and I realized that I can control this. I can control if I show up on the mat everyday. I can control my attitude along this journey. I can control my thoughts toward my body.

After doing the last forward stretch and lying on the back, my lower back started hurting but I did not feel it during the actualy forward strech. Is this normal or does that mean I maybe pushed myself too hard?

It was interesting to notice how different the hip opening pose felt on either side of my body. When my right leg was in front of my left leg and I felt the stretch on my right hip, I was struggling and wishing to come out of the pose sooner. And while my left leg was in the front and my left hip was stretching, I felt so good I could have stayed in the pose much longer.

2145.0,"Sit still and disengage normal activities.
Draw energy from the earth,
Admit power from the heavens.
Fertilize the seed within;
Let it sprout into a flower of pure light.
And let brightness open the top of your head:
Divine light will come pouring in.
Your mind is empty,
Light seeps into your whole body.
Sitting cross-legged, with hands clasped,
As if trying to embrace the brilliant flood,
Your skin turns transparent.
How can a bag of skin hold divine magnitude?
Your last vestiges burn away in a torrent of infinity.

Only after indeterminate time do you return.
Flesh, blood, bone.
Were you gone? Or were you never here in the first place?
Where is the torrent?
It is not gone;
You’ve only closed to it once more.

2150.0,"I felt compelled to comment after todays practice.

I’ve followed you for over 5 years and always looked forward to your 30 days of yoga in January. This year I’ve found it so difficult due to experiencing high levels of nerve, joint pain especially hip/groin area brought on from prolonged periods of stress from losing both parents last year, one from aggressive cancer in April and the other from a sudden stroke in September.

I have turned up every day and often sat in a kneeling position as seated is so uncomfortable. I have tried not to beat myself up and send unconditional love to my body but today when I tried to bring my right foot in to cross my legs it just wouldn’t give at all, I felt so low and just wanted to get up and give up but something made me stay…..then I cried and I cried some more……

This such a tough journey, sitting with myself but one I need to be on…I am not going to give up on myself and I thank you for that

2213.0,"I was really looking forward to this Day 8, and it was just super yummy <3 <3 <3 
I noticed my mind was alternating from total focus on the breath and moves, to being compleetely elsewhere, but hey, it's a practice :) I also notice a diffference in the sitting forward folds, depending on whether it was my left foot or my right foot that was first folded in. I enjoyed being able to feel that, seeing it mindfully. I also feel very much Open now :)
From 623 to 1456 views : 833 people connected on this page as I was doing this flow. It's crazy. I love  seeing that. It gives me hope too, : the more yogis, the more mindful people, the better the world. <3 Thanks Adriene, thanks FWFG team ! <3

2248.0,"Adriene and Everyone: I'm writing this from beside a friend's bed in Emerge. She was missing, for over a week, and now is found. Imagine the words not in that short sentence. I had completed Day 7 literally minutes before the call she was found and being taken to hospital. Because of what I've learned while on my mat this week and from the many comments I've read, I was able to focus on being calm for my friend despite an emerge horror show around us. 

At one point I put my hand on her upper back and asked her if she'd ever done yoga (one of only questions I asked her). She said Years ago. So I took a deep breath, audibly, and literally thought of all of you and invited her to breathe along with me. It kept us calm and grounded and then she fell asleep. Please understand this comment is *NOT* intended to be about me but rather the incredible power of yoga and knowing there's a world of well-intentioned people out there. All you. And Adriene, it's meant as a thanks to you who makes this all available and accessible in so many ways. I'm humbled tonight, truly.
