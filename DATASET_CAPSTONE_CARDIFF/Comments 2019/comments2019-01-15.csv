Doing this practice after my housemates and I had an impromptu, makeshift graduation party for ourselves :) It felt sooo good to just unwind and let my body recharge and refresh. As we did the wide legged, reflection staring fold, my body moved so slowly, almost building heat with just that bend! You were starting to move on, but I made the choice to continue the journey down, letting my head get closer and closer to the earth. No contact was made (yet) but it still felt different, and as I observed my body in that moment, it was something new. Something that felt right to explore. Thank you so much!

In other words, it can be hard to properly work on breath, alignment and range of motion in each shape, if the pace is too high.

Even though I know, some poses will hurt, or I might be harsh to myself when I can't do something. But definitely it's getting better, not just my ""moves"", but the attitude towards my body and mind.  I don't feel guilty for eating, preparing good food, or taking care of myself. That's a huge step for me. I hope I helped someone who is thinking of starting or has some troubles showing up. And Adriene's loving, caring and friendly voice make my day suddenly good again.

306.0,"Man. I didn't think I'd comment throughout this journey. Getting on the mat hasn't been entirely easy or difficult for me. I've stuck with it, but wasn't feeling any sort of breakthrough or a shift in energy. But today was different. 

I never usually practice at home, and I've noticed how easily distracted I am at home with my To Do list not far away and dishes that need to be washed around me. I've had difficulty focusing on the practice. Today, however, I stopped at one cup of coffee, went to work and came home and cleaned up my apartment, took a long and contemplative bath then lit some candles and flowed through this. This was the first day where I just closed my eyes and trusted myself and Adriene to guide my body. Today was the first day I heard the ending music and didn't rush to my next thing. I just laid down and felt the energy in my body. The word ""grace"" fell through me. The feeling did too. Thank you Adriene. I didn't think I'd feel this today, or any time soon. I am so grateful towards this community. Towards myself. And towards the practice of moving and listening to your body that is yoga. <3",Ugys0c_5yZyGBoQUFcF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-28T06:10:59Z,0.9975513815879822

But there are a few things that frustrate me, because I know with a lot of poses that it will get better, and it aready has, but for example in low lunge I can't really lift my upper body because my arms are too short, and they will stay that length^^ Is this something other people experience too?

401.0,"It’s easy to get caught up in ’doing’, so it’s kind of fun to stumble or fall because it’s an opportunity for a nice, kind chuckle. Something I’ve worked to do is to say silly things or make cute noises when accidents happen, so when I fall or get unexpectedly hurt there’s no anger to bring in, instead I get to laugh and it also usually makes other people laugh too. 
I stumbled today but it gave me a chance to laugh, which makes me smile, and reminds me to not be so serious. The poses only work when you’re relaxed, not serious or tense.

Also, I hope it’s ok to ask, I’m not sure if there’s a way to change it so late but the difference in volume between the orchestra music and your voice is very big. I have hearing problems so I turn my tv loud to hear you, but the loudness of the orchestra is startling and causes me to rush out of the final quiet moment to get the remote to turn it down. Is it possible to lower it? No big if not! 
Thanks so much for this : ) I’m having a lot of fun connecting with my body, seeing how far I can already go and also learning where I need to take it slow and practice.",UgyHZsT7Zl7DK3ahWgR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-18T04:10:42Z,0.9977801442146301

693.0,"Adriene- I IMMEDIATELY started singing ""I feel the earth...move...under my feet; I feel the sky tumbling down..."" Not sure if that is what you were referencing, but that is what popped into my head :)                                                                                                                     
On a different note...I ALWAYS appreciate your quotes, prayers and little blurbs of inspiration.  I started following you and your yoga videos during my divorce, almost 3 years ago.  I needed something grounding- something for me- something to connect me to my true self.  I cannot remember which practice it was, but in it you said something along the lines of ""You need to believe that the universe is here for you.  All that is meant to be yours, is already yours.  Trust that the universe has your back"".  [not exact quote].  And THAT practice seriously broke me....in a good way.  That was the day that I decided that I was no longer [or ever again] going to feel sorry for myself or say ""woe is me"".  And you have truly impacted my life in such an amazing and unexpected way, there aren't enough words or actions to thank you.
Throughout your practices, your words of faith, inspiration and self-love are quotes that I use daily to encourage myself and friends.  Today's quote about the sails of grace spoke to me.  Currently, I'm going through a positive development and am unsure of what's next (in a good way).  I feel that you can substitute any positive word for ""grace"" and the saying would hold true.  Today, I'm going to repeat that quote to myself and use ""opportunity"" along side of grace.  If my sails are open, the wind will catch and propel me to the next stage in life!

My apologies for being so personal and lengthy....I whispered 'namaste' at the end of practice and was compelled to comment.  Many thanks and much love.",Ugw8dWMannLmrOyAJQZ4AaABAg,2.0,10.0,2019-01-15T18:21:16Z,0.9844553470611572

Instead of really worrying about anything else or anyone else I just want to spend this year becoming the person I want to be. The best version of myself! It’s okay to feel alone (which is a feeling I experience a lot) and like no one really has my back, because like Adriene said the mat will always have my back and so will I. This year I want to learn to love myself again and not let anything come in the way of that or compromise it!

729.0,"This entire journey thus far has been about grace for me. I'm learning to dedicate myself to the practice of yoga, but secondary to that is learning to give myself grace in everything and when I need it. I'm not able to do every posture because of tightness in my shoulders or not having worked out consistently in over a year. At first I was really hard on myself for that, but slowly I have become okay with that. And through giving myself grace, I've been able to accept my body in a way that I haven't done in a long time. I'm not harsh on my physical ability or the way that I look, and that is everything to me.",UgyYtsoDqEf8sMg5yit4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-15T16:36:30Z,0.9992882609367371

Today's practice made me realise that grace, for me, is finding lightness and humour. I think when tense/worried I default back into a 'what's important is serious' perfectionist mindset where everything has to be geared towards being good enough for others. Today's practice helped me realise that finding more lightness and humour in my life will help me to be closer to who I want to be (my true self) and in turn will extend a warmer more graceful energy to those around me. This journey is so jam-packed with life lessons. Thank you everyone. Namaste ❤",UgzIYvd0Ne25eRek3xx4AaABAg,0.0,55.0,2019-01-15T16:19:50Z,0.9993733763694763

907.0,"Thanks again Adriene.  I like in your videos that you (a) remember that people are diverse with regards to flexibility; for example in staff pose my head can only go forward a few inches, nowhere near even my thighs and many videos see people assuming that I could do that, (b) don't assume that everyone participating is a woman, and (c) how shall I put this?  You wear normal clothes and not clothes that some woman who do yoga videos wear that are pretty revealing and make me question what their motives are.  Something to sum up each of these points is that you come across as accepting.  Greetings from Wrocław.",Ugz78INDR7N7o-w2DON4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-15T09:58:57Z,0.9909119606018066
