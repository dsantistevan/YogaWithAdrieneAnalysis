We come to your videos for the quality and nice nature of your classes, but your jokes distract all of us from the process. So we're left in a predicament, we find your classes the best, but also irritating and distracting when you break into a song or attempt a joke.

When I realized I was an empath immediately hints of the fact that I had to learn Yoga came gently at first, as I couldn't stand yoga, which is hysterical as I have been a Yogi in many lifetimes. Then it became apparent that I had no choice. I don't like to go to Yoga places, the last time I went to a Siddha Yoga Center the women went nuts, exclaiming things like ""She is the one"", ""She is the real deal"". When this happened I didn't even know I was an empath, lol. Your videos are great! Easy to follow, and I love that you explain everything, why your bones must be stacked, etc...

293.0,"I've had the most enlightening and wonderful experience with this. Just as the practice was drawing to a close, I lay down on the mat and felt this sudden burst of warmth and cosiness. It felt as though in that very moment I managed to reconnect with myself on a spiritual level, and I could actually feel the gratitude towards myself for trying to incorporate more acts of pure self-love into my life. I've spent many years being strict and condemning myself, all the while ignoring my own voice. I started bawling my eyes out on the mat, but it was magical and so relieving. I'd read about other people having to cry after practice, but only now I fully understand. I'm slowly tearing down the wall between my body and my mind.

428.0,"I am new to yoga.  I did the 30 day series and am now repeating it,  getting a better understanding and improving my awareness this second time around.  I am a dressage rider, and my horse is about 250 miles south of me for the winter for additional training and physical conditioning.  The weather these past three weeks in the midwest made it impossible for me to do my weekly drive to ride my horse. I was able to get down there 2 days ago and my trainer commented on how much stronger my core and shoulders were during my lesson.  I had thought that the Dedicate series was helping me to be more flexible,  but now I realize how it is actually making me stronger throughout my body and is truly helping me to be a better partner for my horse.

I'm an adult Irish dancer who's currently figuring out how to navigate a foot surgery that took away some mobility and strength, potential shin and hip issues, and the fear of even more debilitating injuries that has sprung up alongside these problems... not to mention the weight gain that has come from being inactive; I've put on about 15-20 pounds, and though I'm not overweight, I can definitely feel the restrictions of my new proportions. I haven't felt like my old dancerly self in almost two years, and it's been extremely discouraging feeling like I've been shut out of not only dance, but any activity with any degree of impact. I started to forget that even a little exercise is better than none, and that it's ok -- necessary, even -- to work within my current limitations rather than waiting for them to go away and then jumping back into intense dance training.

I turn my phone off and disconnect from the world (especially social media!) and connect with myself for at least an hour through Adriene's Yoga Practices and every time I learn something new; absolutely addicted and in love with Yoga and cannot ever imagine quitting now that I've started. 
Best Part is: I used to be super unflexibel and I did Pole Dance for a while which really helped, though in my mind I still think I'm quite inflexible but then I get into Yoga Poses and surprise myself. Definitely finding confidence in my body and trust in my abilities as well.

I've loved and enjoyed your series for many years Adriene, but did so quietly. Today I am older, wiser and even more grateful. With the intention of gratitude for this year ahead, I wanted to take my time out today and say thank you. You mentioned if someone was a yogi practicing for more than 20 years, they would fine nourishment just as I had done. I am turning 21 soon and at the same time coming close to a five year practice with you, and I wholeheartedly look forward to practicing with you in the near and far future.

663.0,"Hello and thank you Adriene.  Yesterday I started with my second round of 30 days, having found 30 days of yoga from 4 years ago first. I know, I'm a bit late to the mat, but I have to say, I've never gone 30 days in a row of anything on my own. In the past I've hired personal trainers at the gym to keep me accountable, but even that didn't stick for very long. I've always wondered if yoga was a better option for me since I was constantly in fight mode (stressed all the time). I'm so excited to hit the mat every morning now that my hubby laughs at night when I recheck the video for the next day. I know you've heard so many thank yous, but here's one more, thank you from the bottom of my foundation - you have taught me an undeniable strength in me. Looking forward to these 30 and beyond. 
Much love, and namaste from France

Today the practise was very hard for me. I'm from Italy and horrible things are happening: it seems that people have forgotten what means to be human, what means to exist together.

I‚Äôve been doing yoga for three years and suffered a right wrist injury in the summer because all my weight was going into my right hand for those three years, as I couldn‚Äôt get my left inner elbow facing forward. Also got a load of shoulder pain everytime I did yoga. 

I‚Äôm practicing on all fours getting the elbows forward, already I‚Äôm noticing a lot of improvement! I‚Äôm finally using my left arm muscles! 

I‚Äôm noticing that when I do downward dog they naturally turn inward, is this healthy? Should I forgo DD until flexibility in elbow/shoulders have improved?",Ugy-rscQ7pcn-QoepNZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-04T16:52:48Z,-0.9575598239898682

920.0,Feeling so good after this practice today. Felt a nice bit of heat during this session! But I am also struggling with learning to love my body. My belly and breasts often get in the way of some poses for me. Especially traditional child's pose. But learning to modify poses  for my body is helping me! Taking the knees wide during child's pose I have found works well for me to create more space.

Finding your channel gave me access to yoga, which I'd previously avoided because of the expense and the shame I felt in public classes (which completely disconnected me from my body). Practicing with you has, over time, revolutionized my mental and physical health. I have introjected your voice and can turn to you for guidance when I am out of touch with reality. This has been therapy, more than anything--as I'm sure you know. I'm so glad you have taken the risk to do this work. You are a very bright star in this sometimes dark world. And, what I actually came here to say: you've truly outdone yourself this time. These videos are fantastic. Thank-you so, so much.

yoga isn't about fitting into the positions. it's about connecting to your body--your whole body--and your wellness. if a pose doesn't feel good for you, don't do it. you're not a bad yogi or doing it wrong if you are aware that a pose hurts you--especially true for people who want to do inverses, back bends, or even tabletop.",UgxIm4LdxdXvoO7qejt4AaABAg,21.0,249.0,2019-01-03T19:01:51Z,-0.9952667951583862

1397.0,"Yesterday was flat out humiliating, but worth it. Today, I feel more humbled than humiliated. Two days in, and I feel twice as better than when I started. But that's like saying I improved from 5% to 10%, and that's the humbling part. I have so much more ""quieting"" to do internally. I'm still very conscious of how long 40 minutes is out of my day, still mindful of all the things I keep going over, that I should be tuning out and focusing on just yoga. My mind is still busy and pre-occupied/distracted by all the noise of my daily life. My breathing is surprisingly counter-intuitive, and struggling to find aerobic synchronicity with Adriene's instructions. I can already tell that this journey will be worth it, that all the things I am becoming aware of are things I do need to address. It's still daunting that the journey itself is not going to be quick or easy. I feel like the fat kid's second day at the gym, or the crippled's second day in rehabilitation. I know this is necessary, I'm willing to show up, just a bit humbled by how much showing up I'm going to have to do to get there. This is counter-intuitive to my natural tendency of just ""plowing through it."" I can't just knock this out in a few hours or binge all the episodes in a day. It will literally be just one day at a time. But it is necessary. Today, like yesterday, I've got to take what I've learned, and consciously apply it throughout my day. Just like yesterday. Just like tomorrow. And all the days that lie ahead. Until it's not so conscious, til it's reflexive.

One day, I will be bragging about this journey. One day, everyone will notice the difference. One day, I'll be talking with someone who is where I am at right now, and convincing them that it's totally worth sticking to. But that day will never come if I don't stick with it all the way through. So today, I'm eating a lot of humble pie, and I'm going to #JustKeepSwimming swimming swimming.",UgwKwDEZlC9LAG8o07F4AaABAg,4.0,70.0,2019-01-03T17:03:11Z,0.7402496337890625

1689.0,I struggled more today than yesterday. My sinuses really didn't want to play nice but I'm glad I made it through. It was overall a nice feeling getting back in touch with my body in spite of needing to work through my frustrations at not quite being well and my negative thoughts about the weight I've put on this past month. Finding my stomach and thighs in the way in poses where I know it wasn't before. I do feel a thread of hope that I can still do the best for myself moving forward from here all the same. Thank you for stating that whether or not the palms reach the floor in dandasana is fully about how long your arms are. I know this is almost obvious but it can be easy to slip in toxic thought when it feels like your body shape doesn't fit the instruction and I can wonder what I'm missing so I always appreciate when yoga instructors are clear about what is dictated by anatomy.

1697.0,"Alright my pals, I'm gonna share my thoughts and story with yall.
Right now at 18:22 of the video I had a circulatory collaps. I have this a few times a month and it all started about 6 years ago in PE (I just turned 17 last month soo....). About 1,5 year ago I was at my worst. I had this numerous times a month and while getting my period I just passed out. This went on for a whole year till I had some serious health problems (my doc didnt think that me passing out every month was serious). Since that point I am on birthcontrol and it kinda helps with my whole condition (besides all the side effects). My circulatory callapses happen less, but they still happen sometimes. 
I also have been skinny and frail al my life and never had much muscles. So I decided to build some a half year ago when I started having judo in school (I didn't wanted to lose every dammn match just bc I am the smalest and weakest). 
I've been fitter ever since, but I'm still not very healthy and most of the muscles I could build up are in my arms (now I am at a normally strong point, but still weak xD). And when I realised that all my workouts haven't helped me that much, I searched for a way to build up muscles all over my body at once. That's when I found yoga.
I'm practicing yoga daily for a month now and after the first week I could already see results in my flexibility.
So I am excited to join dedicated and to become healthier! this is challenging for me ( I mean it took me 30 min to recover from the collaps xD) but I am dedicated!

Lots of Love!
