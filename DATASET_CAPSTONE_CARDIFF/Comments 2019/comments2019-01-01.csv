189.0,"Adriene, I just wanted to tell you that I found you out of sheer desperation.  I have neck and shoulder pain (was in bed for two days with a spasm last week) and last night, I just couldn't see the benefit in taking even one more pill and waiting for it to take effect.  I was in the mindset that if I was in pain, I needed to be still and wait for it to subside (as a former ballerina and now dance instructor, I can't even believe I thought this).  But I found myself trying to stretch the pain away and move and it dawned on me that movement might actually help.  So I jumped on the old Youtube and found your Yoga for neck pain 10 minute video and when I noticed I felt BETTER I decided to do two more short bedtime videos (also because you are so sweet, calming and inviting I didn't feel weird or lost, but inspired).  I went to sleep last night with 90% of my pain gone.  I woke up and did a morning yoga video.  For the first time in my adult life, I left my house for work feeling happy and refreshed rather than frantic and generally upset that I was awake at all!  I have a desk day job (unfortunately) so when the neck pain got too unbearable, I jumped back on the Tube and found your desk yoga.  Instant game changer.  Tomorrow, I'm starting your 30 Day Dedicate series. I know I'm late to the game, but I'm thrilled to be here to learn and grow.

354.0,"I vividly remember the previous 30 days yoga challenge during the beginning of 2018, it was an amazing journey that familiarized me with the world of Yoga, deep breathing, and its calm nature which can easily be both intense and relaxing. 

After completing the 30 day challenge I decided to continue doing daily yoga but eventually I failed and stopped, now its time to get back on track! 
Namaste.

Doing your videos makes me realize that exercise is about being kind to your body and listening to it, not pushing it to exhaustion.

1100.0,"‚ÄúThe time of beginning is one of the most precious times of all. It can be very exciting and full of wonderful growth. The first thing to do is to make up your mind that you are going to go the distance.

When I first began, I made a lifelong commitment. I determined that I would learn from my teacher for the last seven years. Now, it has been much longer than that, but the essential element is still the same: Commitment.

But commitment needs something else in other to be perpetuated. It needs discipline. This perseverance to keep on when things are tough. Adversity is life¬¥s way of testing and perfecting a person. Without that, we would never develop character.

Rice suffers when it is milled. Jade must suffer when it is polished. But what emerges is something special.  If you want to be special too, you have to be able to stick to things even when they are difficult.

Commitment and Discipline----- these are two of the most precious words for those who would seek Tao.‚Äù
