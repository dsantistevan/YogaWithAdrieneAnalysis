34.0,"So my yoga journey started back in nov 2020, I’d been telling ppl for years that I thought I would love yoga but never did anything about it until I found Adriene’s short 10 minutes video for absolute beginners. Did that 5 days in a row then did a few random videos the next few days until I found HOME. Did that AMAZING journey in about 45 to 50 days. I was totally ok with not doing consecutive days. Then!! BREATH!!! That was awesome! And I was able to do all 30 days conservatively. Then I rolled right into DEDICATE ❤️ so 41 consecutive days today. All of this to say today really felt like I’ve made so much progress and everything seemed doable and I had a new sense of confidence. 

Adriene, you are the best teacher and I’m so fortunate to have found your channel! I can’t wait to see where this journey will take me 100, 200, 365 and more days down the road.

53.0,"My left leg during that balance was shaking, trembling, wobbling so much like a Loony Tunes jelly - but I did not fall! I had the courage to keep going, and even though I was 99% absolutely going to fall, I kept pulling back to my centre and I did - not - fall. There is absolutely nothing shameful about falling, but this practice, and that moment, for me right now, is excruciatingly relevant. I'm trying to catch a wave into the veterinary industry at the moment, and the constant pushback has proven so difficult, and sometimes it takes me to a dark place. Thank you for teaching me today that I can always find the courage to keep going, and that against all odds, I might not even fall <3 Namaste xXx

76.0,"To anyone else who broke the chain, and is feeling guilty - After completing Day 10, I suffered an ankle injury while playing badminton, and was not able to do any yoga for 4 days. I was scared of coming back to the mat, and aggravating the injury, and tbh was a little scared after seeing the crow pose in the thumbnail also :p

I realized though that this session is all about courage, and today I ended up on the mat, wanting to be courageous. I'm so glad I did! Feels absolutely wonderful. 

I was even able to hold the crow pose for a couple of seconds (whereas could barely rock onto it when I did Home)! Yay for my wrists getting stronger! Certainly helping my badminton game also 😁

Thank you so much for existing Adriene. Namaste 🙏🏻",UgxX9tzv8s2AV2dbJ354AaABAg,0.0,5.0,2020-06-08T16:57:55Z,0.9986039996147156
77.0,"Doing Dedicate so far has been really profound both mentally and physically. First I did HOME and I didn't want to stop daily practices so I chose to continue with Dedicate. For some reason exercise is almost like a straight line in my head, you know from start to finish but no I have had it wrong(I think this stems from my competitive sports background). I thought that since I've been doing this for awhile this is a breeze(hahahahahaha how wrong was I, now I have learned and started to appreciate my shaking muscles,like Adriene has said 'how it feels to be alive today')
Today I realized that this journey through mind and body is a spiral and each day even though I think I'm strong the practice makes me humble, brings me back to the present and always always finding something new. 
This practice, yoga is such a huge blessing in my life I am afraid to even find the words but each day through each practice I have more courage.

It's very easy to feel like i'm not good enough when i fall over but Adrienne telling me everyone is catching me if i fall is so comforting! We have to allow ourselves to fall in order to get stronger and keep trying.

This is something that is so important in real life and I love that you are teaching us how to treat ourselves with love and understanding, not only on the mat, but in life.

I know what this connected me to and why I felt the way I did. That's kind of rare for me with Yoga. Usually, if I have emotional releases, I don't know what they're about. It's empowering to come face to face with unresolved subconscious issues, to be able to say, ""I accept this, and I release this."" I started with the 30 days of Yoga and moved to Dedicate when I finished it. Early on I realized this was way more than exercise. There have been a few days I've wanted to quit because of mental anguish brought up in various poses.

296.0,"My mum and I are loving the daily practice. Adriene, your way of explaining what to imagine is so wonderful and really helps to visualise so that the body and muscles get the maximum through the asanas while keeping this lovely connection to the breath. Thank you so much. Keep going strong!

Fun fact for those interested in languages and imagery (as I am) 
In Sanskrit or Hindi (which I speak) Bak = crane. Kak = crow. In the practicing of the asanas the poses are similar. And I really love the flow Adriene created to get us to the point of courage to try it. 😘👏🏼👏🏼
So some of us may have managed to straighten arms in the last pose rather like the long legged Crane = Bakasana. And some of us may have managed to balance using crooked arms looking more like the shorter legs of the Crow = Kakasana. Either way more power to you!

I have tried doing the crow before but I couldn't do it so today decided to trust you and tried once again. I was really surprised and happy that I could hold it for 25 seconds. It usually takes a while to get to convince myself to exercise but I've been looking forward to these relaxing times with you while pushing my limits and loving my body.

One of the more frustrating days I’ve had as I spent most of the time concerned with my balance or getting caught up. The last pose was impossible. I would like to practice this more but feel the safer option would be to work on other poses first.

Anyone have any balance suggestions? (My pinky toes have always been pretty bent/curled towards my ring toes, even when I stand.. so that may be part of the problem)

I wanted to give a reminder for those of us doing yoga in larger bodies-- days like today might feel discouraging, and you might feel like you're ""giving up"" on a pose before you're supposed to. But yoga is, at the end of the day, a series of beautifully connected bodyweight exercises, and those of us who are heavier aren't weak or ""wimping out""-- we are, in gym parlance, doing fewer reps with more resistance!

387.0,"I'd like to share a little story about my yoga journey. :)

A few hours after yesterday's practice, I made a small movement while sitting at my computer. Suddenly, my neck was struck with a terrible pain. I could barely move my head and had the worst night's sleep, and it was no better in the morning. I have quite a bit of anxiety, but I managed to get myself to the physiotherapist the next morning in a bit of a panic.

That panic soon subsided. It was a GREAT visit (and not just because of the massage! XD). He showed me some neck stretches and strengthening exercises and said, echoing Adriene, that self-care and mindful movement is so important in dealing with injury and pain. He was also SO happy to hear that I'd been doing yoga every day for the past 10 days. 

It really hit me then that I had learned to view pain as something fearful, indicative of danger, and to freeze up when it occurs. But some pain is just an alarm bell with no underlying harm, or harm that will heal with proper care and patience. A huge part of dealing with pain involves movement and being soft, kind, and yep -- having courage!

So instead of giving up on yoga entirely, I did one of Adriene's softer neck and shoulder practices that day, just to be safe. But today I decided to continue the 30 day journey. I really had to have courage this time -- not only to do these awesome yoga poses, but also to take initiative and change it up when the poses were not appropriate for me (the physio said to avoid putting too much weight on either side), and to be very aware and kind to my neck. I have been pushing too much on some of these exercises, and I am now much more aware of that.

I saw my physio again too, and the last thing he wrote on the take-home exercise notes was ""Keep up the yoga! :)"" 

So thank you, Adriene. This truly is a journey, and like you said in this video, it takes real effort go inside and to deal with all the stuff we have built up inside our hearts and minds (and of course it takes effort to move our mindful butts now and again too). Much love to you and to everyone else practicing out there! <3",UgzfVCHFDZuRemWLxu94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-26T05:17:33Z,0.9807471632957458

More like a fish out of water, flopping about, trying to find their place of belonging. This dedicate journey is teaching me to be my own friend, like the one I am to others. I have never felt so strong in warrior three, or been able to hold it for that matter. It's been a year or so since I have done crow and look forward to learning again with this solid foundation. In other interesting developments, I had a successful mediation session this morning for what very well may be the first time ever! My mind is occupied with many hamsters running on wheels and I have always struggled with focusing on the breath. Today felt easier, dare I say natural? I kept thinking of day one and feeling my lungs expand and then hugging into my core. 
You are a natural born teacher and have a way with people. So full of gratitude for this space and this journey and everything you continue to show me.

503.0,"I’m a few days behind (but I have more to be proud of that I fell behind but picked back up) so I’ve been watching the thumbnail on this one, nervous that I’d have to do that pose. But I still showed up to the video and worked through everything, not concentrating on that pose, knowing I’d get to it when it happened. This was a tough practice for me because I’m a toe-walker, so I haven’t yet built stability in my core of the muscles of my legs that work when I’m flat footed. I stumbled, but still went through it. I got to that pose and well, I tried. I didn’t get much lift off the ground before I fell. But I’m still happy I tried. I look forward to coming back to this video as I progress and gain more and more strength. Because I know that it’s ok not to get it on my first try, even if I’ve been able to do everything else so far, and it’s going to be so rewarding when I finally can.

528.0,"The ending of this session was really emotional for me. Somehow, your videos always seem to find me at the right time.
Yesterday, I was planning to catch up on the two days from last week when I couldn't practice. But something happened ; an old pain woke up in my body, around my left shoulder blade and I could barely move or leave the bed. I tried to do this video, but it just hurt so much, I had to stop after three minutes. I really wanted to cry, because I was craving for some yoga, and I simply... Couldn't. I felt so frustrated with myself, even though I had done nothing wrong.
So I decided to be patient. I rested. Didn't move for the whole afternoon and evening. Had a bad case of anxiety when I looked at myself in the mirror and saw my neck all crooked (I really was the bent neck lady from the Hounting of House Hill !). But still. I waited. I was tired from all the pain, but sleep had trouble to find me.
I'm so used to my body working almost perfectly that this kind of episode releases a lot of judgemental thoughts and fears. Yesterday... Was hard.
But today was another day, so I decided to turn up on the mat. To try again. To meet my edge peacefully if it was too much for me. My neck and shoulder blade didn't hurt as much, but I wanted to be cautious.
Today, I held my first crow pose.
And I was so excited, I almost sunk my teeth to the floor when I attempted it for a second time.
The next instant, I was laughing like a mad man.
Then I listened to you, Adriene. I truly listened to you. And I've had trouble holding my tears, since then. But these are good tears. They're okay. I'm okay.
You're teaching me so much, Adriene. About myself. About self love. I can't thank you enough for everything you're doing for this community.
To everyone who had the courage to read until now : thank you. Remember yesterday is nothing like today and today is nothing like tomorrow. I want to believe we'll all end up being okay 💙

601.0,"I woke up one day with a feeling i want to do yoga for physical reasons.  Searched yoga for beginners and of course found this channel. I kinda hate social media/youtube/etc and all the superficial, low quality, dumb things living a happy life there, so didn't expect much.  But here I am on your channel 50 days later, doing your videos together with the namaste stuff daily and cannot believe myself - i am not the spiritual type AT ALL (or  at least I thought so :-) ). It speaks volumes about the quality of the content here. I want to thank you for all your energy, thoughtfullness and intelligence you put into all these videos to bring yoga closer to people. I am very sure it takes a lot from you, and i am also sure I cannot give it back through a computer screen, so I just wanted to wish to you that as much as you have courage doing this, you'll also have the courage to recognize if and when it becomes toxic for you to keep this up.

841.0,"Its been since November that I started to do yoga with Adrienne every day. What I learn from Adrienne are three major things.  1. how much a difference mindful exercise can make. Before I was doing x number of push ups etc and all it was is just mindless repetition I felt the pain the next day and I was exhausted not energized after a workout 2. Considering your own head as a ""beautiful extension of your spine"" this made me realize how posture is important and thinking to my head this way made me self conscious about the way I hold my head in general. 3. Be kind to your body and find what feels good. Its okay not to be able to follow the practice 100% you can make adjustments in the way if something is difficult for you. As long as you show up and try your best every day is all that matters. Thank you, Adrienne!",Ugwb_moDy8ecSJUnATp4AaABAg,5.0,187.0,2019-01-12T18:45:24Z,0.979001522064209

Above all I think it's the whole approach...how boring it is if you set about things with gritted determination..how much better if you can get the whole thing of being present, in the moment, doing this playfully, with fun. This is what makes this such a great form of exercise to look forward to. A small gender plea here. I think it's a shame that more guys (for whatever reason) don't do yoga. Why not? They could benefit just as much. I'm just guessing here, but judging by the comments male yogis here, they must be well under 5%.
