You don‚Äôt need to sacrifice love for self and truth - for a ‚Äúgood body""!
Your body is already good, let‚Äôs work for it instead of on it.
Be disciplined about THAT.
It requires both mind and body conditioning.
After all, what is the point of having a ‚Äúgood body‚Äù if you are still looking in the mirror and not knowing or loving who you see?",Ugygwoh9CIDWxY9o2fB4AaABAg,8.0,485.0,2019-01-23T14:22:10Z,0.9646157026290894

Have tried osteopaths but nothing really helped.  aNY suggestions?  I know it's har dto say from a distance but I have to ask.

25.0,"Wow just wow. The timing for this particular video was uncanny. I've been taking my time and odd pace and sometimes with even weeks of falling off the bandwagon. Started with home and then continued off with dedicate. And today, more so than any other, your past you was telling the present me exactly what I needed to hear. 

I work in retail, in Stockholm city. And today there was an illigal protest of non-covid-believers, thousand-something people all adrenalined up shouting for a more ""Free Sweden""..... the vibe was thick in the air and they marched right past my store. (like for anyone who's interested but maybe unaware, Sweden has had the most relaxed covid-policy in more or less the whole world (not even a singe lock - down) and is also one of the most privileged and free countries you can speak of... But there was police everywhere and we had to lock the door cause customers felt unsafe.
 A customer right before that,  who shared their belives went verbally savage on me and my coworkers for asking him to use sanitizer before touching unpackaged products..  
And then just the whole commute home...was packed. Of course I wear a mask but so so many don't. 
When coming home I knew before I do anything else I NEED to ground and do some yoga with Adriene. This video was next. Hit me in the feels. THANK YOU. Two years later and your videos are still helping people feel more sane <3

I'm proud of myself for sticking with it.  I wanted to tell you that I found today's unusually difficult.  You see, I have a Maine Coon cat who spends very little time alone.  Today was one of the rare occasions that he had been alone most of the day.  I got home from work, changed into my yoga ""wear,"" rolled out my mat and began.  When I got on the floor my cat was there with me. While purring he would head butt me every time I went to downward facing dog.  When I went to plank he would weave himself in and around my arms, in baby cobra he would come up to my face purring and bump his nose to mine. I got lots of laughs and love with this video.  :)",UgzTr1964543HE5W5U54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-03-14T01:00:03Z,0.9988704323768616

We haven't really started yet, but just talking about my past has given me some bad dreams and old emotions are resurfacing themselves. I've been taking care of myself with yoga, meditation and running. Last night I got high with a friend and had a really bad trip - flashbacks, paranoia, anxiety, everything. It was like being in a nightmare. I skipped my yoga that day, because doing it in that state wouldn't be safe. I am still scared and a bit shaken today, but I did this practice and feel better for showing up and sticking to a routine.

Did good all the way up to the last side plank, where all the pain in my neck and pressure in the wrists really got to me. When the left and right sides of my body are not balanced, I get very unstable emotionally as well. I kind of collapsed physically and emotionally after the last side plank and went straight into childs pose and let myself quietly cry it out. The last pose I just sat with my legs slightly bent and trying to stretch my neck. It definitely sucked to cry and all the self-doubt most definitely wasn't fun. however, I was able to very quickly stop myself from blaming myself negatively for the ""failure"" and just started saying ""it's okay"" to myself instead of hating my body for not being able to do the toughest variations perfectly. 


Today's practice helped me understand that physical balance for me, is heavily linked to my emotional balance, and having a tough day on the mat is okay and necessary to learn when modifications are necessary.",UgxNAm14oOKXfaWAkgd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-05T03:58:37Z,0.5781673192977905

259.0,"Tues., 2/5/19: Today's session made me realize how disconnected I usually am to my core center, my belly. And this is the first time I've fully realized why. I realized that I don't like how fat my belly looks. But I immediately turned that expression towards something kinder and just asked myself, ""Can I love my *soft* belly?"" And I continued to looks at reasons for loving it the way that it is. It makes a great pillow for others to lay on. One day it may house another life form. Even if it doesn't look it, it has been strong enough to carry me through 22 days of ab challenges and yoga routines. And I did Whole30 to try and show it more love and give it the nutrients it needs to help support me better. It's true, one day I hope it will look as strong as it feels, but I think for me to get there, I have to start loving it the way that it is, so that I can connect more to it when things get tough.

I have began thinking of doing Dedicate again for the Month of February since I have done another of you 30days before and wanted to keep it fresh/keep me wanting to come back to the mat/home. Any suggestions for creating an at home practice? I might shy away/bore/not show up when doing Dedicate again(a second time) since I've done it once before though... You probably have a couple other yoga 30days that I just havent seen(although I know I have done one of them already).

2. Did it in the morning for first time (10:45 is still morning).

I have some long-term health issues as a result of damage to the brain when I was younger. I don't really consider them as problems anymore. I have found ways to manage my memory, mood (mania, anxiety, depression, panic attacks) and mindset, through mindfulness, keeping a journal and enjoying the simple things life brings. These videos are a huge part of that healing. And I am so grateful to be on this journey. Life is a gift and I thank you with every part of my heart for helping me to honour that. I have accepted myself fully. I am observing my emotions without judgement; and that is so much easier than fully embodying them and allowing them to become me.
