Let’s re-UP our commitment today!

37.0,I am all about honesty here. I didn't want to come to the mat today. I felt awful 😞.  Not because I didn't want to come to the mat. That was the reason. I woke up earlier with a migraine and it took me 1.5 hours to get my but up and make my way to the mat... you want to know something though.. this practice I started with a fairly bad headache (assuming a stress headache) after this 17 min practice.. my headache is almost non-existent.. go figure making myself get on the mat was the best daily choice.. usually it takes 3 to 4 extra strength tylenol and an ice pack... I took two extra strength tylenol and this wonderful practice... as as I type my headache is disappearing.. thank you for this practice today.. I know it is me getting to the mat that matters but if I didn't have a wonderful person like you to follow I don't think I would get to the mat daily. 🙏🧘‍♀️ Namaste 🙏,UgzEJ63AsA6RBo3mEQx4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-04-16T11:11:29Z,-0.7274697422981262

I dropped 22 pounds and about 2 inches off my waist. I’m picking up more weight I guess because of muscle mass increase.????  My waist remains the same and I’m breathing much better.

92.0,Thank you Adrienne. I recently tore ligaments in my knee ( including my acl). I have had 3 previous surgeries due to volleyball injuries but this time I had entered a new space and have a new understanding of how we can heal our bodies ( on all the different planes)- so I went to alternative medicine. I have been experiencing beautiful Chinese medicine along with powerful meditations and cell regeneration frequencies.  my body has finally recovered to a place where I could start strengthening again and I was brought here to this beautiful practice! I have not missed a day and wow my strength has come back and even better than before and by allowing us to stay aware of ourselves and where we are I am so in tuned with my knee and it is thriving! Thank you for your approach to yoga as well as your deeper spiritual knowing and space you hold.  I am now able to walk without any crutches and even hike small trails again! Pretty amazing what the body can do with the right connected energetic support! You are a part of my healing journey!

Sometimes way more, and sometimes just a little bit better but it ALWAYS helps.

Listening to your own body, taking the time to focus on what you really need and  what you want and not what society may expects from you and really feeling every part of your body 100%.

I had got to the stage of not been able to sleep! My hips and back were so painful and thanks to an emergency Caesarian section I had no core.. Walking any distance was impossible never mind riding again. Even before this I struggled with anxiety and insomnia. I lived on medication and was basically told by the doctors that this was my life and to get used to it. 
However a friend recommended I tried Yoga with Adriene . Her word were "" you will love it she even has a doggy helper"" .. Well after that I just had to try. So for the last two months I have been doing the odd video a few times a week and Im hooked. I started with the beginner video and then I started the Dedicate 30 day videos. Im like a different person! I can touch my toes again! I think the last time I managed that I was a child. I no longer have to take medication to sleep and after not riding for over two years Im back on board and my core is probably better than it has ever been.

130.0,"Been doing yoga every day during lockdown here in the UK. Started with Home then had a couple of months looking at your individual videos then decided to do another 30 day challenge. Felt like these last few days I have just been going through the motions of yoga, I've been physically in the poses but not mentally felt like I've shown up. Got a little hard on myself for not being open to the practice. Hell, I've been hard on myself for not being present in my day to day life, I've been sad, stressed, scared and everything that comes with this pandemic, and still I hated myself for not being more, feeling more or doing more. 
Today the poses were everything I needed and I felt like my spirit had come back to the work. I feel so much more alive and happy after this practice!
When Adriene said HIP DIPS, I was like NOOOOO I do not want to. I hate these, I cant do it. 
Her saying 'the struggle is real, it's part of life. but its how we handle it' just made me realise and appreciate all the planks and difficult postures she gives us to practice. It really doesn't matter if you can do it or not. How do you handle those difficult positions? Do you give up, do you cheat? Do you half arse it? And that reflects a lot of what we do in real life. Id just never connected the two. 
Safe to say I then tried the hip dips and was no swan whilst doing so. But I had a smile on my face and laughed when I fell.

279.0,"I never leave comments, but I just have to say that...about 10 practices ago, I noticed my muscles being to loosen. About 5 practices ago, I realized that I actually understood what it meant to be grounded, to fill my space with ME, to appreciate that space and rely on the 4 corners of each foot and each hand and to FEEL every part of my movement. Moving with intention. 


I even danced for the first 18 years if my life, and never did I truly understand the way my body connects to the earth...in a solid way. 


This is not the 1st time I attempted one of your 30 days, but I've never gotten to day 15, and I've never loved it and NEEDED it until now.

281.0,"I can’t believe I only discovered yoga with Adriene recently and delighted to be at the half way mark. I started this journey to help improve my posture and now throughout the day I hear Adriene’s gentle voice in my head saying “head over heart, heart over pelvis, find what feels good” and more and more I find myself needing to make less posture adjustments as they are naturally happening as a result of committing myself to this 30 day practice. My calves are so tight and I’ve been stretching them outside of my practice and what has really revealed itself to me is mindfulness!! I used to get so frustrated before trying too hard to be “mindful” and then feeling guilty for not being “mindful.” Instead of jerking through stretches and getting bored, I am now “finding what feels good” and this new mantra is now at the centre of how I move and I am forever grateful!

300.0,"Took me 19 days to get here, a couple days out for travel plans and another couple after twisting a knee moving things around the house (yeah I know, finally can be active again after 5 years and I hurt myself moving a box...insert jokes here lol). But it's been a great ride so far all the same.

It's both amusing and frustrating that the single most difficult thing for me is still normal downward dog. The hip dips or other demanding movements and postures I've all been able to get into, but run me through downward dog a few times and I'm dying. The good news is I am slowly getting more comfortable and stable in the pose. It's taken a lot of me playing with it to get anything that felt right, and finally I gave up winging it and measured myself from palm to shoulder, shoulder to hip and hip to heel. A few sketches and some trig later, I realized I needed to start trying the pose with a much longer dog. My in sketched guess was too long (I'm 1.93 m tall and figured about 1.5 m from hands to feet), but I walked it back maybe 20 cm and the pose started making a lot more sense than it had before.

Adriene has been such a great teacher reminding me I don’t have to be an expert right off the bat, making me notice how I give myself a hard time for not stretching as far or holding a pose as long has really opened my eyes for more self love. “Lots of love in, lots of love out” has been a new go to mantra when I’m getting ahead of myself with that perfectionist kind of thinking.

I have ADHD, an anxiety disorder and chronic pain so some days are harder than others, BUT... This is longest I have stuck with practicing ANYTHING everyday.  If hitting day 15 of 15 wasn’t enough of a milestone for me today... when you said forearm plank and hip dips, my mind said “No no no, I can’t do these!”  I tried it anyway, and surprisingly I completed them with minimal shaking and without collapsing.  It was the first moment I realized how strong this challenge is making me.  I’ll take the strength that was revealed today into the next 15 days.

I am now 53 years old and have been having lotcs of health issues. I've been tested for MS, and luckily that was negative. I started tripping and falling. (Even once in front of my preschoolers that I teach) I have osteoarthritis everywhere! But hips, hands, neck and back are the worst. (Thank you cheerleading days...) Anyway, I didn't know what to do! So one day, my daughter reminded me of yoga and thought that there was no way I could balance again! But I just finished Day 15 Dedicate, and I'm feeling so much better. (some days the strength in my hips that's needed to hold up my core is not there, but I'm not going to stop) I do my Dedicate challenge in the mornings, and my daughter and I do your other videos at night.

My blue healer loves yoga too) and I got sick and had a terrible fall. Luckily my x-ray showed what I knew from the pain, degenerative disc disease and a little surprise—osteopenia. So yoga slows the progression of DDD and can reverse osteopenia. Today is my 45th day of consistent practice. The magic is happening and I am SO grateful!! Fewer, shorter episodes of pain, better sleep, regular feelings of joy, more energy, greater strength and even looser pants!! Thank you for sharing your practice.

533.0,"Man what an awesome practice. I got to about day 9 the first time through because I got really really sick. The second time through I wanted to start out from the top and now it's day 15. For the first time ever, I've made it this far without skipping one single day and boy am I proud of myself.


Today I looked at myself properly in the mirror for the first time in a while and was shocked at how much I'd changed (all in good ways!). I'm leaner but more than that, my face seems softer and more relaxed even on days that get me down like today. I have the skills to move with grace through bad days which I've been cultivating of late by showing up to do yoga even on bad days and working to find whatever inner smile I've got today. That grace allows me to get stuff done without grinding myself into the ground trying to make it happen. That makes me proud too.


Then there's the way that I feel. Sore, mostly! But I always feel better after my evening yoga session and day my day, old soreness has been going away for new ones. I remember the first week that my feet were killing me, then my shoulders. Now it's more my hips and knees. I can't say I'm excited for where I'll be sore next but I can say that I'm proud that even though we're still working our feet and our shoulders more than when we started, they hurt less. I notice the changes to how my body moves. I climb the stairs differently, my core is active when I walk, I keep my back straighter and my shoulder further down my back when I sit at work. When I bend over the sink to wash my face, my body automatically moves to a flat back instead of hunching over.


And of course today's practice brought all those little changes home. Taking us back through cornerstones of the practices thus far and letting us feel how much easier they are now and of course introducing the forearm planks with hip dips to keep us honest about the journey forwards. The core flow from tabletop was so tough the first couple of times we did it but it felt awesome today. The one for downwards dog took some effort but it was so much harder than ones I shook through in days past.


All of this in just 15 days. What a wonderful practice and way of encouraging us to reflect on ourselves. Thank you.",Ugyz_B2hebI15I8BVpx4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-02-20T04:18:09Z,0.49664629979771385

You and the programmes you develop truely have shown me how powerful yoga is in mastering all areas of living a beautiful life, in a way that no other classes have been able to yet; through understanding that its not about perfection, its about working with the body I have and the breath I have, you have really pushed me past what I thought I could do in yoga. 
Thank you so much for giving us all this beautiful gift and making it inclusive and accessible. I did your programmes at the start of last year and they helped me overcome trauma I was getting over at that time in a way nothing else could

Somehow going with these practice showing me that finding 20-30 min a day its completyly possible and I enjoy it very much.

I found your yoga the first morning of my ventures, having made a deeper commitment to be in practice even when I cannot get to a yoga class.  Am wondering why I hadn't found you before, because having these little practices as a single mom in the morning would have been so awesome.  Oh well - timing is what it is!  I am finding that I love your little bit sized yoga practices, allowing me to build strength and confidence...and your encouragement is so real and genuine and loving.

This is my first time committing to consistent yoga practice though I've been doing it on and off for the past year, but my physical therapist recommended I pick it up for my chronic back pain. After two weeks I'm already feeling much better on average with my pain, and also am noticing myself becoming stronger, more flexible, and just feeling more confidant in myself and my body in general. The confidence that yoga is giving me is also making me crave other physical activity, and giving me better performance in other activities because of the patience and self awareness that I feel I'm gaining through yoga practice. Super surprised to be this in love with it! I'm going on a road trip next week for the next month and something like that would normally interrupt my routines and break new good habits, but I'm already planning out ways that I can get my daily yoga in regardless of where I am.

They are pretty good quality, but Adriene has grown so much since then as a person and I would love to see another series of 3-5 practices made in the next 6-12 months.

I had multiple moments of release in these beginning days with some practices bringing me to tears.

I feel confident that I can continue committing myself to a daily yoga practice beyond this 30 day journey and have already found other healthy habits a lot easier to make since starting this. I can't thank you enough, Adriene! It's hard for me to connect with a lot of the yoga videos out there especially when some of the chosen attire is just too distracting if you know what I mean.

1391.0,"Halfway in, and still keeping up! Missing a few days here and there because life gets in the way -- but I've been excited to do a double session some days.

I've really been enjoying following along. So much so, that I've been inspired to upgrade my own fitness webapp project I'm developing to incorporate logging yoga activities. I'd be very excited to get you involved in the platform that it all operates on. I'm not sure if you've heard of it or not -- but it's running on an open-source blockchain called Steem, where content creators and content consumers are both rewarded (to varying degrees) for their social engagement.

Check out https://steem.io -- and specifically, the webapp / dApp (where the 'd' stands for 'decentralized') called dTube (https://d.tube) where users post, share, and consume videos similar to YouTube. The site I've slowly been developing (mostly, at this point, related to running and cycling) at https://xhaust.me.

I'm not certain if this is the best way to get a hold of you. If there's a better way to reach out -- please let me know. I don't often comment on YouTube -- so I'm not certain if there's a private-message type feature available, or if your email is listed somewhere.

If you're not overly interested -- that's fine too! I'll keep following along and try to bolster my home practice :)

I can’t express the horrible and graphic impact this has had on my life, but the truth is finally being revealed, and the board will issue sanctions against him!
I thank the universe for allowing me the closure that today brings and I thank everyone reading this for taking care of yourselves through yoga, as I’m taking care of myself. Namaste!

1617.0,"Just had an epiphany. I do marathon running and I learned years ago that if, at the beginning or start of the marathon, if my focus is on the finish line, I'll either never make it, or I'll finish but it will be a much harder run. When I do not focus on the result, on the ending, and live in the moment, that's when I made my record-setting runs for myself. One year I finished at 4hr30 min, and the next 3hr20min. I was wondering why I was able to commit to Yoga With Adriene moreso this year than others and I realized that Adriene has been teaching what I already do for marathons but have now come to realize, I need to do it in everything in life. The more focused you are on the moment, the richer the experience and better the result. If you are focused on result, you'll miss the details and vital lessons of the moment.

1729.0,"This is becoming a January tradition, so much new is revealed every year. Thanks to Adriene and team for creating and sharing it with everyone! One question. I wonder if I am the only one, but when we set intent at the beginning of a session, could there be 20 seconds without commentary? As much as I love many of Adriene´s messages, I sometimes feel there is a bit too much chat and it impacts my experience. I would be especially grateful for a few seconds of silence when we are asked to set an intent.  Do others feel the same/differently? I can always pause the video (which I do) but that is a wee bit disruptive.  Perhaps  all the talking is by design so I escape the noise? Would love to know how other people feel and from Yoga with Adriene if there is a method to the constant flow of commentary.  My favourite session last year was the one when we moved to music without any verbal guidance, but appreciate that we have to build up to that point!

So I've been doing this challenge (although I do keep up with a regular practice most of the time too) for the childrens charity Hope for Children, and its actually part of my training because i'm climbing to everest base camp in september!! If anyone would like to donate to me through the charity it would be such an honour, the link is here:

1748.0,Hey Adrienne.  I have been loving this journey so much and was so happy that it hadn't aggravated an old problem of mine until yesterday when I was on the mat and my right arm started to spasm and collapse in downward dog.  This has always been the reason that I've had to stop yoga in the past and I was devastated that it came back yesterday.  I stopped the video and then tried this practice today but with the same result.  I'm so sad to have to take a break in the journey.

Still have trouble with my shoulders though when I start to progress and then have to rest them. It seems that I can never progress. I used to do a lot of exercise and yoga years ago and was fine. I looked into inlinement , especially with  Chaturanga and have tried to make sure all is in line. I have had shoulder problems in the past as I am very flexible. When they start to hurt I take time to do your shoulder and neck yoga which really helps. Do you have any suggestions how I can move past this please?

Thank you Adirene, and thanks to everybody here. you give me so much strength <3",Ugx3lMmekxSoRzfPAgx4AaABAg,0.0,10.0,2019-01-16T06:27:38Z,0.995779275894165
