1.0,"Adrienne, in this video, when you have us move into warrior II, do we align our front heel with the middle of our back arch?  In a hot yoga class, I was told there is no time for adjusting the feet, and just leave them where they are.  My first few years of yoga where Hatha, so this feels a bit strange to me, though it doesn’t feel bad",Ugygy0w7pmh0Pw-YVPV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-12-12T18:25:47Z,-0.6635839939117432

4.0,"The lifting a baby image does work! I thought of a child asleep on its belly or in an awkward side position that needs to be moved to its bed.

10.0,"I am sooo proud of myself today. I've been sleeping for roughly 6 hours every day (8 used to be enough for me), just to fit in my practice, and it's been long since I had a longer sleep, so the tiredness I let go of every day with yoga now came and is demanding sleep, haha. I did my practice today, and was amused by practically acting like a zombie, not even knowing where the energy is coming from, but DOING IT. After whispering ""I am strong"", it became quite a lot better, though still tough. I am so proud of myself now, for finishing every day, even on the tough ones like this one. It is all worth it. I love it.❤️ If you're struggling some days, don't worry. You're not alone.❤️ Thank you Adriene, it would've been really hard to finish this practice without your encouragement and positivity, and without seeing Benji. Sending out love all across the globe to all the wonderful souls out there.❤️ Namaste.🙏",Ugw_7rzomBZypyGw4D14AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-06-10T04:47:29Z,0.9988129138946533

Also putting me on an emotional roller coaster at times. I looked forward to this 30 Day Yoga challenge because whenever I do these YWA challenges good things always come to me within that 30 Days along with personal growth. True to form those good things are happening for me. Although some days I procrastinate coming to the mat. It had already been a while since I had done Yoga because the stress of what changed threw me off and I stopped exercise and Yoga, all the things that manages my stress. So my body had to start over. Which was hard being out of shape and I was stressed, but I’m now 20 days in and feeling much more grounded and getting back in shape and stronger. Signs of what I’ve been hoping/praying for is finally showing, it’s just a lot of “do and wait and wait and see” happening right now.",UgwKNK35sKmGaiLPdb54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-22T06:20:45Z,0.982783317565918

I think some people assume softer, slower practices are easier or less challenging, but what I've come to realize is that constant movement like this absolutely flies by for me, no matter how hard it is, whereas slow moving practices force me to quiet, pay attention, and build endurance in a way that is incredibly counter to how many of us live our daily lives.

It's really been amazing to commit to this journey with all the magical people doing this. Today is when we take charge of and lead our practices through this gentle lower body burnout, to hopefully take this sense of leadership into our lives off the matt to ultimately control life, not letting it push us around. Way to commit to 2/3 of the journey. Let's finish strong for we do have what it takes, both of the mind and of the body. The first chapter of this year's book is almost done. Y'all are so strong.
