10.0,Don‚Äôt get me wrong this is extraordinary teaching but with all your experience I am surprised no one has commented on the one move you do in this class that is impossible for anyone with breasts. I simply cannot roll onto side in this way and it‚Äôs important for you to know because it hurts. It‚Äôs fine to include it for all those men and lucky women out there but a variation would be really helpful for the rest of us.

I am 55 yrs old and have been suffering from stiff joints for years.  I must now say, doing this 10 days have made me more flexible and the aches are almost nonexistent...well other than aches from core, butt and other muscles I have not used in decades probably.  I was recently walking 7 miles a day, 5-6 days a week but my poor feet were crying. I decreased the amount to 3-4 miles 4-5 days a week...now that I have implemented Yoga.  What a difference today makes say my feet and all of me. Lol.  This day was rather challenging for me though.  This morning as I got up at 5:30A to walk the dog a family of 6 raccoons were outside. They were looking at us like they were going to attack...made a loud almost pigeon sound...2 were heading towards us, I ran into the garage and somehow jammed my toe on the car tire.  It hurts but I was determined to do the class so I did what I could without adding more pain to it.  I am so grateful to God for you and my daughter.  Yoga is changing my life for best!!!

335.0,"Maybe someone will find this helpful or encouraging, so... I started this journey (it's my first experience with yoga) on Tuesday, just a week after the majority of you. During the first week I skipped Friday, because I was so exhausted I have fallen asleep on a couch and woke up early in the morning just to change my clothes and go to bed (I do these sessions in the evening). Next week I skipped Friday again and came back to practicing yoga only today (it's Wednesday). Usually, after skipping so many days I wouldn't have gotten back to it, but this time I did. I have never finished a challenge like this in my life, but I am determined to finish this one. I have fallen in love with yoga and with this channel and it amazes me how positively different I feel after this meditation-workauts. No matter how cliche it sounds, I am ready to change my life with daily yoga workouts. I'm not naive, I know I'll skip some workouts in the future, maybe even tomorrow, but as long as I find the strength to come back to this beautiful routine I am a winner. Every time I light up my candle and unroll the yoga mat self-love wins over indulgence.

Well  the lesson after today's practice is that sometimes (not all the time, maybe, though) when you feel like you want to roll up in a ball, expanding is exactly what you should try instead. I loved this flow - I feel like I'm loving each day more than the precedent, which is quite fun to see.
My mind wondered off in the last few minutes of the practice, but averall it felt really good to ground in sensations, breath and movement. I'm ready to start this day. It was daunting when I thought of it yesterday, but know I feel, no, I know that I am up to it. I can achieve anything. I have the power to change my life, my experience of life.

This is what i call the principle of paying yourself first in this game of mental psychology called life. The practice was on point today, i got inspired to draw a little chick that sat on my window frame while i was doing it. It is called paying yourself firrst both physically and emotionally. I've found a way to do this through yoga and observing nature as i've followed you over the past  4 years. Thank you for who you are  and what you do. Y'all are beautiful.
