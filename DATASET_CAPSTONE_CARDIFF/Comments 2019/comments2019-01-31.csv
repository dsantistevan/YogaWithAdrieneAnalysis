Thank you so much for being here.
Thank you for sharing your practice with me.
Way to show up!
Way to tell a story.
Way to go on the ride in a way that is honest, fun, conscious, and ever present.
It has been a total honor to be your yoga guide and even more of an honor to be your friend and fellow human in this process and on this journey.
Remember, it‚Äôs not the end.
It is most definitely the beginning.

Loved this last ""silent"" practice. I think Benji gets nervous when he doesn't hear your calm voice guiding us through. Perhaps that's why he stayed so close - leaning on you, and even sitting on you! He's the best companion to your yoga practices. I laugh, cry, grunt, strain and BREATHE! A million thanks.

As much as I love Adriene's instructed videos, day 30 is always a big thing for me, creating an opportunity to for me to make my own practice, which has always been a dream of mine. To move mindfully, on my own, being able to connect everything without guidance if I wanted to. I know I can do it. We all can. It's just about trust. In ourselves. Turning inward. I truly feel amazing after day 30. I love myself. I am creating my own little love cave, all around me. A life I want. One that I am in the lead of. As my own guide. Thank you, Adriene.

112.0,"I am writing this with a deep disappointment that drowns my heart at the moment.

I was looking forward to this last step of the journey for so long. It took way more than 30 days to complete this 30 day journey, so it would mean so much more to have a fulfilling end to this. Yet, with the decision to go ‚Äòmute‚Äô for the last day‚Äôs session, I was left with no guidance just because I can‚Äôt see. I rely on audio guidance to follow your routines because I can‚Äôt see without my glasses on. And today I sat on the mat with excitement and joy, just to realize I am robbed from the satisfaction of completing this journey. 

If you forget about me for a second, how are others with small screens supposed to follow those moves? Or people who have seeing disabilities? If there was a series with no verbal guidance, some people might choose to follow that one, maybe they prefer that. But I chose to follow this one from the beginning just to see it change fundamentally right at the end. 

I am very sad that it ended like this. I have absolute zero motivation to start a new journey. I feel betrayed and I feel the disappointment choking me down my throat.

This time, I actually WATCHED the video first, and recorded MY voice, guiding myself from posture to posture. And now I am going to DO it, listening to my recording and having the video to keep me company.

I felt it in a whole new way -- maybe because all the other days i don't WATCH you all that carefully, I mostly listen, and often close my eyes.

252.0,"I lost my partner earlier this year in May from cancer at the age of 33. The all-consuming nature of the grief has left me feeling very alien at times, and the pain of the heartbreak is often disassociative. How extraordinarily fortunate have I been then, amidst all of the sadness and despair, that a friend of mine led me to your channel and this Dedicate series in particular. So many of your lessons and the teaching that accompanies the movement have resonated with me in a way I never would have envisaged before my partner passed. The idea of coming back to your centre and always having your breath, the idea of owning and loving whatever moment you arrive in, that it is ok and that your journey is one of evolution and kindness to yourself and others. The idea that you have to show up for yourself to show up for others! I laid there at the end of today's practice quietly weeping, remembering where I was months ago, picturing my partner watching comfortably and pain free from afar with a smile on her face because she could see me smiling and strong. How beautiful that we all share on this journey together, through the pain and the doubt and the sadness it is so life-affirming to connect to the bigger picture and sit in the knowledge that there are people taking the journey with you, carrying an open heart and mind.

258.0,"I started doing yoga with adriene 100 days or so ago because quarantine was stressing me out, my chronic back pain, and I'm maybe the least flexible person in the world.  Her 30 days are nice easy chunks for me to stay motivated to do yoga every day and short enough they don't feel like too much of a commitment.
I have to admit, last week I had a bit of a breakdown.  When I started, I couldn't touch my toes (really even my ankles), reach my hands over my head,  or bend more than few inches forward when seated.  And last week it hit me, even though I've been at it for months I don't feel any closer to touching my toes, can't reach my hands over my head, can't bend, can't balance. Regularly I find myself completely unable to replicate a pose she gives no adjustments for (happy baby? more like me crying).  I felt like I'm doing everything wrong and so I decided I had to try harder.  On a straight-legged seat fold I pushed as hard as I could and heard a horrible pop. My neck and back went out again. I could hardly move the next day.  Since I'd started yoga my pain had been much better, but suddenly even that was gone.
I realized that I'm doing the best I can, progress will come if it does, and I am slowly at least getting stronger.  Maybe I'll never touch my toes or have my heels down in downward dog. There are worst things in life.",UgyoF4DPew6WAptxDqx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-08-17T22:33:38Z,-0.990031361579895

It was too difficult to have to keep looking at the screen constantly and having to anticipate how long you/we should be in a certain pose. So, I stopped the video after about 5 minutes and ended up switching over to your Revolution 30 day series. How many of these different 30-day series do you have, and how do they differ? Revolution will be the third of your 30-day series for me. Again, if you're keeping score, I love your videos where your talking us through it far, far more than the ones you have with either no talking or voice-over while you're silently doing the poses.

For a long time, I have tried to do things out of self-love but recently realized I have been doing these things because of self-hate. Diets and exercise regimens that I fail time and time again, knowing none of them are realistic or practical for life change. Yoga has been my saving grace. And with the pandemic my goal of joining a class had been thwarted. I randomly looked for yoga on YouTube and found you. I started with a 30 day practice from 2015 and was hooked. I hope you know how much your positivity and promotion of self love is a gift. Thank you for it all.

Yoga really does feel like home. And with dedicate, I was able to continue what I started and stick to it, so I implemented the title of the journey into my practice again. the first time I reached the 30th day with Home, I was definitely more nervous to see that there was more audio. With the end of this journey, I still attempted to follow along, but it was more natural for me. I didn't worry so much about having to follow along perfectly and the practice felt like it was my own and I was in control. I always love coming in the comment section and treating it like a little journal for my progress. It's great to see how other people integrate the practice too. I think I'll dedicate some time to going back and reviewing some of the lessons each day gave me.

357.0,"I didn't think or feel like I would make it this far, but here I am, and I'm so proud of myself! This is now my 2nd YWA 30 day this year (started 13 April) and I'm so happy and grateful for Adriene and this opportunity to practise. 
The world is mostly a sh!tshow right now, but this yoga practice is really helping me focus on being more mindful, letting go of what I can't control, and doing the good work wherever I can, because now that I have a yoga practice, I have so much more energy!
So, this is me, with a whole lot of üåªüåªüåªüåªüåªüåª for you all, in honour of the upcoming solstice (happy Litha y'all) and also international Yoga Day on Saturday! Hope to see you all on Adriene's livestream.

419.0,"Adriene, I am over a year later than almost everyone here and I don't know if you'll read this, but I really wanted to say a couple of things.

You have been so inspirational throughout this entire journey, and have helped me love my body and take care of it, even OUT of practice time. Everyday I notice that I sit a little straighter at my desk, I'm more mindful of my movements, I observe my breaths...
I've been reading all these comments about people feeling more loved and connecting to themselves and randomly crying during yoga, but for the most time I felt like it wasn't working, and I was doing something wrong.
But in the last few days I realized I was wrong. I have improved so much, and I am so proud of myself for going on this journey, even if it was difficult, even if I missed two days. Honestly, the first time I've ever cried and felt like I really loved myself was Day Eight, Meditate. But then that feeling started to fade again, until now. You have helped me stay so connected to myself and my body, and I am so grateful.
I loved today's practice as well, I really enjoyed the fact that the mic was off, and I think I connected to myself better (even though I did peek at you!) and I really enjoyed everything overall.

One last thing:
Usually I don't say 'Namaste' or do that because I didn't really resonate with it and I felt pretty alone anyway. But you know what? I cried when this was over. And today, for the first time, I said 'Namaste' to you and to everyone who has done this, and I meant it. I really did.

Thank you so much, for everything <3",Ugw9NvLH6SEXcEaZdlR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-05-22T14:04:38Z,0.9990442395210266

Love being guided by you to connect with my body & spirit while also having some giggles and flashbacks from you busting into song all at once.

My partner Paula and I Just finished the course yesterday. And thank you for everything. We are in Mumbai in a complete lock down. Life right now is full on anxiety and stress. Lot of work is happening despite the lock down and  at the same time you have to deal with the hot indian summer. The difference between a day and a night was  getting blurred for a few days.  You and this course is what kept us going so strong. You made us fall in love with what we have. Paula is from Vancouver and I am from Pune so we both have been heavily exposed to Yoga in our own way. She was exposed to it in a very Vancouver Hipster way and I have been exposed to it as I went to a school where it was part of our Physical Training exams. Many Indian schools make it compulsory.  But when you don't get introduced to yoga in a right way you never like it. We didn't like it much either. But these 30 days we practised it with you for ourselves. Not because its a trend or not because it's compulsory in the school. And oh boy wasn't it a completely different experience. Thank you for guiding us so seamlessly and making it feel effortless.  Will continue to take your guidance. And will continue practicing. Lots of love and Light.",UgwVua4AVv1ftPDARel4AaABAg,2.0,70.0,2020-04-29T06:31:47Z,0.9993201494216919

I thank you for this experience, and bow my head to you and the gift you have given me and so many others. I realize endings are hard for me because I've been through more than I've wanted.

What a lovely, generous thing you've done. Reading these comments relaxed the skin of my forehead and I stopped clenching my jaw. It is an incredible gift you've cultivated and shared with so many. 

See how much, how many you've helped!!! 

Myself included. I hope you feel every shade of that grace.

After I started to see a therapist for the first time, I began slowly identifying some significant experiences that shaped my life, my mind, my body. She noticed I was holding my breath a lot, so I did a couple of days of short breathing practice and found your YouTube channel after investing in a yoga mat and some sweet pants. I hoped I could go a little deeper with some mind-body connections. I had some early damage to my psycho-spiritual sacrum.

The yoga practice I built for myself just wouldn't have happened without you. It was so immediately, immensely helpful to have a guide who would speak to my own specific concerns - uniting right and left, sun and moon, masculine and feminine, mind and body. Finding the source of 20 years of mind-body disassociation was intense for me, and related to an experience I had on the early internet with a pedophilic predator. How fitting that an altogether different teacher on the internet would help me process the way this had affected me for so long.

I made it through your Dedicate 30-day yoga journey after some basic instruction videos. Along the way, I went to a couple of group classes locally, feeling way more confident than I would have if I had gone in cold. I'm now about 5 days out from the end, and find a new video each day in your channel for that day's yoga practice. I wake up, every day, looking forward to the time I get to spend working toward a united mind and body, heart and soul. I used to feel so separate from my body. Thank you for helping me live more joyfully, and with a wholeness I've not had for a very, very long time.",UgxjzW0N_2aQod-pRRB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-12-27T17:31:26Z,0.9982210993766785

I just finished this series.... at one point I got carried away and started ripping off multiple practices per day.

There were times when I would do my own thing and times when I would open my eyes and see Adriene and think ""that looks like it would feel good"" and join in.

And even when I was doing my own thing, I'd hear Adriene guiding me the whole way, ""inhale halfway lift, exhale forward fold"", or telling me to do goofy things like kiss my knees as I gave myself a hug. I can't believe 30 days are over and I felt so emotional when I joined her at the end to say namaste.

683.0,"Hello Yoga with Adriana community, This is my second time going through this 30 days of yoga journey. It was transformative each time I choice this for myself and stick to it. I absolutely love the support I get from showing up for myself everyday from adriene community AND ADRIENE HERSELF. I've been a participate of this yoga channel for the last three years. Going through this particular 30 days of yoga the first time earlier this year, I had a shift inn my life where I saw the toxic parts around me and I ended up deciding to move out on day 29. That changed me for the better and I thank you for that. Committing to 30 days of Yoga, a second time this summer,I learned to open my heart and leave behind hurt and personal defeat in the different sessions. At the beginning of the journey, I wondered how this would befit me and my soul? How This would once again help me shift; And once again on day 29, I found out I am pregnant! Crazy, unexpected But in my heart, in my body, and in my soul I felt ready and prepared and I can thank you all for this. Adriene, you are a heaven sent, even if you do not believe in such a thing. Thank you for being there for me and taking care of not only people's physical health but their mental health as well. You're videos have saved me not only from myself but the dangers and hurt from the world. Spread all the love guys, The people who are ready to receive it will!

At some points I followed, some others I did what I felt like doing. It was funny  that sometimes, while doing my own thing, I turned and there you were, doing the same thing! It happened during the first halfway lift, the same exact second, and then at some point I said ""I'm tired, instead of another vyn I'll just go a bit in child's pose"" and after a bit I turn and you were in child's pose too!

I could hear your voice in my head during this but faltered a little in trusting in my body to do things right so I'm hopping over to start True. Yoga is something I see myself continuing for the foreseeable future. (Never imagined I'd be saying this!) I even yoga'd outside during an amazing thunderstorm last night!?! Your gentle, encouraging style of teaching is perfect & translates into my everyday movements and breathing. What a beautiful person you are.

766.0,"I was in a car horrific car accident two years ago and have PTSD because of the incident and am now partially disabled. My body hurt all the time, I was constantly nauseous, had migraines, it made me lay in bed all day. I felt like I had no control over my body, I was depressed, I was in so much pain, physically and emotionally. Dedicating this time to my health and healing has made such a drastic change in both my physical and emotional trauma. I no longer lay in bed all the time, I wake up early and excited to eat breakfast and do yoga. I truly believed that my pain would be unmanageable, but yoga has given me such a wonderful gift. The physical healing has been a catalyst for healing my emotional trauma. Today as we began in meditation I just began to cry, I am so much stronger than I was 30 days ago, I am so much stronger than I was 2 years ago. Thank you Adriene, you are truly a blessing. Before this I had closed myself off in fear of getting hurt, you have shown me to be kind and gentle to myself. I will spread your positive mission from here on out and take yoga on my journey. -Jacquelin, 22, Oregon",UgxNU2v6sz6eAlbKZV14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-07-24T18:26:18Z,0.9978308081626892

It‚Äôs dark in the tunnel and yet I can see
a light at the end far away from me. 


The light changes shape from year to year 
always adapting to my innermost fear. 


The fear of being away from home
the light looking quite like my brother Jerome


The fear of being stuck in the city 
a countryside house made of light ‚Äì look how pretty!


The fear of not ever being enough
an image of me looking skinny and tough

Everytime one fear is out of the way 
another one creeps in and threatens to stay

Then one day I learned to breathe properly 
and suddenly I could clearly see
the light at the end of the tunnel was me.",UgxHLwGvmERATE831194AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-07-21T20:15:27Z,0.9921547770500183

But at the end when I saw the Dedicate logo I felt so proud that I did all this progress. When I did Truth/True (can't remember the name exactly) last year, at first it seemed like a big challenge to do 30 days! And I skipped some days also....


But this year was a piece of cake!!! I only skipped one day (and I'm not even sure it counts bc, on the other hand,  I did Day 0 and day 1 in a day, so :DDD). Yoga feels sooo good!!!

For honouring the tradition and principles of Hatha Yoga
For your warmth and unending encouragement that went such along way on those lesser days...
And for your informative well- Pedagogically structured lesson with the emphasis on
Where you would be taking us?
What you wanted to share and for us  to experience in any given moment 
How that experience relates to us? And the practise we are in the process of establishing..

As a former Trainer and having my beginnings with Yoga back in the 70's 
Many things and interpretations have since changed.  Thank you for the mission 
You set out with Yoga with Adriene - truly "" Mission Accomplished"" 
Today I cried as I listened to your humbling speech and as we moved in time together and I could use all the tools that I'd gathered 
throughout our journey together - that my beloved is the power you and your mission encompass as I'm sat here on the other side of the world 
And you were probably asleep but part of you was present and I thank you xxxx

My biggest issue is my mind races and I become full of anxiety when I just try to sit in silence. So when I meditate I use a guide (even when I'm not really listening it seriously helps) and I have been doing your yoga videos for a few months because your chatting keeps me calm and in the moment and able to finish a practice with a sense of peace. Today, I was anxious the whole time. I kept thinking about stuff I didn't want to and I couldn't stop no matter how hard I tried. But I was able to do 40 minutes of yoga on my own which is amazing. I have gotten so much better at finding what feels good since starting this series. No more ""what pose should I do next moment?"" I just follow through. So I see my big obstacle that I need to work on next, and I've gained serious footing these last 30 days. I think I'm going to start the series all over again and see how I improve in the next 30 days. Thank you Adriene.

940.0,"Thank you so much for another wonderful series. I've been using your 30 programs pretty much daily, since July 2017, which means you have gifted me a regular yoga practice. What a gift! Deep gratitude to you. One piece of feedback; it would be encouraging if instead of suggesting we use a lift if we needed to, you sat on a block/book/blanket when in easy posture or whatever pose, all the time. There is something about the authority of the teacher that suggests we copy what you are doing, even when given explicit verbal permission to 'do what feels good'. I feel that if you consistently took the adaptations, the support, the 'kinder' way, it would spread even more kindness in the world. I'd be interested to read your take on this.

Took this opportunity to sum up this yoga program. At the start of this journey, I fell lost both physically and mentally, so I started this practice on the ground remembering why I took this time for myself. Then as the journey went on, I could feel more and more like I could open my heart a little bit more to myself as I transitioned to sitting poses. At the end of this journey, it became easier to open my heart to beloved ones and praise everything that life brings us everyday as I finished this practice with graceful standing poses.

This is great and will definitely recommend this program to all those who wish to get started in yoga, but they don't know where to start.

But this practice made me realise so many things : 
- even without Adriene's voice this class was sososoooo beautiful (loved the music!) 
- the moment I got into the flow my whole body just started dancing 
- I was able to do things I thought I couldn't (like headstand after a long time) 
- I know that I'm strong 
- I was able to relax so wonderfully that even the hammering outside the window sounded like music to me üòÇ
- life is magical and exciting ‚ú®

1131.0,"Dear Adriene, I cried at the end... This last episode felt sooo good! I was little worried at the beginning as there is no speaking but you know what? I've learned so much through this journey so I just listened to my body and it was the best decision - all was well and I enjoyed a lot. This journey means a lot to me - this is my last day and I can't believe I am saying that. This is the FIRST programme that I finish in my entire life. This fits me more than well because I know my higher self and the Universe sent me this in the right time. I can't even describe what are my feelings, what I have learned ,what my body, my soul together with my mind told me/showed me/inspired me. As said earlier, I am a mom to triplets. They turn 1 in 3 days, I turned 30 last November, this 30-day programme I finished in over 2 moths. I am still brestfeeding my children, we take long walks twice a day and the time spent together is the best time in my life. I feel like this whole year with them was the first year in my life when I lived fully, gracefully, I felt Universe above me more than ever and I've learned so much. My heart is full and happy and this programme perfectly fits into this conscious-mind-opening year. My love is what keeps me going even though I took 2 pairs of antibiotics and took some time off, I knew there will be a day when I will write this post. You are a wonderful teacher, you are a great person. I can't describe what I feel towards you because, again, it is so complex but I am not far from thruth if I say ""love"". 


I feel better mom, better woman, better being. Not better, but ME again with all gifts the Universe gave me. I feel great thanks to you. 


All moms out there - you are great, you are love!

1132.0,"My goal was to do 60 days of exercise, but I was cautious on what I chose to do since I was ana- and ortho- rexic for many years. I'm completely recovered, but doing something everyday sometimes taps into my unhealthy mindset. I decided to see if there was a 30 day yoga series and found Dedicate. :) 

When today's practice started, I wondered how it would go without coaching. But then I realized it was really cool to be able to think ""I can guide a practice on my own!"" Half-way through Dedicate, I was able to do puppy pose, and forearm plank without clasping my hands - without doing which usually irritates my forearms weirdly. And today!! I didn't flop down going ""slowly"" from plank to cobra-set-up!!! I've never ever not had to flop the last few inches! :D I was so excited!

At one point, a voice in my head said, ""Re-do that. You weren't holding the muscles you were supposed to. You tensed there and could hurt this.."" which all sounds good, but as I started trying to redo it correctly,  I got in this not so good loop. Then I remembered all the times you said, ""And if you're doing this, that's okay, too."" and I stopped myself, so thank you for that gentle guidance and reminders you incorporate into every video. :)

I also loved loved the background music! So pretty and inspiring! Thank you for this journey, Adriene! I plan on doing last year's 30 days next. See you and Benji there. :)",UgzZok2VaNW32kFRiAx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-04-01T20:37:11Z,0.982071578502655

In the in-betweens, I've been coming back to this challenge, determined to finish and give my body the extra love it needs right now. By the end of this video, I was left thinking of all of the good things so far this year: getting hired permanently at my job after being a temp for over a year and a half, getting my health exemption in the mail and being able to do my taxes without owing money, starting to look for a house to call my own, and nurturing relationships with those I love and watching those relationships grow and flourish. My practice ended with my cat, Weasley, putting his paw on my face during savasana, making me laugh. I couldn't have ended this journey on a better, more positive note.

1180.0,"Just finished my 30 day yoga journey (only a few months late but life gets in the way sometimes) and I feel amazing. This practice made me think about when I did day 30 of True last year, it was my first ever unguided practice and I was anxious and tense the whole time as I was fairly new to yoga. But after this last half an hour of listening to my body, calling on all I have learned over this last year - and peaking at my laptop every now and again when I got stuck - I had a real moment of reflection about how much good yoga has done for me. Every time I find a spare moment to get on the mat I feel myself getting stronger in mind and in body. I have this channel and this community to thank for that (and myself for getting on the mat). I don't usually leave comments but I do read a fair few and this is such a positive corner of youtube that I'm so grateful to have found. Thank you Adriene!

I just completed the day 30 today and there have been so many days that I wanted to reach out and let you know how much I appreciate what you do. I generally don't write comments but I really felt that I needed to express my gratitude. Before this program, I use to get into programs super hard needing it to be perfect and extreme. And when I couldn't do it perfect or it became too hard I would give up. Your 30 day dedication was completely different and exactly what I needed but didn't know it. At first it was an adjustment, not going balls to the wall or demanding perfection from myself. It was beautiful, I learned to accept myself where I'm at, seriously not pushing myself to look a certain way or force my body into a position it wasn't ready for. Thank you so much.

 I spent some time cat cow, and some time doing salutations, and basically in a ball on the floor looking inwards.
 I did some baby pulses, and a few twists, in no particular order and I forgave myself for not being the strongest, the best balanced, and found some really basic stretches which felt nice which was basically laying down, legs up, toes pointed. That made the rest of my body really relax.
I then sat up straight in prayer pose, I sent love to drivers who piss me off when I'm on the road, I sent love to so many who frustrate me like my ex, I sent love and gratitude to everything and everyone, just sending warm light love outwards.
Then, I felt forgiveness, I felt forgiveness from my friend who took her own life and I've felt blamed.
I felt her put light over me, she is still my friend watching over me.

1242.0,"So, I'm 6 weeks late but I did it! I have to admit, when we started this journey I HATED downward dog because it always hurt my wrists. But, as you pointed out early on that we would need to build the muscles up. Well, I believe that has happened. Along with learning that ""clawing through the fingers"" really helps. I've come to really like this pose, now. I loved the music and even though I was a little worried about following along, I felt that most of the time I seemed to understand what was going to happen next. It also gave me a sense of relief when I saw you have to reset on the pose where we hold the foot back and stretch the other arm out. As we were doing it on the first leg, I was still struggling with balance. I've always felt that I had good balance but as I struggled with this pose suddenly felt ""older"" at not being able to be steady. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw you reset so backed it up and sure enough, you did. It made me realize that even the yoga teacher can lose her balance, maybe it wasn't just me.

I participated in Dedicate through all of January until Day 29 & 30 when I fell on a run and busted up both my knees.  I finally finished earlier this week, the fastest (even with an injury) I‚Äôve ever finished a 30 Day yoga practice!  The Dedicate Journey has meant so much to me and I cried the happiest of tears as I flowed with Adriene through Day 30.

But, the real reason I am commenting is to give ALL the snaps to the creative team and filming crew who put this together, specifically Day 30.  I almost wanted to stop and watch as the sunset behind Adriene through those gorgeous windows timed perfectly with the practice!  You only get one chance at that, and it was BREATHTAKING!

So this time I thought, what's there to lose? And went for it. I can't explain fully how I feel, but about half way through I realised I was strong enough and capable enough to do this. I don't feel like I've ever embodied the poses as well as today and there was something so empowering knowing I have all the tools I need to take care of myself.
It goes beyond the mat and the yoga, it feels much bigger then that and I thank you for giving me these tools and also the moment in time to realise I had them all the time.",Ugz07pDdIBQHxNwnynp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-17T12:23:50Z,0.9971674084663391

1250.0,"I started Dedicate just after finishing the 30 days of yoga challenge. After the 30 days not a lot had changed. I still was a little grumpy thinking about having to get on the mat and move my body. I didn‚Äôt really feel relieved or content or satisfied after the practice. But throughout Dedicate that all changed. I now look forward to yoga, the practice takes my mind off of things and helps me relax. Oftentimes I start crying during practices but it‚Äôs a good kind of crying, a release of pent up emotions. Taking antidepressants has made it a little hard to release frustration or sadness but yoga has helped me to jump over that barricade. A few days ago my mom joined me during one of my practices and she couldn‚Äôt sit still and just listen to your voice for a few minutes while I thouroughly enjoyed the meditation. I suddenly realised that I had managed to access a certain inner calmness I didn‚Äôt have before. I cannot thank you enough for providing these videos on here.

1291.0,Thank you so much for these 30 days Adriene. I really didn't realize how much i needed this until this last day. I guess i had some pint up emotion I wasn't aware of because this practice made me cry a lot. I cried when i was finally able to do the tree pose without stumbling and i cried even harder at the end (i guess from gratitude...I'm not sure.) You're an amazing instructor.

1297.0,"I started this 30 day yoga journey at the beginning of a new quarter in school, and it has helped me in so many ways. Medical school has been so challenging with so much information coming at you so fast and there's a lot pressure to perform well on multiple exams every week. There's virtually no time to wind down, but this 30 day series has forced me to set aside time every day for myself to de-stress and come back to my body. This last day was quite an emotional release. Like opening a pressure valve, I was able to feel everything I've been putting aside for the sake of survival. Thank you, Adrienne, for your amazing guidance and quirky sense of humor! I will keep coming back to your videos; I love your genuine personality.

1298.0,"Quotes that resonated throughout the journey:
Day 1 Discern: ""Notice your transitions, they are the most important.""
Day 3 Observe: ""You are both the observed and the observer.""
Day 8 Meditate: ""All you can control is your movements, which control how you feel.""
Day 9 Divine: ""The divine presence in me recognizes the divine presence in you.""
Day 11 Courage: ""May we always have the courage to see the truth.""
Day 12 Curate: ""You are ultimately responsible for your own happiness.""
Day 14 Grace: ""Grace is different for each of us, different day to day."" 
Day 16 Dulce: ""How you treat yourself is going to influence or dictate how you treat others.""
Day 23 Joyful: ""Part of finding the joy for me is giving myself permission to participate and engage in activities and practices that support me being me. Authentically me, so I'm not wearing a disguise or hiding- but I'm putting myself in situations where I can safely explore who I am. So that I can get strong and be steady within that.

Today I flowed with all the knowledge I have learned in the past year and a half of practice. It is such a gift, and I got a little choked up to realize I can do it all by myself! I have the patience and strength to lead me! It is a blessing and I am happy to say now I can truly practice this patience and kindness moving forward as I go into the world. Thank you Adriene and all of the other amazing people who also made this possible. It is an amazing gift. You've changed my life.

1383.0,"Okay so I didn't want to write a comment because I wrote one last year but this was absolutely amazing. I have some points on this practice. 
1.) I started out so excited. I remember last year I was so teriffied but this year it was like I was a kid waiting for candy. 
2.) This one might sound crazy, but everytime I closed my eyes I could see myself doing the shape, even when I was moving I could see it. 

3.) Just came from work, it's like 9 pm and I have no idea why, but I just did hip-dips. I think I'm going crazy!
4.) Almost forgot this one. When the TRUE song came up I was in a tree pose and I started to smile. I never felt more alive. 
5.) I actually cried at the end of the practice. And actually sychronized with Adriene towards the end which was so cool. 
So thank you Adriene from the bottom of my heart for once again pushing my limits, for encouraging and guiding me throughout this journey. And even though I was angry and frustreted at times and I started out later I am very VERY glad that I got to cross the finish line with you! Thank you.

I started in the middle of January, but since I travel almost weekly, on Thursday I do the day 30 of True, still not perfect and on Fridays I do the Total Body Yoga - Deep Stretch.  On Thursdays I am going to switch between this day 30 and the True Day 30.


Adriene, I know others thank you ,but I can tell you that in Nov 2017 I had some cardiac issues, between your programs, some acupuncture (you were recommended by the acupuncturist) and some nutrients from my Chiropractor/Nutritionist I am doing a lot better.  I cannot express how grateful I am for you programs.

1423.0,"I started this series on 2/1/2019 and just finished a few minutes ago on 3/2/2019.  I wanted to be healthier and even lose weight this year, but I needed a form of exercise that wouldn't be to hard on my joints and something I actually wouldn't mind waking up and doing everyday.  For January, I just switched between hip-hop tabata and novice yoga (mostly just corework and spinal balance), then I came across this 30-day challenge.  It was the only one I could actually afford--a LOT of 30-day yoga subscriptions are advertised on social media, and plus I wanted to see if yoga was right for me.


As it turns out, it very much was.  During this journey, there were a few things in particular I learned about myself and my practice.


1) It turns out I was more familiar with a lot of the poses than I thought, especially cobbler's pose (butterfly), planks, etc.  


2) I absolutely need to get a new yoga mat.  The one I had was a little too slippery, but I bought it three years ago and barely used it, so I had no idea until now.  I think I'll get a cork one.


3) I'm a teacher, which requires me to talk a *lot*, but it wasn't until I started this journey that I realized how little and shallow I was actually breathing in my daily life.  I became much more conscious of that.  Remembering to breathe actually got me through a few stressful times this month, especially during my voice acting audition.


4) While I didn't lose as much weight, there were other major changes my body went through.  I found that I was sleeping better without supplements, and my metabolism and digestioni had *much* improved.


However--and admittedly--there were a couple days during the month I wasn't sure I'd complete all 30 days.  Those were the times when I had to skip on a session and simply double up the next day, or simply do a short practice on my own due to schedule constraints.  Even yesterday--which would be day 29--completing day 30 felt like a long shot.  Maybe because I wasn't sure I'd feel like doing it today.  Maybe because I was the only one within my immediate circle going on this journey.  But I didn't feel I had to keep going--I simply *wanted* to.  As someone who hadn't done yoga since 3rd Grade gym class, that was a huge step for me.


So I finished Day 30.  I didn't land all the poses (such as tree, stepping through from downward dog or ninja), but I got most of the flow down.  Even though there were no oral instructions, this video felt like a practical final exam, an amalgamation of all I had learned, with the music being my guide.  I was pleasantly surprised how easy each movement came to me. 


By the cooldown, especially when the complete Dedicate theme song, started playing, I was tearing up.  It was the perfect reprise, and a reminder that I, on my own, got up at 4 or 5 in the morning and did this practice for a whole month. Not because anyone told me to, but I chose to take care of myself.  This is something I had neglected for such a long time, especially since living in Tokyo for the past six years.  By the time the video ended, I was in complete tears, finally succumbing to my simultaneous pride and humility.  When I finally stopped crying, I simply told myself, ""I did it.  I actually did it.""


I'm going to continue on to your Weight Loss series and other videos, but I want say thank you *so* much for your guidance and I wish you the best of luck in your journey as well.  Namaste.",Ugw7Ag-oSGeLuYYnNHt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-01T23:31:41Z,-0.4326567581901819

1428.0,"Thank you so much for this Adriene. This is my first time commenting, but I just wanted to say how grateful I am for your warm energy, guidance, and dedication. This 30 day programme has helped me become productive again, and stopped me from closing in on myself through this cold February. Mentally, this programme has been a true gem. On the physical side it was something incredibly powerful; starting yoga properly guided me towards a new PB at the Shizuoka Marathon which I ran on day 25 (started late!). 
From now on I will keep clicking your videos as out of all of the teachers in the world, I love your warm humour and gentle guidance the most. When this final practice ended I genuinely gasped and cried ""oh no it's over!"". The 30 days went by in a flash. Each practice went by in a flash. Today's practice particularly went by in a flash.
The Dedicate journey may be over, but a new yoga journey is beginning! I hope to stick with your practices as I embark on a job hunt while on my year abroad in Japan. I feel that yoga cleanses the mind and each practice has left me buzzing with the feeling that anything is possible. You've helped me already in so many ways.

Yoga with you turned out to be the little pauses between the healing. The healing came through the counseling, meds and connecting with friends and family.

Thank you So much Adrienne for this amazing journey. It has been beneficial to me in so many ways. These 30 sessions were perfect. You‚Äôve allowed me to cry when I needed to cry, laugh when I needed to laugh, rest when I needed to and you pushed me hard enough so I could grow. You released me of tensions and emotions i wasn‚Äôt aware I was carrying. I feel so much stronger mentally and emotionally as well as physically. Some days were easy but some were hard and sometimes I didn‚Äôt feel like showing up but in the end I was always happy I did.
From my heart to yours, an overload of love and gratitude.

I dislocated it years ago doing yoga with no matter and slippery socks my own foolish mistake and the doctors basically told me I'm stuck with this dislocated tailbone and can't do anything about it.

Thank you so much for sharing yourself and yoga with all of us and building such a community. I discovered your videos two years ago this time of year, during my visitations to graduate schools. Your videos helped me through choosing a graduate school, moving all the way across the country, the transition of my new life, the break up with my long-term partner, and now they've seen me through to my second year of graduate school and all of its stresses. You always make me laugh. And you teach me to be kind to myself, something with which I've always struggled. And I know yoga has helped me gain confidence too, something else with which I've always struggled. And I read the comments on your videos and think of how many lives you've changed. You are truly a blessing to this world. Thank you so much.  P.S. I was so proud of myself because I didn't look at the video today and I did my own poses the entire time!

The motions I took were my demands, not someone else's which I can be sometimes disturbingly used to and even dependent on. The wordless practice made my mind so peaceful in ways it hadn't been before in a yoga practice. This truly was liberating and empowering! I hope to be just as great as a yoga guide in the future as this should be the ultimate mission of yoga. Namaste c:",Ugw7V9A1p0H5VvRENO54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-02-16T21:28:47Z,0.9990513920783997

1710.0,"I've finished this beautiful journey 4 days ago. What can I say...Going on this journey truly was the best choice I could make. I started out a little later but it still was the very beginning of a new year and I'm truly greatful for the opportunity. I've faced different things throughout the practices. In the beginning I had almost no balance and was yawning like never before. Not because I was bored or tired or something but because I actually could breathe deeply and well for the first time in many years. My heart was racing through the first 10 or so practices and I couldn't control my breath but things got much better later. I can't even say when but at some point I started noticing that my clumsy flow started being...what???...somewhat graceful. And. I. L O V E D. It.
I've gained balance and strength. I've found my posture (actually started feeling when my spine feels wrong. Now it always wants to be in the lovely ""head over heart, heart over pelvis"" position.)

The most important - I just feel better now. Awake and stable. Stability is the main thing I've been always trying to find. And now I feel it more and more and accept the possibility of going off track sometimes but I guess...I'll always be able to find myself again somewhere in the Quiet Mountain.

Thank you Adriene for what you do for the global community of living souls. I'm sending you a hug full of light and love from Siberia. Thank you. I'll keep on going forward with your wonderful videos. Take care. ‚ô°",UgyYb78Wyd274bbShP94AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-02-13T05:53:32Z,0.9989117383956909

Adriene makes you feel good for just being there and acknowledges how difficult it is to commit some time everyday to yoga, but she makes it totally worthwhile.
This last session was fantastic bringing together everything from the past month.  My only critism is it's really difficult to follow without Adriene's voice guiding you.  You keep having to look up and check what she's doing - which means I'm sure I wasn't doing some poses correctly.

I then set out to find a new yoga video. That is when I found Yoga with Adriene.

1837.0,"Adrienne, 
So I've been watching you for awhile now and I feel that after completing two of your 30 day yoga programs, I feel it's time to address my experience. I love so many things about your sessions. I love how you talk us through each move and show us how to breathe. I love how you apply everything on the mat to everything off the mat. I really loved dedicating my mornings to yoga with you. I thank you for your commitment as well. 

Now, I have to take a moment to request two things. If I had my way, you would make each session a little bit longer. I really love what you do and what you are helping me do for myself. I would love it if you could shoot for a minimum of 30 minutes. What I normally do: Each morning, I start on my own and warm myself up, then I hit play and do your video with you. However, I always have another one of your previous videos ready in another tab so that I can switch to it after the first one finishes. That way I could have more time for myself and if I still needed or wanted more, I would continue as your video ends. I LOVE IT!

The second request is that you would make a 365 Day Series. I would just love to flow with you and find what feels good for an entire year. I feel like dedicating myself with one teacher could really allow me to dive deeper and deeper into consciousness and create a lasso with  your energy. I love how far I've come and now that the 30 days are over....I find myself wanting more! It was so easy to just click on the next day and know that there would be continuity and consistency in what we had done in the previous sessions. 

I really want to thank you for dedicating your time and energy to us all around the globe. The divinity in me recognizes the divinity in you. Namaste.

P.S. I cried with you, too!",UgwIJLG7r7xCpSTC0yh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-02-08T22:14:27Z,0.9983664155006409

1845.0,"Thank you, Adriene, for another great series and for being the best teacher I could've found. Last year I finally got into yoga thanks to your videos, and I've been practicing with you almost daily since TRUE. It has made me feel so much stronger and more confident, and more than that. Your calm and positive attitude is so amazing that you've become my inner yoga voice, I carry you around in my head everywhere off the mat. I'm not into mantras, but I love your quotes. Several times a day I randomly remember to find the length in the front and ground in the back, take the deepest, loving breath I've taken all day, to relax my shoulders and lift the corners of my mouth... and it always makes me smile. You taught me how to be mindful and kinder to myself as well as others - without even trying!

I've missed a few days of this series due to not having time or energy and ended up finishing a full week later, but I don't mind at all, because even a day later, every single practice was still exactly what I needed that day! I swear you're a magician. Or maybe I'm just exactly where I need to be.

And it's so very fitting that I did this last practice today, as I'm at a strange place in my life right now. I've just finished watching the last series of my favorite show. I'm losing my job and have no idea where I'll work next. Even my relationship is kind of falling apart... It all added up and I've started this year feeling like my whole life is going to end in a few months. But then I realized I'm looking at it all wrong. Every end is also a beginning. Life goes on. I'm going to find a new job, family issues will work out one way or another, broken things can be replaced by new, better ones and I'll find a new show to watch. Tomorrow I'll start another one of your 30 day yoga journeys and everything will be right with the world.

I started a couple of days late and missed two or three along the way but I carried on and finished:) This is only the start, I know that and I am so happy that I chose this way to reconnect with myself through Yoga after not having practiced for a long time. I was not expecting you to take your mic off but to my own surprise I didn't even feel unsure at all. Right from the beginning it seemed like my body knew what to do and I barely even looked at your video for inspiration. It was really nice to just have you next to me doing your own practice and once in a while our movements would align and it just made today feel all the more special.

Thank you!  I found your channel 4 years ago during the most difficult time of my life and it absolutely transformed me.

In tense moments, I find myself more and more often finding my breath and maintaining balance.  The light your guidance brings to my life is so real and I am so grateful that you continue to stay true to your mission.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

1965.0,"Hi Adriene, I was only 2 days late but I couldn't get on the mat before today for the last practice, because I didn't want this journey to end, because I was afraid of the non-speaking practice as I still consider myself as a baby yogi - doing progress every day though - because I had some rough days again and very bad news this past weekend and preferred to have √© or 3 days break.
And you know what, that may have been my favorite session of this journey, I could ""imagine"" what would come next 2 or 3 times during the video and after all, this non-speaking session was great and you also did a good choice of music. All that got me emotional for I don't know what reason, maybe because it also felt like the end of a nice journey with unknown friends across the globe and I didn't want it to end and now, I understand why you and people here said they got emotional for this one. 
Thank you.

2089.0,"That was truly magical. Thank you!

Like may others I‚Äôm sure, when you said this was unguided I was disappointed and thought ‚Äúuh, I can‚Äôt really do that‚Äù - then throughout, I kept hearing Adriene‚Äôs voice in my head with the phrases reminding us how to do it. The biggest ones were ‚ÄúYou have everything you need‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou got this‚Äù. I‚Äôve completed the 30 days, thinking I was teaching my body, but didn‚Äôt realise Adriene was teaching me how to do ALL of it. That‚Äôs the mark of a really skilled teacher for me, where you don‚Äôt even realise they are teaching you. Just remarkable. I also noticed how beautifully deliberately all the poses were completed, allowing us to see key elements that would prompt our memory.

What stuns me is how all of that has been accomplished on a channel that is also not worried about being relaxed, having the giggles, saying the wrong phrase, or generally drifting off course for a moment. I couldn‚Äôt help noticing the smiles on her face throughout, and I really hope that was because she knew how many would be watching it and being amazed at how much they could now do.

Huge kudos on the whole production as well. The camera work that made sure you could see the moves, only changing when it was important to do so. The choice to make the final one as the sun was setting, somehow so lovely for the last one, and allowing the reflections in the glass to just add more to the beauty of it. And finally, that fact that the closing beats of the music have been used as the intro throughout, so as it ends we‚Äôre reminded of all the beginnings. 

You have told us all that we‚Äôre amazing. I‚Äôll take that, but you guys are utterly amazing as well. Talent and skill at a level that it appears subtle and simple. Thank you again.

2133.0,"wow it's already over! This jouney with so many others came at a very welcome time to me, a lot has happened this month. I am the main care giver of my mother who has medium to late stage alzheimers, at 64(i'm 26 next month). She started hospice early this month, which has been a lot to adjust to but a great help.

This daily practice with hundreds of thousands of others was incredible for grounding me and helping adjust to change.

I've been doing your videos pretty much daily for about a year now, and my relationship to my body and mind have transformed in this year, and in turn my relationship to the world. My moods are abolsutely transformed after each practice, so often I find myself thinking 'nothing is going to get me out of this funk' then after following along to one of your video's I lightly chuckle to myself for thinking that. 

I could go on, but I really just want to say that you've made a big difference in my quality of life, this practice has lead me to other good things. I often hear helpful comments like 'slide your shoulders down the back body' or 'take the biggest breath you have all day' throughout my day haha.

This past 33 days (zero included) it took met to get here I have fallen deeper and deeper in love with myself. 
Thank you all for that support and love community, family, friends, brothers and sisters.
Thank you Adriene for holding space.
It was so wonderful to flow on my own today as my day off for the week lines up perfectly as I end this practice. I continued practicing even as the video ended, from which i then could only hear my housemates downstairs giggling like fairies. Beautifully leading me to this moment I sit in full gratitude for this blessed life we live where love is so real.
As you were someone who introduced me to yoga almost three years ago I am forever thankful for you and your silly reflection of me.
Wishing you all the abundance, fulfillment and joy to you, Benji and everyone in the behind the scenes crew.
Thanks for being you.

Namaste

2240.0,"Day 30 is always the worst for me. First, thank you Adriene (and team) for making this happen. This is the third year I've done your 30 day ""journey"" although I've never done it as each day was released, as I did this year. I come back to these videos all year to try and keep focused and I am grateful that you make them with such care. I do have to say the last day of these things always make me feel like a failure. Even though I've been doing this with you for three years I don't feel like I'm good at doing it on my own. I get distracted, never know how long to hold postures, or what to do next. Listening to music and doing Yoga unguided is not something that works for me. So instead, I always end the journey with a sore neck (from constantly trying to keep an eye on the video) and deflated because it's always such a terrible practice for me. Maybe I am the only one like this and I just suck at Yoga, but I really wish there was another option. Is there no way to release the video (or a second video) with some sort of minimal guide Voice Over or something like that?  I get the point of it being minimal, but having to watch the video constantly for guidance defeats the point, and hurts.

I hope you don't take this the wrong way. I love this time on the mat, and I am just trying to share my experience now (3 years running). Maybe you'll consider us novice practitioners in this final video next time, as you do so well up to Day 29. Anyway, thanks again. Hope this helps. Have a great year. :)",Ugz0Pa_f-hCKx0Es7QN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-02-02T01:18:00Z,-0.9983676075935364

Yesterday I found out I have derealization.
Today I closed my eyes, opened my heart and did those asanas which poped up in my memory from those we did in the previous practices. I went through the memories of this month and realized that this challenge made it a lot more concious. Who knows where could I be now without those practices.
I trully believe this journey saved my mental state. It's not perfect but it's better. I've learned a lot. I've understood a lot. I 've felt a lot. I am more than grateful, Adriene!

After about ten minutes I started to feel more comfortable with what i was doing, and slowed down to a more normal pace.

After all that I was laying on my back, and the music and video stopped, didn't even know where the time went.

Funny before this all started I was going to post something about ""60 days of Yoga?"" but after that last practice I don't think thats necessary.

Anyway thanks Adriene for another month of life changing month, you currently have about 2000 comments that probably all say pretty much the same thing, but I'll throw my hat in and thank you for this as well.

I was almost ready to be done with life.  I‚Äôm a 28 year old actor who hadn‚Äôt acted since 2013 due to lack of discipline, severe depression, fear of failing, and zero desire to do anything for myself.  One of my friends told me about your channel and I thought, it‚Äôs a new year, I‚Äôm willing to try anything.

In the short time I‚Äôve been practicing yoga, my life has changed so much, I‚Äôve already booked and wrapped two industrial film gigs after having no practice for several years, taught myself to eat nothing but nourishing foods and experiment in ways I never imagined I would, and my body is thanking me more than ever.   I‚Äôve never felt so connected to myself and I truly believe that it all started here. I will continue Yoga for the rest of my life and I cannot express how much this has really given me a second wind on life, and I‚Äôm more confident than ever with regards to my acting.

I was let with this half an hour, without Adriene's beautiful voice to guide me and I felt betrayed. But believe me that this was important, even if you just sat in a child's pose for the whole time.  That's the beauty of yoga. To try to listen to your body and go at your own pace.
I'm proud to say that today I only peeked a few times at a video, but just to see what Adriene was doing so I could smile at how unorganized, but good my practice felt.

2515.0,"This was my third year of participating in your amazing 30-day yoga challenges. The first year, I completed the 30 days over the course of about 2 months and struggled to get to the mat and complete each practice. Last year, my first year of college, I only completed about the first 9 days. This year, I took the title to heart and really dedicated myself to this yoga practice. I decided on the first day that I would practice every day as it came and I really did it! I cant even begin to express everything this past 30-days on the mat has taught me, but I can say it is more than I could have ever imagined. It feels so strange to not know if I am doing yoga tomorrow. I want to continue dedicating time to my yoga practice and experience the infinite benefits I know yoga will bring me. After this month of yoga, I have felt noticeably stronger and more in-tune with my body, and I want to keep build upon that! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2599.0,"I‚Äôm very sad to have not been able to do the last video. I‚Äôm disabled and needed the guidance, and so I tried the first 6 minutes but knew it would be harmful rather than helpful to complete a full half hour with my head craned to the left to see the video. I don‚Äôt ask for change but rather just an awareness. It can be discouraging to hear things like, ‚ÄùYou can do this,‚Äù because it makes me feel like if I can‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not whole, and it reminds me that most people can do it. If at all possible maybe in the future you can create two videos for this? One with vocal guidance and one without. 

Anyways, that aside.
Thank you for this journey. It‚Äôs been rough for me because in my life I have to begin a career and it‚Äôs meant acceptibg I‚Äôm disabled. But doing this has given me strength to enter into the Job Corps program, which is a program that will train me in a trade. I‚Äôve been shut out from so many oppoetunities because of disability, and it‚Äôs the first one that I feel truly supported under. 

This journey has helped me keep focus, when the days were hard. It was something to do that was meaningful and also healing. I‚Äôve never stuck to a routine before, and though there were hiccups, I did catch up and finish on time. I‚Äôm really proud. 

I want to continue growing because as I grow, so will my ability to help others.

2635.0,"This was a mixture of emotions. I did not expect the non-mic practice. At first I felt a little awkward and thought I needed to follow everything you were doing. Then i realized that, doing that, I couldn‚Äôt focus on my breath or my body, so I decided to go off on my own way and listen to what my body told me. It was a very interesting experience. When I started moving on my own I kept feeling self conscious and my thoughts were all negative. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing‚Äù ‚Äúyou look so stupid‚Äù..... but then my magical self love spirit came in and said ‚Äúi am beautiful, I can do this!‚Äù ‚ÄúI am grateful for my mat‚Äù ‚ÄúI am grateful for my practice‚Äù. It was very liberating to just let go of the idea of the practice and let go of my thoughts to focus on how my body feels. 
Last year in 2018 I was so ready to do the thirty day challenge but i ended up breaking my hand. At the time I thought it was just life being mean. But I realize now that wether I broke my hand or not, I was not ready to do the challenge. I did not have the insight and the dedication to be consistent and realize what I ACTUALLY want! This was an unbelievably helpful and loving challenge. I plan to continue my daily yoga practice with your playlists. 
Adriene, I am eternally grateful for you and the practices you‚Äôve brought to me. I started doing your yoga videos about four years ago and fell in love with yoga. You brought me to realize getting into your body is one of the most intense acts of self love there is. I have never felt comfortable in my body and with these practices I forced my self in the beginning to be more open and wear less and be more natural and kind with my body. I may not be the fittest or the skinniest person out there but I don‚Äôt care because I have never loved my body more than i do now. I used to be very fit and always was worried about how I looked. my body is constantly changing and your practice helped me to understand that and understand that I actually love the way I look now, even If I‚Äôm a little heavier than I was before. You have also brought insight into my daily life. I learned that i can be consistent in my life and that showing up for yourself and being kind and MINDFUL is immensely important. Not only has this practice helped my view of myself but also helped expand my view of the outside world. With my relationships, my job, my health; yoga has helped greatly. Theres so much more i can say and go into detail about but I know you‚Äôre a busy bee and to sum it all up, Thank you and I love you, Namaste!",UgyzRnXXDUworYVr--h4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2019-02-01T02:27:17Z,0.1880342371661035

However. I didn‚Äôt enjoy this silent practice. I‚Äôm super sad to say I actually turned it off and found another guided practice to do so that I didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd failed. I never make it to the end of these ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù, so I tried to power through but I kept finding myself stressed out with having to check in my peripheral, upset by falling behind or missing moves, as I felt. I decided to bail on this one when I actually teared up because I felt so lost/out of sync.

I'll never forget a beautiful comment made on Youtube after Adriene's ""True"" challenge, and that person's experience resonated with me today. I started off the practice hearing Adriene's loving voice guide me; then that voice transformed into my own. But I finally realized it has been my voice all along. It's always been there, just drowned out by the ugly words I spew towards myself. I'm so glad I found it again on this journey; I fervently hope you have found yours too.

I feel great and I can say that I have felt an increase in my strength in these last 30 days. I think that I am going to re do dedicate again from the start.

I appreciate what you're trying to do with days 30 in terms of turning the mic off, but I find it very stressful to have to interrupt my flow to look up and see what you're doing. Yes of course I could do my own flow, but then what's the point of having the video on and doing yoga with you?

today it took me about 20 minutes to figure out that I do not need to stress myself out trying to imitate Adriene. as soon as I realized this I started my very own practice which was low to the ground. I did hug my legs for a bit, I did bridge pose a few times, I did some scissors, did some baby pulses, did happy baby and then I just stretched out and ended my 30 days lying flat on my back breathing deep. this was just perfect.

dear Adriene thank you soo much for this experience, thank you soo much for your enthusiasm which somehow travels over to me and made me come back to my yoga mat for the past 30 days!!! much love to you, much love to everyone who did these 30 days of yoga with me as well and much love to the rest of the world as well. thank you!",UgzZK_-Kt6jFFomSfBh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-31T22:46:27Z,0.9985882639884949

Wow! Thank you so much!! I‚Äôm crying. Just finished and I did it! It‚Äôs been almost a year since I found your yoga and it‚Äôs just been my everything! When I found you last year I did True but not in real time. This was just amazing doing it everyday and the letters each day and seeing the posts on Instagram! Just thank you and your team so much! This was beautiful! And today was so beautiful and fulfilling! I struggled with the first one without your voice. But this one I relaxed and still glanced at you but trusted myself more and I‚Äôm use to it so I know what was coming. And I could hear your voice in my head guiding me! You are amazing and I‚Äôm so thankful and  blessed that I found you and that you do this! Sending you so much love and have a great day!

However, Dedicate is a lifestyle.

I have put forth an oath to dedicate myself to all that is good, and to remain a shield from that which is bad. I LIBERATE myself from the ego, hate, envy and all that is bad and damaging to the soul. 

This Yogic journey was fruitful for both the body and the soul, and I am forever honored and thankful for your effort.
From my heart to yours, Adriene... 

Namaste.

3114.0,"Adrienne, you amazing human being! I was planning on doing this session tomorrow just because of a stressful schedule and not being in the right state for yoga BUT I am so glad I pushed myself to get on the mat because it was exactly what I needed. What a wonderful and beautiful practice. I am so grateful for your dedication and for having found your youtube channel when I was just getting started with recovering from my eating disorder a couple of years ago. Since then you have been with me on good days but mostly bad ones, keeping me calm and and sane in the storm.

I feel sentimental thinking back to some of those horrible days when getting on the mat was the last thing I wanted to do (I used to work out 3-4 hours a day so I decided to do yoga as a substitute at home when my doctor told me I needed to rest since it was still movement). Today I have come so far and when I get on the mat it's because I love it and because I genuinely want to learn to love my body and, for me, the road to acceptance is found through moving and being present in and with myself.

You have taught me all of those things and I can honestly say that that has been more beneficial than any visit to a psychiatrist. So know, and I'm sure you do but it can be repeated over and over, know that you aren't just teaching us the tools of yoga and moving in a way that feels good - you are teaching us to accept and love ourselves in our own company, teaching us to find a breath that calms and most importantly - teaching us that we are all worth it, worthy of being happy and content with ourselves. <3

Sorry for a long post but I really want you to know how important your work is. And I am so grateful that I have you (and Benji!) in my life. It means the world to me. See you on the mat many more days to come. It doesn't end here!

3183.0,"I have been following your channel since the first 30 day journey that you released. But, I always found an excuse not to finish your programme. This year I did a commitment to treat myself better, and one of the things I wanted to practice daily was yoga. And today I am incredibly proud of myself to say that I have completed this programme, and like you said this is only the beginning, I will continue on this amazing journey. My days have been filled with highs and lows this past month, but, coming back to the mat kept me sane, I felt lighter, I felt like even though the world was going mad some days I could still manage. Some days I was not up for it, but, I kept coming back. Thank you Adriene. You are such a wonderful human being.",Ugzw-Q1HZDeK_Ei9ZMl4AaABAg,0.0,5.0,2019-01-31T18:40:39Z,0.9996517896652222

3185.0,"It's impossible not to get emotional the last day of the program, especially if you've been doing this 30 day experience for 4 years in a row and you've been going through a lot. I started with Kundalini yoga, but I can say for sure that you, Adriene, ignited my passion for Ashtanga (even if I Iike when you mix it up a bit!). I didn't want to share this, but I'm going to do it, hoping it could be of some help: I'm a fitness lover and I usually train 6 days week, but last summer I lost my father. I didn't have the physical and psychological strength to workout for weeks, the only thing I could do was yoga: in the darkest time of my life, it helped me investigating my heart, facing the grief and embracing the advice that my dad gave me: to live in the moment, because the present is the only time we really own. It's  not easy, but this is what I'll be working on this year. So thank you, Adriene: I send my love to you, to Benji and to all the people around the world who participated in this program. And remember everyone: maybe yoga is not THE ONLY WAY to heal your heart and your soul, but is for sure A WAY to get up on your feet when life smashes you down on the floor.

3196.0,"Dear Adriene, thank you. The goal that I set on Day 1 was to establish daily yoga practise as my new form of workout. I had gone overboard with my bodyweight exercise routine before, and I was being too hard on myself about everything happening in life and university, so I suffered from chronic back pain and was grinding my teeth at night. I had practised with your yoga videos before, but following along on the Dedicate journey is an experience on a whole other level. I learned so much from you and from myself, that I kept a journal, writing down a thing that I learned or realized after each video, each day. I am now able to transfer that wisdom and that curiosity off the mat and into my daily life. My jaw tension is gone and my back pain only reappears once a week, and the next yoga practise wipes it away. I am in awe and I could not be more thankful for this experience and the whole community travelling along. I got into my own flow today, practising mostly with my eyes closed, and everytime I saw you on the screen it made me so very happy. All my love, Martha",Ugwg19xJ9bQTXvvhnFd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-31T18:30:53Z,0.9853935241699219

3246.0,"Adrienne, you are amazing and the community you've built is absolutely incredible. I've tried committing to the 30 days for the past 4 years and never made it past the first two weeks. This year, however, on the heels of a 3 month solo journey abroad, something clicked. I stopped thinking about this as a ""workout"" but rather as a self-care and mental health practice. Quickly my day didn't feel complete without some ""quiet time in my love cave"" haha. Like many others in the comments, this final practice made me really emotional. I began with a gratitude meditation with tears streaming down my face and ended the same way. I am so proud of myself for sticking with this. I've found myself finally applying breathwork to my daily life off the mat and was shocked by how much my physical strength and balance have improved in just 30 days. Thank you, thank you, thank you. To you, to myself, and to everyone in the community -- especially the nearly 5K people who did the practice with me (!!!). Here's to a new beginning for all of us.

3315.0,"I've been doing Yoga with Adriene for a little over three years now. I always wanted to have some form of exercise that I looked forward to and Yoga was that for me! Unfortunately as a student I really couldn't afford to pay for classes on my budget. I was also so self-conscious about how often I'd fall out of poses due to an injury on the job to my left hip, so I was often too self conscious to do yoga with others. Still, I was determined to do this for myself. That's when I found this channel! 

I did it on and off over the years and it helped keep me fit while teaching overseas. This past November I decided I'd really commit to it and do 30 minutes a day. In January when Dedicate started, I bumped that up to a full hour a day. Not only is the weakness in my injured hip gone, but I just feel so light in body and mind. I feel so strong and energetic! Now my sister and I are saving up to take a trip together to Nepal to start our yoga instructor training. <3 I wouldn't be this version of me that I respect and honor without you.

3362.0,"This was my first 30 day yoga journey, but certainly will not be my last. I'm so proud of myself for completing each practice, though I did do days 22-25 all on day 25.  During that time, my mom had fallen down the stairs and broke her wrist and badly sprained her ankle. I was having a really hard time dealing with everything that was involved with that situation and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't slightly traumatized from the experience. I felt a lot of guilt for skipping those days, but then so much relief when I caught up and got back to caring for myself too. There's a lot of pressure involving my aging mom who has both physical and mental disabilities, and even harder without any other family to help out. I'm so lucky to have a supportive husband who reminds me of what I should and shouldn't help her with as I've done too much for her the past year causing her to unnecessarily rely on me for certain things. I'm learning where I have to draw boundaries, not just for her but for my own sanity. I love your frequent message of needing to take care for ourselves first so that we can better help others. I have everything I need and more to continue with this amazingly therapeutic form of self-care, including a much nicer yoga mat that I ordered a couple weeks ago and left wrapped up to start using once this series ended, as well as an annual subscription to your site. Thank you so much, Adriene and the team. You've helped me in more ways than you know.",UgzufjR4fd-drCsRIIF4AaABAg,0.0,4.0,2019-01-31T16:17:47Z,0.9959716200828552

3404.0,"Thank you for this amazing 30 day journey.  I made it it the mat every day.  I can say that my low back pain is gone and for the first time in 2 years I am running without any pain in my left calf.  

Some asanas are still difficult for me, especially anything with one legged balance.  I still have difficulty walking folded over to the front of the mat.  Forward folds set off my sciatica so I did those with my legs bent.  I started using blocks on some poses to bring the ground up to me as I realized I was not square in my hips or I was leaning to one side.  

I found you about 18 months ago and would do a few days a week one of your videos.  In 2017 we were on vacation and I did your gentle yoga for beginners for 7 days in a row which led me to True.  Unfortunately I never finished True because of a death in my family but I still regularly tuned into one of your videos.  2018 found me on vacation again and this time I was having bad back pain, sciatica, and piriformis pain.

I've tried the 30 days journey twice before and this is the first time I manage to both start on the 1st of January and not miss a day.
Which I don't think I could have accomplished without the daily emails filling me up with vitality.

You have shown me time and time again that change is possible & that I can finish what I start. All it takes is to show up and roll out the mat, dedicating one day at a time. Everything else comes naturally.
I'm hoping that by managing to make it a habit I won't forget as easily.

Thank you Adriene and crew.

I was so disappointed. The second year I thought, okay I'll give it try. It was difficult not to be doing just what I was told to do. This year, wow, I finally get it.

3700.0,"Dearest Adriene,
How can a human being who I have never met in person. who I can only see on a two dimensional screen, make me feel as though she is sitting right beside me, as though she is a dear friend who I trust wholly and completely?  When I read your love letter this morning, I felt both anxious and a sense of calm, with part of me not wanting to go through the morning without your voice to guide me, and the other part knowing it would be, and still another part knowing that your voice was guiding me to hear my own.  I settled in, and when you walked onto the mat and looked at the camera and smiled, it was as though you were in the room with me, and I too, smiled as I began to cry... and then flow.  


I have been practicing yoga in a very off and on kind of way for 20 years.  In those years, I have often said that I love how yoga makes me feel and wish that I would discipline myself and make it a regular habit.  I discovered your videos on YouTube about six months ago when I decided to stop paying for a gym membership I wasn't getting my money's worth from because it felt like another thing to check off the daily to-do list, rather than something I yearned to do.  Any day I carved out time for yoga, I would scroll through your list of videos and pick whatever my soul said yes to.  On New Year's Day, I happened to need some guidance, and that is when I discovered your invitation to this 30 day journey.  There was no debate, no struggle - my soul simply welcomed the invitation and signed on with an open heart.


I didn't miss a day.  This is the first time in all my years that I haven't felt a struggle to commit to something I wanted.  And I know that this journey will continue, because of you.  Yes, yes, of course - because of me, (smile) - but a student needs a guide, and a soul needs inspiration.  


The work you are doing is such a gift on this planet.  I am so inspired by you and thankful to have discovered you.  Thank you for contributing to the love and health and well being of this planet.  Thank you for your compassion and creativity and heart.  I am going to join membership - I cannot think of a better way to support your calling and to contribute to this beautiful and loving community and legacy you are creating.

My body knows exactly what it wants and I can listen in and just go with the flow. 2. I can grow poses out of other poses, and it feels very natural and good. 3. Moments of unexpected synchronicity happen! After a while I diverged from the video and just went with whatever my body was craving, and sometimes I looked up and Adriene was doing the same. We're both trees! Like a beautiful mirror. 4. Sometimes I look up, and we're doing different things. And even though I'm a lizard, or a pigeon, and you are a humble warrior, I know where you are and what that feels like. I had such zen moments. It was awesome. I also noticed how much more mindful some of my poses have become, even tabletop position. And how every recurring downward dog feels softer and longer. And last but not least: I can come down into self-care and self-love mode and just enjoy the developing softness and warmth and then relax and let go.

Sometimes it was extremely difficult to get on the map, but I always thought about how I felt after every session and it motivated me to practice.

I am truly grateful for this journey and honestly, I can't imagine not practicisng anymore at this time, so in February I'll go through Yoga Camp again.

3832.0,"Somehow the end of that, where the ""Dedicate"" music came in during the Nameste brought tears to my eyes and I had to go and sit in the sun for a bit having some tea to reflect on why, while my five-year-old son demands that I now play some ""Queen"" (""on the train"" i.e. ""Breakthru"").  Thanks for that Adriene from the bottom of my heart.  I was brought up without the discipline of self-love (though I was thankfully brought up with the discipline of going to church regularly) and this month this course has developed my self-discipline, also connected to regular meditation and the Wim Hof breathing exercises and proper diet.  I have to teach my son this self-discipline.  He joined in with me today but gave up after a while as it was ""too long"", but I convinced him that going beyond ""too long"" can be good for us.  I'm a trainer who is now going to do workshops on self-discipline as self-love in my seminars.  Here's love to you and all.",UgwQsvlbp-Bqhe4_AiJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-31T08:53:29Z,-0.978536069393158

That was the best out of the three years
Very thoughtful practice of positioning ..taking time for us to place ourselves before the next move
Like you did in the dark early morning..found it challenge to do one leg stands with no lighting on though..until I decided less us more so went easy 
Music appropriate for this poetry like practice..whereupon the  moves build upon the journey of dedicate so I fou d it easy to feel for what you would do next in the flow.. familiar with the added space of newness. 
As a poet  enjoyed the fluidity

With yoga for sure, but I haven't decided yet if I'm just gonna revisit one of the past 30 days with Adriene, choose a random yoga video, do yoga completely on my own (which I have noticed today I'm lacking some connecting flows, sometimes I find it hard to not just get from one posture into the next) or if I'm looking into some more advanced 30 day challenges however I have never found anyone yoga channel on YouTube which gives me the same good feeling as yours Adriene. There's quite a lot out there who leave me feeling uncomfortable and rushed on the mat. But I'd love a challenge which focuses more on deeper stretches and some advanced postures.

What a lovely journey this has been. And to you dear friend also practicing today, regardless of what Day you are in, have a good one and keep practicing.
