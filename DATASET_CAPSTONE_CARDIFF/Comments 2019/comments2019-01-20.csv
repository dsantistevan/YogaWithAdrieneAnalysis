I now believe I can find grace and listening to myself all day today, even off the mat. I can do it all.❤️ And whoever is reading this, you are capable, you are awesome and beautiful!❤️ Sending love to all the wonderful people out there. You deserve love and kindness.

It really connected with me today.For a while now I've been on my awakening journey and for the past few months I have been self learning about water and how it is connected to us, I have it all confirmed for me while listening to tao te ching. It makes mention of so many water qoutes and how it is used as a perfect alogory.
Yesterday i was auto playing Alan watts and i heard him speaking of the breath of the ocean and then he did it for a while. I was hardly paying attention but just enough to remember it, today of all days I do this practice and low and behold there it is again.

That’s life and we’re here to learn the best way to navigate this thing. Earlier today I told myself that all I need is yoga, bob marley music, and my family to be alright. 

Also! I never thought of my breath as my soul before, but to me it makes sense since we’re literally hearing one part of what animates us (the other being the heart).

533.0,"Day 19 was beautiful practice to sustain my growth. Before this practice, I decided to do weights for the first time in years. I exercised my biceps, and hamstrings to counter the quads and triceps that I tend to work out when pushing out on the mat. It has been years since I did weights. When I use to do weights, I was never mindful and would not breathe properly. I did 20 minutes and focused on my breathe and was mindful of the practice. Then I did this practice and it was serene. Time flew. That was an easy 40 minutes that I spent working on my body and reconnecting with myself. Namaste y'all!",UgxHvg60wuPfYiKisd54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-20T19:19:59Z,0.9990168809890747

How amazing it felt today to smoothly flow through the poses and learning to listen along the way, to Adriene's surprisingly calming voice of guidence, as well as the sound of my own breath. So proud of myself to have done this with no struggle whatsoever compared to when i first started this challenge. I'm now adopting the skill of keeping an open mind and listening to people from every background/ field with different opinions to expand my knowledge and thrive towards a bright future. Morning yoga routine complete; way to commit to 2/3 of the challenge everyone. Only 10 days left to go. We're getting there so don't give up. Much love.
