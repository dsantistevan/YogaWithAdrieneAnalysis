One of the greatest lessons ever bestowed on me is one that has come time and time again. 
In every stage, in many, many forms.
It’s always the same. Someone whispers, or shouts…
Find the joy.
So tell me, my friends, what brings you joy?",UgxaHTpwjC8Rxv0IHGp4AaABAg,22.0,238.0,2019-01-24T14:01:04Z,0.9998286962509155

I was focusing on letting go, enjoying the moments, I even cried a little. Because I was trying so hard to let go. But I don't need to try that hard. I will go do what I can to lift all the weight off my shoulders. When I finished this practice, I told myself: ""I'd like to repeat this right now"". Should I? Maybe I should listen, yes.

And now today flying from one side to the other with unsupported one-armed planks? As if that's a perfectly reasonable progression from supported ones? The other two days I could stand it because she at least offered an alternative, and acknowledged that might be too much for some. But today there was no acknowledgement of that, I was like ""Okay...guess I'll just stay here in plank then...""

In order to maintain steadiness in a half plank, you have to show love towards your wrists and give the weight to your foot. The analogy’s not my best one, but I hope you get my point here.

140.0,"Comment #2. This came to mind as I was browsing the comments (I LOVE reading comments. I saw someone else say this on another video, but your comment section is nothing but love and light).


With most workout or yoga videos I've done on youtube, I usually give up when it gets hard. I either quit the video all together or I sit out the pieces that I struggle with. This is problematic as it means that I teach myself not to ever push myself and that it takes me a long time to get stronger. So long, in fact, that I normally give up. I know there are some day when you need to take it easy (that's why it's taking me longer than 30 days to get through this) but I also know you do have to push yourself sometimes... so I started pushing myself through the hard parts back in the first week of videos.


From pushing myself I learned one amazing thing: to trust Adriene. I noticed that you really seem to know your audience well and you never throw out more than I can handle. Usually, when I give up, you only do one more or one more cycle of breath and I always end up thinking, ""I totally could of made it through that"" to the point where I find myself rarely giving up anymore. When I want to I think to myself, ""Trust, she never does more than you can handle."" And sometimes your mantra of, ""You have everything you need here"". I can definitely feel myself getting stronger, physically and mentally.",UgzEsOPnPe_o88Sv6fx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-17T07:05:59Z,-0.6024979948997498
141.0,"I forgot to write that in the Day 22 practice when we extended our legs out into plank I accidentally kicked my cat in the face and had to cease and desist yoga so that I could try to convince him that it was an accident and that I loved him very dearly.


He seemed totally over it today so I think we're good now.


:) I haven't been commenting as much because I feel as if I have less and less to say. I feel like my emotions and thoughts have calmed down... I am more steady... and today I was really able to embrace the JOY. I've been a lot kinder to myself. I'm not sure if it's the yoga or the yoga and a combination of other factors but I'm starting to feel happier.


The yoga is probably a really big factor.

I decided to take more notice anyhow, send more energy there, keep them engaged, feel the ground, the list goes on. I didn't notice any changes until today. I was snowboarding after a year off and oh my goodness, all that new awareness in my feet brought much more control and made me fly down the slopes! I couldn't even believe myself.

I'm getting stronger, planks used to be the bane of my yoga practice and now I find comfort in the heat they bring. I could go on and on about everything I'm noticing every day in my body, but the one that's the most life-changing is that for the first time my body feels like it's actually mine.

I Haven next to zero strength in my muscles, find it hard to keep balance or bend over my belly, but this is maybe the first time in 35 years that this body of mine THANKS me for moving it. I've never been a friend of any sports or physical activities. 

It's a good thing the sessions are rather short, too. My days are long and tiresome, today I did the yoga at almost 11 pm. I'm considering to pass one day's practise so I could do that one next morning. To see if it's on me to start my days with adriene, not finish them with her as i'm doing now (it's already 8:30 in the morning here in Finland, when the daily video is released,  and by then i'm already at work).

By the way, through today's practice I realised that my arms became much stronger. I could never do a single pushup in my whole life, my arms were just so weak, but now I can easily (and steadily) lower myself onto my stomach without just plopping down.

463.0,"This yoga journey has already opened me in ways I never imagined. Recently, I was asked for a class to write an 'ode to too familiar things'. Things that I take for granted. This is what I wrote. I think some of you might relate. 

I step on my yoga mat everyday,
to connect with myself,
to treasure myself, 
like old women worship
photos of their youth. 
As if their nubile bodies
were roman sculptures,
now worn by the wind 
and water of time. 

I find my feet on my mat. 
Heels and toes kissing the firm,
yet forgiving surface. 
Steady as an ancient forest, 
my mat cradles me. 
She is a dedicated mother,
supporting her newborn.

Here I am able to land. 
Setting aside the to-do lists,
the worries, 
this sense of ‘never enough’,
scattered like trash in my mind.

She protects me in this way.
Shielding me from the chaos,
allowing me to find sanctuary.
My breath surrenders to this temple
of clear skies and silent solace.
I dedicate myself to this sacred ocean of discovery,
and in return,
I am held by her, 
with the resolve of Buddhist monks seeking alms, 
and scrubbing the floors of their Stupa.

Here my mat plants seeds of trust 
into the garden of my soul. 
She nourishes me with 
The echo of my breath, 
the wisdom of my heart. 
She makes me whole.",Ugzl5bBzPP9rh-rQRlx4AaABAg,45.0,468.0,2019-01-24T15:03:20Z,0.9989020824432373
