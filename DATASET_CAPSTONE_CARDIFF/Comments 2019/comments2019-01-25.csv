28.0,"Here is a reminder for everyone to be less critical to ourselves. I missed practice a few days, not because I was extremely busy or because I was feeling miserable. I easily could have showed up, but I simply didn't... And although I tell myself that it is okay, deep down I do judge myself and think I should just practice every day in order to get all the benefits from daily yoga. And also when being on the mat, I am still critical sometimes. Physically I am most of the time perfectly able to do all the poses, that isn't too hard for me, but truly feeling the pose and moving though everything with patience and love and consciousness is sometimes still a struggle. But all of this, the self-judging, the whole journey is more valuable than the ""outcome"" of this journey. This is how we learn, how we get to know ourselves better, and that is so so so so valuable and beautiful.

The slow, mindful beginning was excellent for me as I could pay attention to muscles that like to tighten in my body's attempt to compensate for what the eyes are not doing correctly to keep me in balance.  It gave me time to loosen muscles and try to find that balance you speak of in both sides of the body as one side tends to do more of the work than the other.

I started out okay, but once I tried to extend  the foot out and grab the arch all my balance went out the window. I fell twice and got frustrated with myself, losing focus.

Maybe I should have focused on staying balanced rather than following Adriene into the more complex positions. I‚Äôm sorry for getting frustrated as even though I tried to catch up, it definitely negatively affected my practice. My advice is to stay positive through falls, we‚Äôre not all perfectly balanced. But does anyone have any advice on improving my balance? ( I don‚Äôt have a mat so I‚Äôm going bare foot on carpet if that affects anything. Anyway I‚Äôll be more positive tomorrow!

BALANCE is the secret ingredient to success in this world. Moderation is key, give everything its worth. Never more never less. This includes any form of foundation, it must be strong and only through a balanced system will it ever achieve that. 

Namaste.

I loved it and was excited to see the new Dedicate series.  I started it on Day 1 and did it every day until 14 January.  Unfortunately on 15th Jan I was rushed into hospital with pancreatitis and I had my gall bladder removed this week.  I'm now home and recovering from keyhole surgery.  I'm sure the increased arm and leg strength I've gained in my practice to date has helped me this week.

I'm looking for a way to get back into practice maybe in a week or so. My surgeon said I can start again when I feel up to it.  Please can you suggest some of your videos that I can start with? Maybe with less floor work or downward dog for starters. I'm looking forward to when I'm back to normal and can restart Dedicate from the beginning.

828.0,"Three years ago when I started yoga with Adriene I was afraid of balancing like Harry Potter feared dementors. I haven't noticed how it happened but practices on balance are definitely my favourite now. Thank you so much, Adriene and all of your team, deep from my heart. For everything, you've done for me, for my life, for my consciousness. I think there are so many people around the Earth who consider you as one of the most valuable people for them, together with their best friends and relatives. I am among them.
