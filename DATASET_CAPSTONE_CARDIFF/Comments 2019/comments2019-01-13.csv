6.0,"I don't know if someone is going to read this but from pigeon 'till the end of the video I was sobbing. Not because I was sad or to release tension, but because for the first time I noticed it was over. The war was over, the self hatred, all the abusive relationships and friendships, all the self destructive behaviors, the need for external validation, the nights I spent crying because I am the way I am. All my hard work all the promises I made to myself, they worked. Two years ago I wanted to take my life, I hit the rock bottom. Now, I have a regular practice of yoga for a year, I am getting to know this little person inside me, which is me, and they are really fun, I am even eating healthy, something I havent done in my entire life. I started taking care of myself and loving it, taking care of this little child that sometimes didn't have the attention they needed. And what a nice, creative, funny and magical kid I have inside me! Day by day, I was getting better, and being able to do more and more. One day, after months of working on myself, getting myself out of this rock bottom, I felt I was mentally and physically strong enough to do yoga. Next month I will celebrate a year of ywa, with all the highs and lows, all the days I didn't have the energy to get out of bad and do it, I still kept going when I could. Some days you have to be patient and loving and just stay in bed healing. But it's been a year! And it has helped me so much to know myself and accept where I am right now.
Today I just cried out of happiness, in pigeon pose, with my hands connected to the earth, because after two years of recovering, of re-building everything this world destroyed inside me, and I helped the world destroying, after all that work, I realized it was over and I would never be like that again. I WILL commit new mistakes, but now even when I feel alone, I have this little one inside to take care of. I hugged myself lying on my back and cried with a smile in my face, saying to myself: ""see? do you see how far did we come? I'm so proud, so so proud of you, I love you"". And a saw a perfectly blue sky through my window and I knew it was over. The war against myself, you know. 
And I hope that everyone that took time to read that can feel like that as well.

I had a victorious, albeit painful solo finish in just under 4 hours, not my best by a long shot but not my worst time either.  I worried that Adriene was going to be up for heat today (curate?) and didn't want to cancel anything else in my life (COVID)...omg- this practice was AAAAAAHHHHMAZING for my EVERYTHING!

39.0,"Hi Adriene and all fellow lovers of everything Adriene - I just wanted to take a moment to express my immense gratitude for you and this community. I would like to share with you my personal story to show you the impact that you have had in my life. My own personal journey has seen me through some very severe depression, anxiety, and a recent bipolar diagnosis. I have been cycling through meds trying to find the right one for me. I have a therapist. I do the work. Through my healing journey you have been a consistent thread. I have completed 2 of your 30 day challenges and I have practiced along side so many of your videos. You rock. I used to live in Austin and had to move to Houston to be closer to family to heal. You connect me back to a city that I love and bring so much positive beautiful energy and share it with this world. 3 years ago I completed my studies Yoga Teacher Training and studies in Ayurveda in Rishikesh and almost become a yoga teacher myself. I even started a business in Austin to bring Ayurveda and the knowledge of India to our Austin community. My personal life and my personal work had other plans for me and while that never fully came to fruition I continue my own personal practice and you are such a big part of it. Thank you Adriene for being one of the most authentic teachers I have found and authentic humans on youtube. Today was a really hard day for me but I found myself looking forward to my practice with you as I always do. The time flies and I leave with more love and gratitude in my heart than when I stepped onto the mat.

51.0,"I have never commented before, but I really have to thank you, Adriene, from the bottom of my heart. I know you are constantly flooded with notes of gratitude, and so even if mine falls into the abyss of lost letters, knowing that I sent you a bit of gratitude for the way you have changed my life means everything to me. Honestly, I am often plagued by mild cases of built-up anxiety that lead to procrastination as I lose touch with myself. It's always been hard for me to stick to anything, whether it's healthy eating habits or exercise regimens. Yoga, on the other hand, has inspired positive change within my life, without the dread or lack of self compassion that accompanies overly intense discipline. I remember the first session of yoga I ever experienced, about three years ago, which just so happened to be a part of your series for beginner's. I didn't understand how much I'd fall in love with the practice when I first began, as early on I was often brought to tears for reasons I still don't completely understand. All I know is that I was beating myself up and bottling up my feelings. Now, facing my inner truth, it's hard for me not to smile when I feel the sensations and flushes of energy that are so signature to the practice. Whenever I fall out of a regular exercise, I always end up coming back to yoga, where I can release my baggage and let go of festering negativity. I realize how I tend to handle my emotions with impulsiveness and ignorance, and now I have been given the tools I need to show myself love and listen to my heart. But I couldn't have done it without you, Adriene! Nothing compares to your evident warmhearted and genuine personality. Every day when I arrive at the mat I am sure to be invited to a comfortable place where mindfulness, understanding, and kindness are put first. You always share beautiful words of wisdom, as well as random bits of humor that always make me laugh! I cannot believe I am still here, but I am, and this is my fourth 30 days of Yoga experience with you. Lots of Love!!!",UgwTAys9C7LbyVYuUn14AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-06-25T02:06:33Z,0.9959412813186646

Grew up in ballet, nearly 5 years  ago snapped all the ligaments in my ankle, could do nothing. Have always had some depression and anxiety issues but medication  didn’t help much and side effects were awful. Earlier this year in February I lost my baby at 15 weeks after trying for 4 years to have a baby. My friend has been telling me to try yoga with you forever, I tried before my ankle was ready but after my miscarriage I started doing yoga everyday. Because of yoga I am functional after this miscarriage. I feel like a new person. More energy since I was a child. No anxiety, WAAAAY less depression, I get out of bed everyday to do yoga to help me function for my other kids. Nothing hurts anymore! You, and yoga have changed my life and made it livable.

141.0,"So I got distracted in January but I started this over and am loving the journey once again.  I wanted to comment on this practice in particular; I was getting pretty anxious and a little depressed about an upcoming situation.  I'd done Curate the night before and suddenly remembered that I am responsible for my own happiness.  I realized I was trying to put that responsibility on an outside source/outcome.  Having that reminder fresh in recent experience really helped me take back my ownership of my happiness, which in turn significantly decreased my anxiety.  Thank you so much for your continued wisdom, encouragement, guidance, and humor.  It's good for our bodies and so, so much more.  xoxo",Ugwn05DhHdlpaAnMuml4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-05-30T03:20:35Z,0.9990572333335876

145.0,"It's so funny because I started my yoga journey maybe three months ago and been doing yoga almost every day since, AND EVERY TIME I do yoga with you and you say ""put your right foot then your left"" I always do the opposite. In the beginning I was so frustrated and was mad because I couldn't even do that simple thing. But throughout the journey I've learned that it doesn't really matter if I put the left or right foot first, I'm still going towards the same destination. Maybe this sounds silly but now I just smile every time I put the left foot first because it makes me happy that I listen to my body and move with what feels good.

I feel like this year's 30 day journey got Adrienne just moving TOO FAST sometimes in the videos and that really makes me feel frustrated because I don't feel like last year's 30day journey, in which I had plenty of time to experience all the poses and feelings. Now it just feels like sometimes Adrienne is a bit too hurried. And also, on the other hand, sometimes she goes into some tricky and trembling pose and then comes out of it just to start talking for like a whole minute straight - and I'm at the yoga mat trembling and sweating and just thinking ""omg can't you talk during some more chilling pose""?

221.0,"I've been practicing yoga irregulary for about 7 years but I never stick with it for a long time. It's usually 2-3 months and then I slowly cease to do it anymore - because I'm busy, tired or lazy - and it usually takes me about 4-6 six  months to start over. Every single time when I need to start over, I'm angry at myself that I was not able to continue before because there is always a voice in my head during the practice telling me ""You managed to do this before"" or ""You used to be better at this"". Even when I'm struggling, I try to be kind to myself but it is not always easy. However, today for a very first time I realized that this time I focus more on how I do things, how I perform every position and I think it is great even if I used to be better at doing that position like two years ago.

I actually ended up doing 2 videos today because even after finishing day 11 my body said I needed more. As I kept going my body just started feeling better and better, and I felt like I could do a little more with each breath I took. Just before Adriene said we were going to do one-legged pigeon it clicked that that's what my body was really craving and I when she said it I just smiled and thought ""I'm already on my way there because you've taught me how to listen to my body"", when I came out of pigeon and started rocking and rolling into corpse I felt my body saying it needed a shoulder stand too. When I finally came to corpse pose the only way I can describe how my body felt, and still feels now, is like warm butter just this wonderful warm supple feeling through every ligament. I was in a horrible place physically and mentally when I decided to try yoga 4 years ago and I'm so incredibly grateful that Adriene's site is the first one I found, I know I wouldn't have kept coming back if I had found any of the other instructors I've seen since starting this journey. Because of Adriene's mantra of ""find what feels good"" I've learned to listen to my body and to step away when I need to. I've lost some toxic people through this awakening and I couldn't be more grateful, I'm excited to see where this journey takes all of us who's lives she has touched.",Ugw9BZ0365JIkpEbKUt4AaABAg,0.0,4.0,2019-01-21T06:47:22Z,0.9968589544296265

819.0,"I agree that we are in control of our own happiness but only to an extent. It’s important to remember that racism, sexism, etc. are very real elements that are deeply woven into the culture - at least in the USA. Many people struggle and suffer as a result of these systems and it’s important not to blame someone because they are poor, or addicted or whatever. In other words, this idea is important but should come with the caveat that many things are beyond our control and being unhappy or anxious or whatever is a natural and human response. No one should feel as though they’ve failed or are inadequate if they’re not happy 100% of the time. Our culture is a bit obsessed with finding happiness to the point where we might feel like any other emotion is wrong or bad. Sorry for the rant but it’s an issue that’s close to home and I saw someone who commented that they felt badly and then felt guilty. Food for thought is all... I’m loving the practice and it’s opened a lot of space for me mentally. Thank you !",UgwDCSOqtUMRbYMoSR14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-13T12:49:16Z,0.9975442290306091

837.0,"I was up at 5:00 am today! 🤣 I had to cook something early in my crockpot so it gave me an opportunity to take some time out before a busy busy day. I actually didn’t sleep too well last night. I “being responsible for my own happiness” had something a little too spicy for me last night haha. Therefore I lost count as to how many times I woke up last night. I make it a rule to myself not to look at the time when I do. I kept having dreams that I needed to be up on time to be sure and do my yoga and put the food in the crockpot. My right elbow is inflamed too. It is quite stiff and I think the spice maaaay have a part in it. Whoops. Lol

Today I am happy I got up to do day 12. It was well worth it. I had a tad trouble rotating my left leg especially in downward dog. Lol. Each side is different of course.

I chuckled when you used Patrick Stewart’s voice. Haha 😂 


I am so very thankful for finding you Adriene. It has been almost two years following your videos. I have learned so much. It has been such a ride and experience learning yoga through you. 3 years ago I was diagnosed with an autoimmune thyroid disorder and finding you in the process of healing has been such a blessing. I have learned to look inward more and not focus solely on body image and such. My idea has morphed and it still changes and unfolds. I used to find people would keep a way from me and I always wondered “what am I doing wrong?” and then something changed. I know it is positivity and I recognize with my personality type that I can be alone when need be. That it is okay. I am who I am and everything is unfolding. My chiropractor told me at my last visit, “I love hearing your new discoveries of better health. When I think of you I think, ‘ooh what is next’” It puts a new perspective on where I am. It sheds light and I am grateful of the process. Thank you.",UgyiFRxyd__Vf3nnRE14AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-01-13T11:29:29Z,0.9932670593261719

You have taught me so much. And the importance here is not that your teachings are definite; they are merely tools to apply to different situations occurring in different times in your life. And I now recognize how I can use them in each situation and ADAPT them.

Teaching us to move with intention is probably the most vital part of this journey. What we radiate is what we feel and what the world will feel from us. And I have noticed such a difference in my mind since I became aware of this. Thank you for teaching us mindfulness and self love in secret while we're holding on to plank for dear life. Thank you for always focusing on what should feel good. Thank you for helping us to challenge ourselves when we think we can't do it. Thank you for lighting that inner smile and inner light in that dark space. Thank you for always being there. Thank you for supporting EVERYONE and acknowledging EVERYONE. Thank you for pointing out that we are all welcome. Thank you for turning our homes in to a safe and calm spot where we can be ourselves and maybe along the way finding the courage to take it outside in to the world as well.

Let's curate this as a responsibility of our own, one that we must fulfill, for which our body is guaranteed to thank us along the way through the challenge and even later in life when we're through with the 30 days. Harness the power of discipline within yourself to strengthen self-respect and thus self-esteem which ultimately leads to an increase in confidence and self-control to hopefully make you the best version of yourself to ever be seen both by yourself and others.
