I was scrolling through YouTube to pass the time & stumbled upon your videos. I went out to TJ Maxx, found a clearance yoga mat for $6(scoreüí™üèº) and followed along with your 30 days of yoga. I swear you & yoga have transformed my life. I look forward to it & do 3-4 videos in a row sometimes. I can touch my toes, I feel HAPPY, beautiful & peaceful. I love your personality & am so grateful to you for introducing me to beginner friendly yoga. I plan on becoming an instructor myself & helping women who felt just like I did feel empowered & not so alone. THANK YOU ADRIENE from the depth of my soul & bottom of my heart.

Wow, you are so amazing Adriene.  You bring out the best in all of us and I'm so grateful.  I've only been doing yoga for 7-8 weeks since I discovered you on You Tube. Through the incredible Dedicate journey I have learned so much about myself and my abilities, not just with regard to strength but in all areas of my life. Ive always been upbeat and positive and have practised and read self development books for 20 years or more but this yoga journey has somehow connected everything. It's as though I have woken up, I feel so alive, and it's all thanks to you for giving all these wonderful teachings for free. Thank you seems inadequate but thank you so much.  This must be your life's purpose Adriene and the light in you shines very brightly indeed.   My life is now moving in a new and  exciting  albeit a little scary direction, but yoga and your teachings have shown me that it's ok, I can deal with it.  You are a beautiful person and I feel truly honored and humbled to be a part of all this, even more so after reading so many of the wonderful upbeat, positive comments from the many other people out there who like me who needed some direction and it couldn't have come from a better place than this.

103.0,"Hey, Adriene! Today I decided that when I start college, I will be doing  this to go with it. I'm a teenager who has battled with self esteem issues my whole life, and makeup is something I run to, scared. It's gotten to the point where my body quite literally is physically tight and stressed when I wear makeup. When I take it off, every time, the tension leaves my body.

I'm sick and tired of feeling like I can't be pretty without makeup, and I'm sure I've developed a little facial dysphoria because of it. 

So I saw this, and I saw that people are having their lives and mentalities and self images transformed and basically reborn. I really really want that. In fact, I *need* that.  So I'm doing it, and I'm not gonna wear makeup the entire month. I am so so scared just typing that. 

Wish me luck! I love you :)",Ugxujsqwaz-p-1bQecF4AaABAg,1.0,8.0,2019-03-29T13:45:39Z,-0.512945294380188

59.0,"I'm so grateful for everything you and your team are doing for this channel. Thank you for this amazing opportunity to have amazingly elaborated, guided, heartwarming and comforting yoga practices just one click away. Adriene, you're so natural and thoughtful, I love that, everybody loves that, that's why your channel attracts a lot of people. I've been following you for 2 years and I still can't stop admiring the way you approach your audience, the way you give them space. It's so pleasing to watch somebody being themselves. It helps people relax and find themselves. 

I've enjoyed this journey so much! Your messages to the world, your explanations, music, scenery, Benji !!! 
Now I'm on the day 1 of your new journey Home )

And the most IMPORTANT: You taught me how to find what feels good, how to transform everything I learned from you into my own practices, you gave me that space I was looking for. It feels wonderful to be able to do yoga on my own, to listen to myself, and AT THE SAME TIME, to crave for practicing with you. Only with your videos, I do not forget to breathe and be present. You've opened yoga for me as a way to live my life consciously, stay present and love myself and not only as a workout practice (like many others focus on). Yoga definitely cannot be described as one of the sports activities, its more than that. And, if anything, sport is rather a form of meditation in the first place. We have to take up activities that fulfill our bodies as well as our minds with good vibes. 

We all know that truely feel-good experiences in life are free. Thank you for dedicating yourself! 

I don't know what one feels when there is so much attention to them and what it feels to have so big community, but I'm sure you as well as your team often feel overwhelmed and I just want you to know that we SUPPORT you and ACCEPT any decision of yours.

I started following your 30-day programs a while back. It was a wonderful opportunity to be able to do yoga at home, at my convenience. It was also surprising to see how I wanted to go back to it every day, since I'm not into sports at all! To be honest, Dedicate felt a bit tough, so I did try some other teachers on YouTube, but it never felt as comforting or joyful. I think it's your positive energy that calls me back to the mat every day, so now I'm back to Dedicate, however tough it may be. As much as I can do is how much I'm expected to do; that I get from your encouraging comments.

I really enjoyed this video and I just wanted to tell you that when you started naming all the 30-day yoga programs you had released, and you said that Yoga Camp was greatly inspired by affirmations that your mom taught you growing up, I felt a little mad because I have had and still have, a pretty problematic relationship with mine. I felt as if it isn't fair towards me. But then I stopped and thought, what is there to be unfair if you are sharing the positive forces that impacted on your character being shaped? :) When I thought about it that way, I cried a little.

186.0,"Thank you for posting these videos. I finished your other 30 day yoga challenge a couple of months ago, so I was really excited to see that you started a new series. A friend took me to my first yoga class over the summer while I was visiting her in another city. I really loved it, but couldn't find/afford lessons close enough to me in my city to make in-person lessons a realistic option. Your videos have been great for learning yoga. I really like that you take the time to explain sensations, breathing, and poses so that I can ease into everything without feeling lost and wondering if I'm doing things ""right"". I do weightlifting and cardio 3 times a week, and then practice your videos on my rest days. After finishing your other 30 day yoga challenge I noticed a huge improvement in my physical wellbeing and performance during my other workouts. I feel much more aware--and in control--of what's going on with my body during weightlifting, I have better control over my breathing, and I'm much more balanced. The improved breathing control has been especially beneficial to me while running or doing other cardio. I've also noticed a decent amount of improved flexibility in areas of my body that are very stiff for me, like my upper back and hip creases. Your videos have really helped me improve my physical wellbeing, and made regular yoga lessons accessible to me, so thank you for that. <3",UgxCfoGIbMU5CDsdc_14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-08T00:26:29Z,0.9981564879417419

276.0,"Dear Adriene, i joined all your 30days journeys and i love them and i love you and honour you for the way you embody feminine leadership! There is one thing missing for me tough, which is menstrual cycle awareness. Most of your followers are women, and your yoga journeys are exactly 30 days, meaning women who experience their cycle regularly, will bleed during this journey. It would be wonderful and a great gift for womankind, if you would mention this and bring awareness to it, and mention that during our bleeding time and the 1,2 days before, we should take a gentle practice, no bandhas, no inversions, a day of total rest or yoga nidra day one of the cycle, allowing a day or more of break from the journey etc. We are trained to function, work etc 365 days a year, wheter we're bleeding or not. I think in the yoga world thats a big problem and it needs to be adressed that women shouldn't do vigorous yoga practice 30 days a month, that can harm our bodies and minds seriously.
So, i would be grateful if you use your wonderful voice to bring awareness to this, or who knows, maybe the 30days journey 2020 is designed cyclical... lots of love to you, thanks for shining your light :-)",Ugz-036g7AQdboFqATV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-12-31T04:19:17Z,0.9979850053787231

286.0,"I have learned a lot from you, and I'm looking forward to learning more with your new series! I'm currently experiencing an unbelievable amount of irony regarding the timing... I've followed along with each of your 30 day series in the past, EXCEPT the original ""30 days of yoga""... *until* I felt randomly motivated to start on the last day in November. Here I am, 30 days or so later, and as I'm finishing the last episode of all your previous serious combined, you have a new series coming out the next day!

Irony is one way to describe it, but partly thanks to your teaching, I'm much more prone to believing that everything happens for a reason now ; )

I look forward to continuing to practice with you into the future and I hope to someday thank you in person  - not just for the resources and lessons you have provided me with, but also for the mindfulness and thoughtfulness which you bring to your practice that enables me to share your videos with family and friends of all kinds!

Enjoy the New Year Adriene : )

I was hoping to help my physical, spiritual and mental self. I live on a farm so going to a yoga class was not available for me. But then I found your Yoga community. I feel like I have a gift greater than anything money can buy. I can roll out of bed, wear whatever and do it in my lounge room with my dog (Nugget) each day.

495.0,"Hey Adriene, sounds great, I started yoga back about a month ago after a 10 year break and I think this is what I need right now in my life (along with my usual other sport practices), for my back problems, for my anxiety, etc.I like to do some yoga before bed and Jesse, my dog, falls asleep while I'm doing it, so sweet. I'll try to introduce some in the morning too when not working.
So eager to begin my 30-day-of-yoga journey!

649.0,"this has been an incredible yoga-year... Last january I loved the journey so much that I sticked with the practice through all year, thanks to your beautiful daily yoga playlists, and the september-challenge. I did yoga almost every day since then and it changed my relationship to my body, my posture and my emotions so much... This year I'm looking forward to ""dedicate"" myself to me of course, but also to others, to open myself more to the wonderful people that share my life on a daily basis and share a supportive and simple love with them, as I usually am a kind of individualistic (?) person, overly self preservative. And I want to integrate more meditation on my yoga routine ! The effects are huge but I'm not very comitted with this for now.

Ok this was unexpected but I think I needed to do this little check-up, just to say : thank you for initiating this path in my life, Adriene, and thank you to all the community <3 have a great celebration time !",UgywiN80gdwKDqUXKUV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-12-24T08:29:00Z,0.9993446469306946

Thank you for creating and sharing these journeys, in January and all year round. 
In two weeks I will be leaving my home, family, friends and everything I know to live and work in Southeast Asia for a few months. I'm very much looking forward to my new adventure but I am also so grateful to know that I will have this practice to guide me through and anchor me if I start to feel lonely or overwhelmed.

Thank you for your light. My light honours and respects it. Namaste and happy holidays!

If not now...when?  Something to consider going into 2019.  ""Dedicate,"" is the theme of the journey Adriene, from Yoga With Adriene free YouTube channel is about to embark opening up the new year.  Based on her YouTube channel, even after the 31 day  journey, the relationship and new weekly videos are free.  If you are looking for an even deeper relationship and prolonged exploration Adriene also offers, what is known as, Find What Feels Good, a community of generous human beings who Adriene supports and is supported by.

Below are the links to the entire playlists of 30 day journeys created by Adriene the past 3 years...watch some (or all) of them and decide if the DEDICATE theme is the direction to reinvent ""you"" in 2019.
