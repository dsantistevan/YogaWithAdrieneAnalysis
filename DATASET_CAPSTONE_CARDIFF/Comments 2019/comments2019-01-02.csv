My impatience is something I need to work on. I almost quit this video half way through because of the pace but instead I took our lovely leaders advice and made this practice my own. I moved when I felt the need to move. My mountain had a soft sway today with just a touch of boogie woogie, down dog went to plank and back a few times. I moved with my breath and intention. That is what is so great about a home practice. It can look however you NEED it to look that day! So much love and thanks from the bottom of my heart! I felt the worst shake when I pulled my elbows in during halfway lift. Now there's some muscles that don't get much attention!",UgyWjIKhY7VVQuzvQCx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-11-01T17:19:48Z,0.9954684972763062

215.0,"I finished Home two weeks ago and my goal then was to find more of a connection with mind and body. I definitely felt more connected to my mind. I genuinely felt like I returned home to my true self. Quarantine took a little while to get used to, but I got the hang of it and the 30 day Home challenge helped as well. 

I haven't done yoga in two weeks and this happened around the same time that lockdown is being lifted so my daily life is starting up again and as I finished all my exams/assignments for school that kept me busy for months. So I've felt a bit disconnected from how I felt before. I had wanted to start a new yoga journey in those two weeks but couldn't get myself to start. It was really hard and I don't know why. What you said at 47:18 about spending time with your true self, essence really resonated with me and I started tearing up. It was hard for me today to be kind to myself and to be focused. But at the same time I'm excited to start a new 30 day journey and to set a new goal for this one. To really connect with that true self.

Today is my 32nd birthday and although I am safe and well, I am feeling for the many injustices of the world right now, leaving me more sorrowful this birthday. It is okay to feel sorrow on my birthday. For Home I focused on reconnecting with my physical body after feeling that I had mainly used it as a vehicle for at least the last decade rather than upholding it as the beautiful instrument that it is. For Dedicate I am intending to love myself. This is partially in response to struggling to find lasting, connected, loving friendships in adulthood. It seems that I am not able to womanifest such friendships, so maybe I need to take that bounding love and desire I have been trying to share with others and direct it inward. Thank you for holding me accountable everyone, as I know that you will. Sending you love, light, and warmth, and hoping you each feel the freedom to love yourself.

During this yoga practice I heard and felt thing creaking, cracking, and popping and it felt amazing! I knew it was the feeling of my body trying to finally start to loosen a little. I felt all my blood flowing like crazy and felt my mind connect to my body.

Home has made me more thoughtful, mindful of my body, mind, and soul working in unison, has helped my relationships - basically made me a better version of myself. 

Thank you for having all this content up on YT, it's another exemplary gesture from the sweet and thoughtful guide that you are. We are all stronger as a collective.

I cried throughout the whole practice - it was healing to give myself some self love.  I've practiced with your videos for a month already, and I feel calmer and somehow stronger mentally. To be honest, I've always thought yoga is not for me, but more like for flexible skinny girls with protein shakes:) Now I'm starting this yoga journey to learn to dedicate some time a day to myself, my mind, my feelings. I've never in my life commented anything on Youtube - but I can't be silent. I am so grateful that you exist and do what you do. I'm sure there are many people who feel the same.

Sometimes I do a short energizing practice and sometimes I do one that is a little longer and more challenging. I decided today to challenge myself to this specific 30 day yoga journey because I would look thru the channel for a practice to do and id always skip past this to opt for a shorter practice for a specific need like yoga for lower back love, or yoga for runners etc.  I‚Äôm so happy that you are here guiding us all thru these practices & im especially excited to complete this new journey!

Thank you so much for this amazing practise. I‚Äôm going on this journey with you for the second time (I firstly did it when it was live) and I find it just amazing. The way we can strengthen our bodies with love and care? To listen to our body and thoughts and emotions and welcome them rather than pushing them away?

553.0,"Thank you. I've come here after 74 months of fighting a chronic illness, and it's meant I've barely been able to exercise at all in those six years for fear of making the prognosis worse.  I always meant to try Yoga in that time, but trying to get to a class was both intimidating with how limited I was (I used to be really active) and I could never know if I would be well enough on a set day per week.

10 days ago I hit the highest point of frustration, anger, everything at everything. I'm 31, now just barely too old to qualify for a lot of the youth opportunities I wanted to try but wasn't able to. But, something changed when I hit that low. For the last week I've been filled with energy, and while I'm burning it up making plans and getting things done in my life again, I also found my way here.

I don't know now what the outcome will be. It's possible tomorrow or next week I will slide right back down to where I was and I won't be able to do all 30 days. It's possible I'll just keep feeling better and in a month I can take the steps to get back to normal life. Either way, while I have the energy and the strength I am going to give this everything I have. Whatever the outcome, I'll post again when I get there.

I will see you all back here tomorrow for my day 2.

I was umpiring Men's A Grade softball, with the pitcher pitching at approximately 110 km/hr. Unfortunately, the ball managed to hit where there is no padding for a plate umpire - the hip. I spent 2 months bed bound (a 2 inch crack on my hip bone) and 8 months of physio and rehab following. But it didn't feel like it was enough, until my Mum found this journey and told me to give it a go - she thinks maybe a slower, more intimate approach to rehab may be the best way to get me back to my full potential so I can play my beloved sports (field hockey and softball) again this year.",UgxUhmpo7oK5rZcZI7V4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-07T23:33:20Z,-0.9959256649017334

I really don't know how you do it but somehow, every time, you crack my chest open. It took me a while to come back to my mat but today I decided to show up for myself once again. I'll admit I was hesitant when I saw how long the video was. I stepped on my mat thinking I didn't have enough time and even though I love hearing your voice, I kept fidgeting during the beginning. But I stuck with it (because I am worth it) and after fighting against my body for about half the video I decided to just let it go. I stopped comparing how weak my body felt now to how I used to feel before I took a hiatus. I have to tell you I don't think I would've gotten to that point without your sweet sweet words. Every time I felt guilt or shame or anger at my body, you were there with an encouraging word or kind statement to help me through and shift my perspective. The tears came during mountain pose when I finally felt myself surrendering and they continued throughout the rest of the practice.

927.0,"I'm a 43 year old guy who was told by his doctor that I either lowered my stress levels, or I would be dead. She suggested yoga. As my main interests in life are heavy metal and causing mayhem, I thought she was crazy. However, I didn't want to be dead so I signed up for classes and it blew me away. I learned that yoga is about a lot more than stretching. I also made friends with everyone and they all saw past my leather jacket and black jeans to who I really was. I eventually moved from the east coast to San Diego and signed up for yoga here. Unfortunately, my job started late, so I had to wait to sign up full-time. After a hard day, I was on the interwebs looking for something online to take the edge off, and I found this.
What a find.
You are honest, open-minded, and funny as heck. Between saying things like ""jibber-jabber,"" ""I'll kick your butt later,""  ""PHSSHEEEW,"" ""Bells and whistles like Bugs Bunny,"" ""That's the title of my fourth book,"" and actually singing a little at one point, I found the main message here to be ""You are NOT alone."" At one point I went back to the beginning and put this on surround sound and turned the TV off.
So I know this was just the beginning, but I have a feeling that this is going someplace good. It's nice to have so much commentary because it helps me really think about doing things well and comfortably (and get out of me head). Thank you for putting so much work into this.

 You are my HERO.
 I read to know more about Yoga and know what it is to start practicing because everybody now a days talking about it here and I was interested .
I looked for online practicing and you are the first one who I started practicing with and I'm so proud and happy in our journey, as new beginner that couldn't open my chest, shoulders, back and all the way down to foot properly,.... as I do it like you now :P:P and I enjoy all the moments ;) 
1 year practicing with you online, home made me happy and comfortable with my self and body.

I tried different types of workout and sometimes find myself hating my body even more after each session, because I tend to focus on things that I couldn't do. This here is different...it is about creating space, it is about taking care of myself. You asked me why have I chosen to start this 30 days journey...

The practice yesterday made me fall in love with yoga and I have both you and I to thank for it.

Having realized that I had been far too sedentary over the last few years, I decided that it was time to get off my hind end and get more exercise. Right now, I'm only doing yoga a few days a week, although I do plan on eventually doing it every day. So far...my lower back has been feeling far better than it has in years, and my mood is improving (I've been quite the grump for a long time). At 54 years of age, my body has been through a lot of abuse thanks to several jobs and a definitive lack of energy that kept me from getting up and moving on my time off. I had decided after a recent visit to my doctor that I really needed to push myself to get back into shape and get healthier. Stumbling across your channel was a fantastic catalyst that helped me get into gear. You present yoga with a calm manner without being pushy, and you inject some humor and silliness into it as well...which I like. I'm so glad that you have taken the time to help bring yoga into my life. Thank you, Adriene.",Ugzeb6wGHu6ZHTWZJxZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-17T16:03:30Z,0.9912773370742798

I've recently had a lot of big changes take over my life, and the past few months have felt like a blur of anxiety. But before that, I'd been ignoring my practice and letting all the bad emotions rule me.

So I came to the mat today, halfway through the month, just hoping to stretch it out. But your words and your grace and your kindness brought me to tears. I'm tearing up now just writing this.

1369.0,"Hello Adriane and friends,
First of all thanks to this channel, I have been following you for some years and I have practiced many of your videos, doing my routine with them and I love it.
This is the first time that I have proposed to do this Yoga journey, although I just started because the first week of the year I was on vacation in total disconnection and the second week with the flu.
Today I finally got up with all the desire to start the 30 days of Yoga and I was thrilled to see that this first video was almost 50 min (I said: Perfect! Just what I need after so many days without moving).
But honestly I could not connect or enjoy the practice since I got distracted listening to you talk all the time, with so little movement and long transitions until the next pose. I understand that these videos are for all kinds of levels, but I felt there were times when it was not necessary to talk so much (And I want to make it clear that I love your voice). I almost changed to another video but as I decided to do this I finished it, but I ended up frustrated and feeling bad for not having enjoyed the practice. If I had more time, I could have made another video that I like but this time it was not possible.
In any case, I still love you and I will continue with the second one, hoping that I can focus better and feel good, this is the main reason why I practice Yoga. Namaste!!!

Sometimes that's all the reason you need to do something big. I often end up saying out loud during practice ""Gosh that feels great"" and today I even said out loud ""gosh I love my body"".

1637.0,"Love, love, love your mindful approach to this practice.  :)  How you always honor and respect each person and their uniqueness; and as a guide and teacher give them the permission and empowerment to choose kindness, gentleness, and patience toward themselves, rather than a rigid process!  It's awesome, not just for yoga, but for everyday life.  <3

When I first started out trying various fitness practices I never expected the moments of emotional release that would come from some of them.  This, and also in a tai-chi one, I must've hit on something that I was holding inside, because it definitely hit me for a little bit.  Amazing.  :)  Thank you for sharing a window into your perspective and practice with us!  I'm so glad my friend referred me to your videos some time ago, as they have helped me through some harrowing times, already.

With that important stuff mentioned, on a side note, I also wanted to toss out a possible suggestion.  Sometimes I watch these on my television, and cannot turn off the auto-play feature.  So, when the video ends, it is a bit abrupt when it starts into the next video in queue (or worse, possibly a  loud ad).  This causes me to jump up to stop it when I really should be still in the calm, peaceful cool-down window.  So, to account for this, I was wondering if it might be a good idea to fade into a bit longer cool-down segment at the end with some gentle music with a blank screen, or possibly an appropriate image or animation?  Although, I realize this may distort the idea of how long the session will be when looking through thumbnails.  Hmmm.  Well... yogi's choice!  Hehe. :)

Lol, okay, and another question I had pass through - does your pup always have that calm, quiet demeanor, or did you train him with peacefulness, as well!? :D  (Is it a breed attribute?)

1879.0,"Hi Adriene,
I just finished this and I am feeling grateful. Discern: to perceive or recognize something. I feel I am recognizing myself. This practice indeed, brought me back to my love~cave within. I felt incredibly safe and at peace. A peace I forget exists. But always return to. During this practice, I realized I have shifted to a new energetic time in my life. Truly, it feels like an opportunity to start anew. I usually do not resonate with new years, but feel fully connected to this new, fresh beginning. Recently I started reading a book called, ""The Courage to be Disliked"" -- it touches on Alderian Psychology. It has taught me so much, introducing me to a new subjective way of interacting with this physical world. I am recognizing myself more and more, and feel compelled to take care of my self, my growth, my time, and my physical body. This is why I am doing this practice today. Perhaps, that's interesting for you to read. The background and personal story of this individual perspective as to why I am compelled towards this lovely practice that you've provided. You are connected to my journey and my seemingly cosmic self shift and I am extremely grateful for the practice you yourself have dedicated yourself to.

It's amazing that you create really beneficial content and give an opportunity for everyone to share practice with you, connect to inner self and find what feels good. My love to yoga began 5 years ago, when I was 25 and have luckily discovered your channel. I had not very good yoga experience before - I came to Ashtanga class at one of Fitness First Gyms in London, the practice pr moralise class was very fast and intense with lady who was leading the class singing mantras and being a bit extra by rushing everyone and criticising what they were doing wrong - I thought I came across some sort of cult - and decided never again!
Then I came across YWA and absolutely love home practice. I have done couple of 30 day challenges, but during the year. I am really excited for what's coming and grateful for this experience.

For the last two months I've been practicing almost daily, and it's been amazing to dedicate time and energy to my mental and physical faculties. Last week I got rear ended on the highway by a dually. Let me tell ya, it sucks to see one of those things barreling down at you in your rear-view mirror. My car was totaled and my beloved guitar was demolished. I'm fine but for some real sore neck and back muscles. But, man, could I really feel it today. I had to get off and back on the mat a couple times. It feels like I've taken a step backwards. But I'm here to dedicate myself to myself, to getting better, to moving forward. So, thank y'all for this. It's a simple thing, but it's nice to have a consistent act of self-love that I can do to help my body recover and help my mind let go of some of the anger and sadness I feel from that accident.

I'll admit, I cried a bit when you said ""let something go"" because I had stumbled upon my cheating ex (from an emotionally abusive 4 year toxic relationship), and I felt like after working on recovering from my depression for the last two years, I was finally able to let that shit GO.

It's been an up and down couple of months, and I find myself more impatient and less present than I'd like to be. I got into yoga in August thanks to your TRUE series, and it has been such a valuable part of my life. I fell out of touch over the holidays, and I found myself feeling listless. When I saw that this was 50 minutes, my first thought was one of impatience. But I slowly melted into my own personal love cave, and I feel more refreshed and clear than I have in months.

2506.0,"Adriene i am so stoked to be involved in yet another beautiful 30 day journey with you.  I've always loved your challenges. the original 30 day challenge was PROUDLY when I began my life changing journey of becoming a yogi. I'll never forget it. 
early summer of 2015, I made a commitment to myself to stick with the challenge, practicing it EVERY DAY. I never knew It would get me to where I'm at today.. a pretty intermediate yogi. I have not skipped a single day since that first committed month. 
even through my battle in and out of my drug addiction and recovery, I've never given up. sadly I've been to numerous rehabs since, but I never ceased to bring my yoga mat with me to each one! my yoga mat is like my little magic carpet.
Adriene, thank you for giving me that push I always needed and desired. I literally got butterflies seeing you post another challenge! brings me back to basics.
today, I am over a year clean. 
one day at a time, one second at a time, one flow at a time...

2697.0,"Adriene, Thank you, thank you, thank you! I hope you have no doubts that your relentless gift-giving is giving me the tools to change my life! For years I have lived in a tense state, unconscious to my breath, and to the layers of stress and pain that I have carried in my feet, hips, and shoulders, ever since I over-committed to the whole warrior ethos of contact sport (rugby) as a wee lad (and crucially, I did so without proper conditioning, physical or mental). In recent years, I have realised I am a man of peace, and that I really want to spend my time traipsing around the beautiful American West backcountry in a kind of euphoric walking meditation. This goal has been hindered by my feet - specifically, the fact that I have for most of my life only been using half of them, walking mostly on the inside edges, while the outer edges have withered for lack of use like a tyrannousaurus rex's arms, obsolete and numb.

I signed up to your emails in December 2016, and then spent a year for some reason not doing your videos. I think I was scared - I've known for years that yoga would be good for me, but it always seemed so hard! I was used to seeing myself as strong and athletic, and I did NOT feel that way doing yoga. I felt incredibly tight, and just incompetent. But in January 2017, I started to try, and I began to learn to listen to my body, to identify where i was holding tension, and to explore new movements slowly and while observing what effects arise in all the different parts of my body. In September 2017, I committed myself to daily practice with your videos, starting with the TRUE journey. I have occasionally read the message boards and noticed that everyone's positive comments had a buoying effect on me; making me more confident and determined, and even fooling me into thinking I'm not just doing this alone in my girlfriend's mum's living room while her dogs stare at me, all quizzical and bemused at this lone yogic nutter. 

TLDR: This video is a beauty! So good to go slow and learn some new things about moves I rarely take the time to think deeply about now. In particular, I had an epiphany about moving between downward dog and forward fold - who knew how much sensation you can experience in the feet during this transition! Rolling deliberately through my feet helped me feel rooted, while also stretching more deeply through my back. Surprisingly for me, this video was not easy, physically, even though I have been gaining strength and control practicing Adriene's core workouts for a while now. It took work to strengthen my breath control, and to move through the poses while keeping my shoulders loose and relaxed.

At the end, I felt so light and loose, and deeply present in my movements. I almost didn't want to get up. Does anyone have any wisdom to share about how to maintain that mindfulness and ease as you move through your day? How many people who practice daily in the morning also practice in the afternoon or evening? If so, what does your second practice look like?",Ugz8KggaSAGCwUsnyut4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-02T20:35:14Z,0.3924855455721614

2808.0,"I paused the video around 43:00 because I had inspiration to write, and wanted to share what I discovered: 
""How slowly can you take 2019? We are constantly told 'Carpe Diem' or 'Seize the Day,' but I feel that puts a lot of pressure on you to go out and do EVERYTHING in that moment, as if you have no time. What if you woke up each day and just took it at the pace you wanted to? With your breath, taking everything as it comes and feeling the space to be creative rather than panicking about what you're not doing or accomplishing? 
This year I choose to not feel guilty for going my speed. I choose to enjoy where I am and always remember that the choices I make have ripple effects that I won't even think about, to make them really count toward what I believe in. Spread the love, spread the steady and the stable, the logical, the honest, the genuine. 
You are your actions.""",UgwSfw7ANrN17L1LT1J4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-02T19:13:58Z,0.9941321015357971

Started out with yoga with you 2,5 years ago - which changed my complete life from being chronically sick, tired and depressingly overwhelmed to now becoming a yoga teacher myself, changing my whole career towards mindfulness and sustainability in eco travel and consumption and a inner world that's so much brighter and happy and a healthy body. And still tearing up of gratitude towards you, as with you - it all started. Will never be able to thank you enough.

So much love to everyone around this beautiful planet! It touches me to be united on this journey in connection and peace together.

When Adriene was talking about the busy mind, or distracting thoughts and how to work with them, it reminded me of a video I saw of a Buddhist monk saying that the part of your mind that is distracting or sending you thoughts can be seen as the monkey part of the brain. And what do all monkeys need? A banana. So your breath is the banana. And you just say to the monkey ""Here you go monkey. Here's a banana!"" I like it cause it makes me feel less serious about distracting thoughts and turns the idea of centering my mind to my breath more of a playful game. Thought I'd share heehee.

3236.0,"I started doing Yoga with you 2 years ago now, but this is my first time following the 30 days of Yoga live, and I'm so happy to do this. This year is a pretty special one for me, it's already my fourth month living abroad and only now I'm starting to get back to have a routine, to get back what was part of me and in between those things there is Yoga too. 
From the exact time I came to China I felt like there was no time to dedicate to myself, no space since I live in a little room with another person, no will to give myself a pause. But then I realized that rushing that much not to lose the time here, I was loosing me, my body, and my mind. And this is not right, you can not build anything if you don't have a strong base that keep you up. And so today I choose, I choose to get back to the origins, to me and to find what it feels good, because one hour is not that much, because even in a 5 meters of room you can find space if you want. So thank you as always Adriene, for being here, for what you do. Because even when I am 8000 kilometers away from ""home"", I can feel like home doing yoga, cause the real home is just when my mind is at ease and I am one with my body and mind.

3432.0,"Wow Adriene. First of all thank you so much for this practice and for the journey entirely. 
This time last year I participated in the True Journey, and honestly it set me up for greatness. I was true the whole of 2018, with myself, others, my passions and in life. It amazes me to think where I was last year. I was closeted and insecure about myself. I was preparing for dance school auditions and the stress was a lot. This past year was a journey for myself and to now see myself happier than I've ever been, dancing in a very good university abroad, out and proud and radiating love everywhere I go. It's a crazy thought and I 100% believe that my journey with yoga (so actually with you) has helped enormously. This practice I was proud of myself and not afraid to be. I choose to be proud of myself, my body, my mind and my abilities and limits.

3458.0,"Every few months, I come back to this channel and tell myself I'm going to complete a 30 day challenge - one of my goals for 2018 was to be able to do the crow pose properly and for longer than a few seconds of wobbling! Didn't happen! But 2018 was a hard year with lots of trials and very few tribulations, and this year I'm determined to start it off right! My partner recently had a not terrible injury, but it's to his hand, and it's completely changed the way we've both had to view the world and our capabilities - you don't realise what you've got until it's gone, and he's lost a lot of his fitness-based activities because of the pain and immobility in that hand now. So I feel like I owe it to him, as well as myself, to actually act on the never ending ""I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna get fit, I'm gonna do this that and the other"" and actually achieve it. And I think, with the endless smiles I find my face covered with whenever I watch and engage with one of Adriene's videos, I'm going to make it happen.

3616.0,"I started my morning very agitated. I started the video that way too and I could feel the anxiety, so I was worried it would spoil the experience. I paused the video, took a couple of minutes to lit candles, get a cover, brush my hair. And continued. And landed. 
The first vinyasa was so calming. It immediately soothed my nerves. It brought me a strong connection to my breath and attention to sensations at each movement. 
I didn't see the 50min fly by. I was so in sync' with it all. The Ujahi breath. The opposing lifting and grounding forces. 
I was meticulous with the entierty of my body, laying each finger and knuckle down with a dear clear attention.
I have not found my intention yet, although I really resonate with the word ""dedicate"". Each yoga challenge has brought me, in the past two years, peace and better understanding of my body and mind. I think I simply want to connect to that again.

What you are doing is amazing to get someone like me to exercise every day and enjoy it :) I've now done 30 Days of Yoga, Yoga Camp and was a few days into Revolution when I thought it would be more fun to do Yoga with the World and so have started to do Dedicate. It's quite incredible what you have managed to achieve here. I find the fantastically positive comments here online a big part of that. There is so much anger and ugliness on the net,  but here the opposite. I did Yoga with Daily Yoga the app for a while, sometimes 'harder' but YWA is altogether something different: enjoyable, playful, fun. ""No Yoga Robots"", ""Peddle it out"", ""Take your Dog for a walk""..its all those little things that make it special. So Happy New Year to you Adriene and everyone on here. I'm writing this in County Down, Northern Ireland. Do Yoga here and then can seamlessly transfer to London where also live.

As my practice continues to evolve I want to start understanding that this is a journey and that some days I feel weaker and my yoga might need a slight adjustment and that that is absolutely okay because in other days I might actually crave some fire. It's all about balance and harmony. 
I wish all of you taking part in this journey good luck! Don't forget to enjoy it, that's the most important part and do it for yourself, not for some expectation of outcome or anything like that.

Last year at the same time I didn't know what I was doing I didn't know who I was, I was lost, I was just a college student, not feeling anything but now after a year I feel like my life has changed. My life has changed for good and this yoga journey with you is the biggest reason for that and I can't be grateful enough.
