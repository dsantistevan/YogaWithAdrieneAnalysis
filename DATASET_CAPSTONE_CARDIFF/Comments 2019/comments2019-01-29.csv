The last three days of this journey are really important. Thank you for being here.

37.0,"So today was not a good day. I came downstairs before doing my yoga practice and overhead my parents talking about how badly students have done in their GCSEs and A-levels this year (the corona pandemic - yay!). I'm getting my results in less than a week and to know that I'm probably not going to do very well, or get the grades I was aiming for, was gut-wrenching. I started the video and for the first time in the five months I've been doing Yoga with Adriene, I burst into tears. Somehow, this video was the perfect one for me today, the one I needed to acknowledge my anger and disappointment, and let it go. I'm still sure I'm going to be upset on the day, but this practice gave me the tools I needed to cope better with my feelings. So I dedicate my practice to anyone out there who's feeling angry or sad or disappointed - I hope you find the peace you deserve. Thank you everyone - we're almost there!

Today was my longest entry so far, and it's only fitting that it is the ""Dedicate"" practice. Adriene, thank you so much for all that you do with this community, you are truly inspiring and helping so many people. I never thought I could get into yoga a few months ago but here I am going through an entire - dare I say it - spiritual awakening. I really am on the path to righteous self-discovery and it is through your videos that I have been able to find the strength to do so. A little nervous to be commenting this as one of the major things I struggle with is other's opinions of me - so putting this out there for potentially anyone to see is scary. This community is so accepting, if you took the time to read this, thank you. 

Also wanted to add - my dog Bailee came up to check in on me as we did the pulses/breath of fire and it made my heart melt. Love seeing Benji interact and check in with Adriene too. Extending my love to you all! Namaste.",Ugxi-NmQSj4jgY8FKwZ4AaABAg,1.0,11.0,2020-07-15T15:15:03Z,0.999056875705719

150.0,"Okay, time for constructive criticsm. 
I have done the challenge so far and I thank you for giving this opportunity. Yet, I have a few points that I feel hold this or would hold future series like this back: 
The last session was the first where I felt pace and difficulty were at a good balance before that everything was a bit too easy even for a total beginner. I think a slighty higher pace also makes it easier to go with the breath. 
Then the thing that I think is least helpful, is how much you talk. Don't get me wrong I like the instructions and I agree with a lot of the things you say about the more mindful parts of yoga. However, you talk probably 70% outside of the instructions, a lot of it repetitive and it sometimes seems you cannot stop yourself talking and let a mindful silence be. In future videos maybe trust your viewers to find that mindfulness themselves as you cannot talk it into them and when you try the opposite is achieved - frustration and the inability to connect to an inner calm because somebody is constantly talking. I hope this was not to harsh but I really feel that especially in yoga and mindfulness less is more.",UgwmX2JYli7-ZsBcVWV4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2019-03-17T08:07:36Z,-0.8119794130325317

The last 27 days have NOT been a waste just because I couldn't keep a ""perfect attendance"" record. This practice, day 28, was just what I needed to get myself back on track. I am beyond happy to say my dog is doing really well... I don't know what tomorrow will bring, but today is a good day. Needless to say, I dedicated today's practice to my furry pomeranian companion, Lola. Keeping my own stress levels down, will be of benefit to her in the upcoming days.

I've been going through a time in my life where I feel I've always done for everybody around me and never for myself.

It did make me notice that I do lots of love in and lots of love out but only to the ones that haven't ""wronged"" me or more accurately the ones I don't feel have stolen my time from me by always needing me.

YOGA WITH ADRIENE
One glorious morning checking out my YouTube.
The 30-day challenge showed up.  How I would look like a boob.
I do not remember.  I think I subscribed.
To check it out later I would probably need to imbibe.
After a few days of this the idea within did foment.
I decided to do it on the spur of the moment.
In the middle of the day, I thought let‚Äôs get it on.
Kind of like an interaction akin to the film Tron.
It was a bit of stop and go at first.
As if I was entering a race at Bathurst.
Slowly it became a part of my morning routine.
Organizing one‚Äôs life like this doth make one a queen.
Now it is meditating on waking, put on my Gamma & Beta binaural beat.
Then switching on Adriene for a physical treat.
I don‚Äôt need a coffee now until long after seeing her place.
It is a joy having made her a part of my disciplined space.
My arms are starting to look a little buff.
I exercise now without needing to puff.
Even my buttocks is starting to gain a touch of shape.
Polygon it is not though I would look good in tight shorts and a small cape.
As for Benji who an upcoming epic Blue Healer.
How blessed you are to have an ethereal energy transmutation dealer.
I am not wealthy enough to send money to you.
A poem of gratitude with good energy is the exchange for my Yoga Guru.
Adriene I thank you for the changes I have chosen to allow you to help me to make.
You have helped me to connect even stronger with my inner Drake.

As a hard working mom, who recently finished nursing school, I have always kept my workouts, prayer/bible reading, and meditation to a time when it would least impact my family, so that I could spend as much time with them as possible. This meant that I was doing these things while they were asleep or in school and don't see me in these activities. Doing Dedicate 30, I have been fitting practices in my day when they happen to be around, mostly because this has been a change of practice for me. Because of this, both my children and husband have begun to incorporate extra activity into their days.
