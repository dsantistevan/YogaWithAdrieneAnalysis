414.0,"Today was tough but also satisfying! I found it very fun to play with more challenging variations of poses we've been working on since the beginning. It was awesome to see how much the knee to nose table top variation had grown and likewise with chair and warrior 3. 


As the rest of my body has caught up strengthwise, these last couple of poses have finally started to properly challenge by strongest muscles aka glutes and thighs. I'm noticing that I'm activating them in all sorts of posture now as well as in every day gestures. The bend over the sink first changed in that I had a flatter back, then a more actiavted core (and so a flatter back) and now I am activating through the legs as well. This has made some of these everyday gestures much more comfortable and also it's nice to feel myself building strength in these moments too.


But man now that my legs have joined the party they've joined the soreness party too. The bound forward fold was ouchy today as it stretched out some hardworking muscles.


All in all a very satisfying practice.

424.0,":) I'm personally celebrating the fact that I didn't give in to my own sense of laziness and showed up in the 11th hour to do this. I'm being consistent, which is something I've always struggled with when it comes to working out; I get sore, give myself a day off and then a day becomes three days. So, yay for that!

Also, while I am terrible at standing poses, I was better this time around--which is good because it's exactly what I was to work on.",UgxMqC3dhwoG5ZpAjc14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-03T07:48:16Z,0.9986236095428467
425.0,My quads were burning a bit today between running and this journey...but sooo worth it! Really enjoyed the challenge of the final sequence! I also learned today that it's okay to have some negative feelings of frustration and impatience. I learned that it's important  to acknowledge and validate those feelings before trying to move past them. Yoga helps move through these challenging emotions very nicely :),UgzovNmNHsc9bAegLFt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-03T00:10:38Z,0.9997794032096863

I told a friend's secret yesterday and regretted it the second it happened. I've been living in a state of self hatred and fear that I've lost her today. I was suppressing all those feelings untill I started the practice, it flooded out. It helped me so much today to celebrate myself. I know she'll forgive me but just needs some time and in the meantime I can't live every day hating myself for breaking the friendship. It's okay to celebrate. We are worth it.

709.0,"I have been doing yoga for over a year and still can only do beginners levels.  I have tried to do more vigorous classes but can only handle 10 minutes before I completely loose energy and flake out.

I like this 30 day series as you have picked it up to next level without beasting me although I still cannot do standing poses for long as my knees hurt.  I am not overweight or anything and class myself relatively fit but I don‚Äôt know why I cannot handle more energetic classes.  I am peri menopausal and want to feel like a pro but often feel useless if I cant connect to my inner self and then often give up if standing poses are involved.  Other days I feel amazing especially doing yoga flow because the pace is flowing without being too fast.  sometimes you talk too long causing me to loose focus on connecting.

I also still find it hard to connect to core, I know I should do more exercise for this but I do love how you incorporate this into your class.  Especially where you get the mind to connect to it then the body, it really sets the stage but how do I do this all the time when i have very little core strength to begin with?

Can you please do more moderate classes for people like me?",UgyBIo2m80QE0vIVwft4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-31T13:02:14Z,0.9882243871688843

755.0,"There have been several days throughout this journey that I have had to double up some sessions. Today was one of them. Having Dedicate and then Celebrate on the same day, back to back was really powerful. A few days ago I lost a childhood friend to stomach cancer. Her husband and 3 children are now in the midst of this heavy loss. I dedicated this practice tonight to her and her family. And I found that having celebrate immediately after allowed me to focus on celebrating the life we have in this moment. Each breath was a celebration of the life that her children have to hold onto. The celebration of the love we get to share with each other and need to remember to do every day. Thank you so much for this and for getting me to get back to my mat.

When you offered DEDICATE, I knew I had to embrace the entire enchilada... challenge myself to stay with it, not miss more than 1 and making up the missed one the following day by doing 2, which actually was nice so have a longer workout and more time spent with you and Benji! I am someone who gets all gung how and then I just trail off, feeling oh so shitty about myself for quitting. NOT THIS TIME! I am so super proud if myself for sticking with it that I am sad it is over tomorrow üòî. But I know you will have more 30 dayers, so YAY for that! And I just have to say that I think you are just the most precious human on the planet and YOU make this journey of practicing daily yoga so much nicer, better, sweeter, FUNNIER, dog lovinger, easier etc etc etc and makes me want to show up just to hang with you and Benji! One final story....I am a human/dog trainer and your love for Benji and all creatures is a page out of my heart story. One class Benji was pacing at the window, making me feel almost anxious, so I was saying to the screen, ""Benji, settle baby, settle, go lay down on the blankie"", and his next move was straight to the blankie and BOOM, down he went for a few calming minutes!

1020.0,"I absolutely loved this practice! It is one of my favorite of Dedicate! It made me feel so happy and lighthearted! Personally, among the other things, I celebrated the fact that since a while now I do the ""extend and squeeze"" while keeping my balance all the time, while when I first started yoga some months ago I was all wobbly, and I would wonder if I'd ever manage to keep my balance with that üòÇ
I also loved hopping and dancing around on the mat, it was so fun! We all need to let our inner child out like that from time to time! üíï
I must say half of me is already starting to feel nostalgic because Dedicate is about to end, but the other half is so proud of myself and all the yogis who came this far, going through this journey together!

1294.0,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! I'm eternally grateful for this practice, this 30 day journey, for your channel and for you. Just after last year's TRUE, I found out I was hypermobile and my doctor said I shouldn't do yoga anymore. I was heartbroken. I cried. I took a bit of a break from the yoga mat but after about a month I decided to ease my way back there. And it was like a whole new practice. I was so much more aware of my body. I made sure I didn't overbend my joints, I listened to my body the way I always should've listened to it. 2018 was a year of figuring out what yoga meant to me, and about finding what truly felt good for me and my body. Starting out 2019 with Dedicate has been magical and so beneficial. I enjoy yoga so much more now and Dedicate has taken my practice to a whole new level. I've been doing yoga for 6 years, but I was doing it in the wrong way before.  Now that I truly know my limits and what truly feels good,  magic has started happening on the mat. I see myself making remarkable progress and my mind is calmer than ever before. So thank you, Adriene. Thank you for teaching yoga in such an accepting and loving way. Thank you for Dedicate. <3",Ugw1JR863DUxv2eLblB4AaABAg,5.0,37.0,2019-01-30T08:26:10Z,0.9992990493774414
