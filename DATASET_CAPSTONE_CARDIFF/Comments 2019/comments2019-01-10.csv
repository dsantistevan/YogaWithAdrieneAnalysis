I wondered if anyone has any inner pelvic floor burn when doing yoga sessions? I will be 54 in a couple of weeks and mid menopause.

As we are in the throes of a huge transition on this planet and being flooded with divine feminine energy, my whole right side has been stiff and sore and a bit stuck. I think I may have just a few things that need letting go of and healing. Even though I am feeling the 'stuck' energy I engaged in everything. When Adriene said towards the end about how we are told what to look at, where to be, what to eat, it made me cry. The Truth of that rang through me. I so look forward to this great awakening we are all going through at this time and to experience our new earth and our freedom!

147.0,"This practice is sooooo beautiful, reminds me of my Buddhist teaching. Every being has that enlightened element within them, and what we need to do is dig them up and recognize the divine in each other. When you do so, your relationship with others will automatically improve, as if you see the divine in others, you respect them more, love them deeper, and all the hatred or bad joo joo will be defeated without much effort.

I'm a musician and I used to do yoga three times a day, even teach yoga, but a long period of time I lost track of both music and yoga two core important things for me. Lately I'd do yoga for 5 minutes or 30 now and then, but never allowing myself to _really_ connect. Today I wanted to be true to myself and I decided to put on some music to this class and somehow it felt almost like a mindful dance with and for myself. The vinyasas felt smooth and honest and I could go deeper into poses like I haven't in years. I was angry and sad before I started and I forgot all about it. I was just here. I felt so true to myself and open to something bigger.

219.0,My cat did come over when we were doing that breathing technique! He was rolling all around on my mat and being all lovey-dovey. I don't think he's ever come over to my yoga mat and sat or rolled around on it. I thought it was odd and then Adriene mentioned (once we were done with that part) that if you have pets they'd likely come over when doing that breathing technique.

Today is the first day it flowed and my body and mind met and knew where to go and just wow.

I did something that i was not allowed to do and someone told me about it...i took it very calmly and  was very gentle afterwards..very calm and I thought yeah they are right...so I kept silent...happy with myself when I thought the way I would have dealt the matter 8 days ago which could have been bad..

But yoga is helping me   to know more about responding to such situations...

I want to tell you if u have difficulty in taking things lightly and understand fully the matter with calm...try yoga..it will help you to have a good day..

I intend to put this video in with my regular practice because it has been the first one in a long time that has gotten me to feel TRULY connected to my TRUE self - the one that is not constantly trying to look a certain way or do things perfectly - this one has allowed me to forgive myself, wipe my plate clean for at least the entire video, and just focus on breath and movement that feels good in my body. I feel energized in so many ways right now. Like I've taken that energy from the muscles and pushed it deep into the center of my spirit. Thank you Adriene.

777.0,"For anyone wondering ""Are there really people practicing all around the world with me?"", think about this.
When I watched this video, it had been out for 18 hours, with 82, 914 views.
There are 64800 seconds in 18 hours.
That means if you watched it, someone else was definitely watching with you (it might have been me).
Chances aren't bad that they started watching it the very second you did.
And that's not counting all the people doing yoga who aren't watching this video.
And that's not counting all the people who have chosen to be mindful of their breath, of the present moment.
And that's not counting all the people simply breathing at the same time as you, whether they're aware of it or not.

I was ready to go to bed and I suddenly remembered I hadn't done my yoga practice for the day and yet instead of just going to bed which I would normally do. I WANTED to do it. I was...excited isn't the right word but something along those lines (I'm exhausted sorry I can't think right now). I was happy. Every practice has made me feel so happy and peaceful at the end. I'm always happy once I start the video. As soon as I hear Adriene's voice it just puts me at ease and I know I can let go for this entire video and just follow her voice. I'm on holiday right now so I am free and at home doing the day and I'm not stressed or anything like that but I don't know how to explain it. I just feel at peace I guess.

942.0,"""This too shall pass"" is something that keeps popping into my head during this journey.

On the 1st, a glass pot lid exploded on me and filleted a hunk off my finger. I was in a car accident a few days ago. An unexpected bill popped up which puts me way under budget. What feels like a lot of unexpected and unavoidable bad news has appeared for me in just this last week.

The way I have begun to see it, it already has passed. The finger is healed, it just hasn't (fully) happened yet. The car is already fixed. I just haven't experienced that moment yet. Even these 30 days of yoga are already complete, it just hasn't come to pass yet. I'm still living in this moment because it's worth experiencing.

On the flip side, I have received a sudden flood of good news. I landed a part-time job at a dog daycare place. Chill with dogs for work? Yes please. I'm a freelance animator as well. I received word that I have about 4 great gigs coming my way very soon. I met with a drummer and another guitarist. I'm finally getting a band together!

This too shall pass.

How will I handle that? When the good news also comes to pass, will I move through it with grace?

I haven't in the past. I think this is my time. This is what I'm dedicating myself to understanding; all things good, bad, or mild will move on, and I can choose to handle it with grace and ease or I can let it dismantle me.

That's my long comment for the 30 days!ü§ò",UgyMyooz4qogizh8_gB4AaABAg,2.0,25.0,2019-01-10T19:33:42Z,-0.9854250550270081

1113.0,"After having a child 2 years ago I've really struggled to get back to my yoga routine, I suppose mostly because I struggle to give myself some much needed ""me"" time. Also it has been difficult as I had become pretty good at yoga before pregnancy, but back then for me it was more about power and strength and pushing myself to be the best in the class. Thanks Adrienne, this has been a fantastic way to ignite my love of yoga, i have realised it doesn't matter what others are doing around me, I should be proud of myself for showing up, being kind to myself, and investigating how my body works now I've gone through change. I love how accessible this has been for me, I can pop my yoga in between toddler naps, and I'm building the confidence to get myself back to classes after our 30 days are up!

1260.0,"How I loved today ! I feel so full of energy... a beautiful life-energy running in my veins <3
Today, I kept noticing the sky as it changed from night blue to a flashy marine blue; almost surreal, to a light purple, and now a nice clear morning blue. I smiled as I thought to myself ""I'm connecting to the skies, to the highest colours I can perceive"". I choose to let this blue light lift me up today. 
I love Thursdays. Thursday is the day I get to do my relaxation activity on the lunch break with the kids at school. I have a group of 15 children, from 6 to 11  years old, who spend an hour with me in an introductory session to meditation, conscious breathing, yoga, and then we end with massages and a discussion (of which they choose the theme). I love spending that time with them. They are so... real. They don't censure themselves, they try anything and everything, and they are curious and fast-learners at these ages. 
Anyway, focusing back on this practice, I noticed how my toes now automatically do the opposite of griping on the mat, by lifting. I remember one of the first video I watched (Yoga for Back Pain), when Adriene said ""Notice your sensations and thoughts, you will want to remember where you started this journey"". I'm amazed at the increased mindfulness I have, noticing parts of my body I used to ignore where even there ! I am sooo full of love and happiness today ! I send it in thoughts to you, people. Know that waves of positive energy are coming you way ! Pass it on, if you may, or cherish the thought, cherish you own smile <3
