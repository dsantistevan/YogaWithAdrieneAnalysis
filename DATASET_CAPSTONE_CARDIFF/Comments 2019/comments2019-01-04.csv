0.0,"Hi everyone! It's DAY 3 - OBSERVE! This workshop style session is full of GEMS for practice & life. Be patient. Use this time to practice breathing deep and dropping in. Your role is to reside with the breath and observe, no matter what. The practices pick up as we go along. So take advantage of this class time now. (And breathe!)

Love you,

i‚Äôve done two series of 30 days of yoga with Adrienne this year, and somehow I slipped and stopped doing it one day. as I've come back to feel the joyful experience of yoga, to connect my mind and body, and to strengthen myself through these flows, I find it hard to catch up. I feel like I don't have the energy or the flexibility to do this and had 3-4 days off between the second day of ‚Äùdedicate‚Äù to the third day.
altho I didn't feel like it, I stepped on my mat and observed my mental chatter about not being strong enough. hopefully, I will dedicate these remaining 27 days with the rest of the people doing it all around the world.

The explanations go significantly longer which whether deliberate or not lead to being in postures for a lot longer - but essentially losing my rhythm as holding too long gets too boring & hard and I find  myself losing motivation / getting ancy as I want more of a flow.

288.0,"Notes from the field: A lovely Saturday morning here in Austin.  I am on day three stretching before we go on a family run.  I am doing my deep breathing with my two girls (7 and 9) running around playing/screaming, two ferrets running around wrestling and our old lab mix puppy trying hard not to eat them. My husband is in the open kitchen doing the dishes.  On my first cobra stretch I look down to see something under the mat and discover old dried ferret poop.(I store my yoga mat in a corner in a bag with my weights pad, but who knows what goes on in the corner by the couch.)  I peel that off and calmly place on the tile floor and ask oldest daughter to come remove it. Later when you are discussing spreading honey on my mid torso I hear something thump next to me. My husband has thrown a bottle of honey at me and says ""I'm in"".  I finish my practice and continue my day in the peaceful way it started. :) PS, the weird structure behind you in the video we have a debate if it is a deer blind :( or a tree house :)",Ugw5_ZqHxlEjKETmjjt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-30T14:41:56Z,-0.9652948379516602

342.0,"As an avid Adrien fan of course I am doing this 30 series. Although this is definitely not for those who like a continuous flow.  Seems like she talks as much, if not more, than the actual movement. For some more experienced it may be frustrating but for beginners I think it is perfect. I did find myself getting frustrated at times when she chattered on for too long about a pose that we were working into and then pause extensively during to redundantly explain more and then the timing for working on both sides would seem uneven. I have some physical limitations due to health issues but have always found a decent amount of benefit from yoga.  It was a lot more difficult to hold poses for uneven times (ex: she starts to explain a pose to move into and then stops half way through it several times to go back to a point she's already made several times)  or extended times while she explained things at length.  It did certainly test my patience and remind me to bring myself back to present and focus which is always good!",UgwBaJkTA0YAwyqadqp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-02-23T15:10:54Z,0.9946869611740112

371.0,"Day 3... After missing two days of this series (I still did morning yoga on Friday and bedtime yoga yesterday). Today I observed... a lot of anger. With each pose and each breath I felt it and to be honest, I wasn't fully present through this. The last two days have been tough. On Friday I was in a very minor car accident. It snowed (it rarely snows where I'm from) and I slipped into a ditch. Physically, I am fine. Mentally and emotionally, I am shaken up. Despite the fact it was minor it added a layer of anxiety to the past two days. After someone pulled me out of the ditch and I got home, and then tried to venture out a few hours later to get to work (even though I'd be 4 hours late) and I find out I did more damage than initially anticipated. I could continue with the play-by-play but long story short, I have been stressed. I did it though and I made it and I observed that it was not anxiety I have been feeling today but anger. Hopefully that recognition will let me release and when I come back tomorrow, or maybe it won't be until day 6 or 7, I will be able to reconnect with my body and experience how amazing I felt after day 2s practice.

I love the balance of seriousness and sillyness, but joking around while halfway between pose X and pose Y is just frustrating. I didn't know what to do when ""smearing honey"". Was I supposed to smear it back and forth or just once and then reach towards the ceiling or stay in that twist? Too much sillyness between poses just causes confusion.

Yoga is my outlet for stress, yet I think it is causing more to stick it out with her....As much as she talks, this series should be advertised for very out of shape, very new, or not really wanting a workout to individuals.

I‚Äôve always been shaky with tree poses, definitely opting for the ‚Äútoe on the ground version‚Äù...and stumbling a few times with that as well...but doing my best not to look down. I challenge myself to raise my gaze higher, and my eyes go to the mirror on the wall facing me. It‚Äôs an old-style mirror, with a mirrored rim around the outside, so above my reflection is another strip of reflection that is slightly off from the main one (wow, I hope you can make sense of this). The mirror is lowish (no, I‚Äôm tallish), and so what I see when I raise my gaze is my eyes looking at me from that narrow strip...but the eyes looking at me are also exactly where my third eye would be in the main reflection, if the mirror was just a bit higher on the wall. So I am looking at myself from my third eye. And suddenly my whole body relaxes into the tree position and I find my balance. I was able to breathe comfortably, and was even able to raise my toe for part of the time. Pretty poignant experience.

671.0,"What a thrill to see that 1,394 yogis-in-training accompanied me this morning as I observed the sun rising over Tokyo along with this beautiful Day 3 practice. I am a couple of days behind because my college-age son, who has been struggling with stress and anxiety, checked himself into the hospital, afraid that he may not be able to go on. This is a child who had always done everything ""right"" -- and ironically, as his academic star continues to rise, he finds himself increasingly unhappy. I want to rush to him, to be by his side, but he has asked to take this journey alone: some time on his own, with none of the noise of school, friends or family, or his devices, to get grounded and find his inner peace. I am grateful to anyone who reads this -- you are among the first that I have told of my deep, quiet grief and worry. Tears shed on the mat this morning, but I feel ready to face another day. Sending this peace out to my son, and to any of you that are similarly struggling. Namaste.",UgyTwQ7gXP-fCEZbml14AaABAg,4.0,0.0,2019-01-06T21:43:45Z,0.9492686986923218

I have a quick question about positioning that I struggle with in many of your videos and yoga classes - unfortunately I have a really difficult time getting my heels down during downwards dog so I'm always on my toes.

I noticed that for today's pulses you said to get down on one knee but was wondering if you had any other advice on how to make adjustments to make that position more comfortable (or if there's something I could be doing better to get my heels down!)

During this year I found out that I was hurting my elbows during yoga. It turns out that I hyperextend them during planks or downward dogs. Apparently if you keep your biceps contracted it prevents hyperextension. So I was mindful of where I was active within my body.

It really kicks my practice up a notch. And your analogies and visualizations definitely help me with checking in with my form. LOL the smearing... but that really helped me to open my chest up more fully. And the visualization of ringing a bell was a great reminder to reach higher with my hand to get a deeper stretch in the pose.

At the same time I looked forward to this all day, and then hesitated about getting on the mat because I felt worn out, sad, anxious, angry, hurt, frustrated... I felt I was too tired and would not be able to do it. But I did. I showed up on the mat and there you were, guiding me through this practice which was just right.

This practice was AWESOME, I LOVED the moves, the pace, the breathing. I have learned: the energy during the Mountain pose. First time I hear and feel this. 
During the practice I was looking forward writing you, so much I was grateful for it ! :) 
I had taken some yoga classes during quite some time, but it's been months I had stopped. I wanted to practice at home but it was only procrastination or at best few moves during 5min. 

But thanks to your YouTube channel, since few weeks I'm enjoying practicing Yoga again. 

At first I wasnt sure I liked the videos, the style of yoga. But everytime I was coming back to you. I guess it meant something haha. 

When you launch the video to introduce these 30days Dedicate practice, I didnt know if I would do it. 

But now that I have done the 3 first days (or 4 :)), I m so excited and glad. It feels so good. 

That s a good gift you are sharing and that I'm giving to myself for a great start of 2019! Btw Happy New Year ! :) 

Difficult to imagine 30days in a row, quite a challenge in term of commitment for exercising but it looks appealing. 

Gosh this message is so long haha. Two more things. I'm all for kissing my knees and caressing my belly with a soft substance.

1045.0,"Thanks for all your help Adriene. I discovered your TRUE 30 day yoga back in August, and I did 26 days in a row. Then I had to drive 40 hours across the country due to destiny haha, and so that stopped my yoga journey for some time. I didn't continue again until maybe 4 days before December 31st, and I finished the last 4 days of TRUE then. On day 30 where it was all instrumental/meditation music for the yoga journey, I was very much weeping gratitude hahaha, what a sweet and rewarding journey. Thank you!!

I noticed someone in the comments mention how these first 3 days have been weirdly challenging (Frankie Simmons). I agree! Day 1 and 2 really got into it! I have not done day 3 yet but I""m about to now. So different than the TRUE 30 day yoga experience! I also did your yoga for scoliosis video, which was basically one of the TRUE videos and I absolutely loved it. When the video started with you mentioning a towel/blanket for a lift I was like, ""yesssss she gets me"" hahahaha so thank you! I love all the variety of videos  you have, such a beautiful gift to share with the world. 

This has been a central component of my healing journey, and so I'm just in eternal gratitude for myself and you as well as everyone who is showing up here around the world. Thank you Adriene, I love you and Benji so much! You are a fantastic being and I love your light. You're very conscious to not offend others- not that I think much into that, but there was a topic I was very sensitive about when it comes to sexuality, and naturally with yoga being about all parts of the body, you had made a comment about something and I did not feel rejected which made me appreciate you even more haha. That is a more random side note, but just the vast amount of acceptance you hold for everyone on this journey.. I just really appreciate it hahaha

Thank you!

In the past as soon as I'm unable to do a pose or 2, I quit the video and say ""I'll try another day"". But guess what? I don't come back the next day then. 
It's important to remember that it's not about doing everything perfectly but what is an improvement for yourself. Even though I felt like I was ""lazy and couldn't discipline myself enough to finish poses"", I did stay to the end of the video, and my muscles are shaking which means I DID work hard. Don't compare yourself to others, your body is at a different place and you just might not be able to hold a pose at this point - that is NOT giving up. What's giving up is not showing up again tomorrow because of that. If you feel it in your muscles afterward, if you feel mentally clearer afterward, even if you still feel like crap but completed the video, you did not waste your time. You will come back tomorrow, and you will gradually improve. This is only the beginning, and like Adrienne says, the most important thing is to keep showing up.",UgzVELOWNN-8E4f0LhF4AaABAg,25.0,673.0,2019-01-04T20:37:07Z,-0.984672486782074

*LOTION*, Adriene! Hahahahaha I just kept yelling 'Lotion!' while you were trying to think of something. 
I was feeling silly today so I did things that made me laugh during the practice such as: 
1. Making little rollercoaster noises when we did any rolling up standing poses and then putting my hands in the air and yelling ""wheeee!!!"" like I was at the top of the rollercoaster. 
2. Twerking my way from downward dog to the front of the mat. *hey-ohhhh*
3. Used my cat as my drishti, which resulted in a cat-human staring contest (I lost). 
This was fun! And I tried to close my eyes during tree pose which had me swaying and falling, but then when I closed my eyes in mountain pose I never felt so still and grounded!",UgxDU3dNHz3J0FGl9ix4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-04T20:26:53Z,0.8576695919036865

1171.0,"Yoga allows me to assess and improve my body mechanics, what I often refer to kinematics (something I became more aware of during my 3D modeling days when animation had to work out inverse kinematics).  For that to be effective, I have to listen honestly, which in turn, requires a bit of humility and curiosity.  The conscious mind can be (and usually is) very distracting to that listening. And I have a very busy conscious mind. I think that Adriene does a great job of showing us of what we should be listening to and for, both mechanically, and spiritually. If I find her jokes annoying, or I find her references too ""girly,"" i have to remind myself that while that may be true, it really just means that I'm not paying enough attention to what I should be, that I have to get past all that, and remember who the teacher is and why I'm trying to be a student in the first place.  I've done yoga before, and I got back into it a few years ago when I discovered 30 Days of Yoga‚Äã. I stuck with it, and was impressed at what I got out of it. 

I have to be in the right mindset in order to successfully practice yoga. But that's the point. If my recovery was just about physical therapy, I'd be outside jogging, or hitting the gym.  But my body isn't quite ready for that. You can't race a car that's hasn't been tuned, not without ruining it. I can't just assume that there's something wrong with me. I need to listen quietly to find out what is wrong.  Mentally, that's a challenge. But physiologically, there are tangible signs. Like how I breathe through certain movements, or how my body feels while doing them. I can ""feel"" those symptoms. If I'm tight, I can loosen up. And, as each day passes, with each session, I can feel the improvement. The downward dog I am cringing through today will feel more natural (hopefully) next week.  My conscious breathing now should eventually feel more natural and intuitive later.  The steps that my mind has to go through to affect my body are the same steps that also affect my mind as well. As yoga gets easier and more comfortable, it should be easier to listen to myself, to listen to what's going on in my head, and not just my body.

Earlier, I described the difference between want and need. Want is something you can usually identify pretty quickly, with a pretty strong emotional response. Desire.  Need usually isn't so easily obvious. Want is identified by the conscious mind. Need is defined by the subconscious programming. We want a million dollars, but we need air to breathe. With a busy/distracted mind, we often confuse need with want, necessity with desire.  And there is nothing wrong with want, as long as needs are being met.

I want to run again. I want to climb rocks and fall out of trees again. I want to rebuild my motorcycle without being too exhausted or in too much pain. I want to go skydiving with my 360 camera. The frustrations of my current limitations make those wants feel like needs, because my physicality defines who I am as a person. But before any of that can happen, needs have to be met. My body needs to heal properly. And my mind has to be open, patient and willing for that process. Yoga alone isn't got to ""fix"" me. But it helps me find the mindset I need to choose the right path. It allows me to work past the frustrations and desires and distractions, and focus on what actually needs to be done first. 

So far, it's only Day 3, and as you can tell from this post, the brain is still busy as ever. It's still an effort to tune out the noise and tune into the practice. It's still not as fun as I remember it in the past. The future still seems so impossibly far away. But I still got up this morning and hit PLAY. I groaned, I laughed, with both Adriene and at myself. I'm taking notes. I falling out and catching back up. I am realizing. While other F words come to mind, I will say that I am finding the Fun in this daily challenge. And I look forward to taking what I'm learning it, and exercising it throughout my day, until tomorrow, Day 4. In the meantime, I'm celebrating surviving this episode with a shot of Fireball.

So, I started working out about 1 1/2years ago at the gym. While I was getting the results I wanted in my body, I found myself constantly worrying how my body looked, comparing myself to others I see on social media. I saw that this mindset was extremely toxic, and decided to give yoga a try. That‚Äôs when I found you about 2 weeks ago! Even though I‚Äôve been working out, I was still struggling, getting sore, and did things I never thought my body could do. Even though it‚Äôs only the third day, i‚Äôve learned to be patient and kind with myself and my body, to love myself no matter what, and most importantly, to be present since i have so much trouble with that.

1259.0,"This will be a unpopular opinion. But I have to say it.
First is: I like the old place better, it felt cozy, nice, but mostly humble and sincere. 
Second: I see this channel is getting huger and huger by the year. That can be a good thing, but i have something aganst western yoga, seemingly doing the opposite of what you and all spirituality is about : lessening the ego and greed and wants for earthly riches. The views alone generate thousands of dollars or more. Then there is a membership to pay for and then there is even merchandise that is being sold.
I must be honest and I know am not like many, just following blindly. I speak up when needed to (i feel) and say its harder to follow your voice even for this 35 minutes now, since i feel like its doing the opposite. 
I go back to the old videos where I still felt sincerity in the voice and surroundings.
I think there's a reason there are thousands of white people making yoga videos, and very few Indian OG yoga practitioners doing that. Sincerity is the most important thing in this world and I felt you had that and that you Adrienne are graced with privileges that help you reach a huge audience. I wont say donate the money to the needy and do what you preach, but I will just say that the western way of individualism and hijacking every spiritual movement and almost anything that is sacred for the use of even widening the ego is something that is. Im against that and i will miss this. This was once of the few things I had..dealing with 4 major illnesses and trials i had in life that most people wont even believe. Anyway.. yeah. Namaste. Check your light sis and try to keep it. The room might be better lighted but i think i watched the video because of your lightness.

1464.0,"You made me fall in love with yoga. All those years I have been trying different types of exercise. And quitting them. Because the motivation was always something outside me. I wanted more definition, better looking body, more flexibility‚Ä¶the exercise was just a means to a goal. For the first time ever I am coming back to my mat each day without trying to do more, be more, achieve more, be better, be something that I am not. For the first time the purpose is yoga itself. The purpose is being in the present moment as it is, which is love. I don‚Äôt think I would gain this perspective without you. Because human beings can use even such a beautiful thing as yoga as a way of forcing, trying hard, judging what is, judging the body, its flexibility and strength. With your guidance I learned to bring all of myself to the mat. To allow all what is coming up, whether it is good, bad or ugly:-)To witness it, welcome it and love it. To fully experience the moment and its fullness. The abundance of all things. Strength and flexibility are just icing on a cake. But it is journey that matters.

With hiking I am using a brace, but that isn't possible with yoga. Do you have any advise what I could do in these positions to avoid the pain and cracking of the right knee.
