19.0,"I just want to say thank you for this practice, especially today. I flew on short notice from my sweet small midwestern town to the NY metro area (where I grew up) yesterday to help my mom figure out care for my declining dad. I left my little old farmhouse by the creek, my autonomy, my dogs and cat, all the meadowlarks, my man, and the beautiful sunsets (I love the quirky home I have created). It was a strange day yesterday...some very kind people in the flights and airports, and some viciously unkind and even bully-ish. I think the masks make some people meaner in those big public places...has anyone else noticed that? Anyway, the night before, I had received some slightly negative feedback from my supervisor, after putting in 11 hours of work, and was discouraged. Through all this...and waking up today to face a lot of unknowns and my old low self esteem that I thought I had conquered long ago, I hear Adriene's wise words. Make space, open your heart, take your time, be in your body and pay attention to how you feel (aka: don't numb out), the body is a metaphor. Today I might be making space for something new that might not be very pleasant (seeing Dad in the nursing home for the first time, and knowing that my brilliant, funny, kind father is no longer working with a full deck...or even with a full suit), but who knows, right? Maybe a new job is in my future as well...thank you for this lesson. I feel courageous enough now to truly be open to whatever today wants to bring my way. Thank you and I love you all (especially Adriene and Benji)!! <3",Ugws0KNiBpesRBhE7KV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-04-22T12:37:57Z,0.996637225151062

Being in grad school is a lot, but I truly want to find a way to feel better physically and mentally, which is what this practice is helping me with. One thing I really appreciate is the kindness that is brought to us all watching in this series, but especially today. I struggle with not thinking that I am enough, and its kind of healing to hear that I am. I am going to finish this month out strong, finish this series out strong, and hopefully create a loving, powerful yoga practice going forward. I do have a few questions for anyone reading this though! 

First, how is everyone finding balance physically? I find that since my body has been thoroughly inactive for a while, I am having trouble balancing in the poses. Any tips welcome!

Second, anyone have any good book recommendations related to yoga, the third eye or any spirituality? I am a semi-practicing Buddhist, but I am the first to admit that I could be better!

I started dancing few months ago, I always dreamed about it and now I am grown enough and independent to find courage to do it. And it is a lot of space-taking in contemporary dance! I am tall and have long limbs and I do struggle with allowing myself to take space in movement, because I was raised in the society where women should restrain themselves from taking space to be accepted and loved. In the class, no one says anything, everyone are learning and there is plenty of space, and still I don't let myself take space, as if there are extra walls around me.

I hope you all have had a wonderful start to the new year. I just want to share how incredible my time with Adriene has been in the Dedicate 30 day program.  I greatly appreciate how fresh each day is and how Adriene is always mindful to tell us ways to protect ourselves and enjoy the practice. I never thought I would be able to incorporate yoga in my daily life, but through sick days (where I'm doing a session on antibiotics at 11 0clcok at night because some days fly faster than others), sunny days (where you don't want to be in the house,) or even chores/work days, I fought hard to make this precious time a part of my day. I feel better, my body feels better. I struggled with basic poses like rag doll at first. However, I find know I can be present in the pose and not feel the stiffness or awkwardness that was tempting me to stop this journey. I wanted to share this with you all because I know I appreciate hearing how others are experiencing their journeys. Keep it up! It's so worth it!

I was carrying my 40# sleeping kid up the stairs to my apartment this afternoon and felt that all too familiar twinge in my hip as I tried to compensate for his weight on the opposite side. But then I heard your voice in my head, ""don't crash into that right side..."" so I tried engaging my core instead. And do you know what?? IT WORKED. I can't describe the relief and love and deep sense of victory I had in that moment, as my body was there to catch me when I needed it.

766.0,"It was wonderful to do Day 13 today. I woke up and even though I had meditated and gotten ready, I was dealing with difficult emotions that stems from coming from an abusive family. Anger was burning within me. I had to go out, and thought I would do yoga afterwards. I saw Adriene hearted my comment from yesterday and I felt good, and thought, ""Let's give this a try."" At first it was difficult, but by focusing on my breathe, I let go of some of what was not serving me. Goddess pose was amazing. I love it when I tremble. For me, when dealing with that PTSD anger, I need some of that. When I tremble like that, I burn off the energy and afterwards I feel good and great.

I dreaded waking up and to relished more sleep under the cozy blankets.   But since committing to do yoga daily and meditating almost every day since June, I've just recently become a morning person.

836.0,"Thanks soooooooooomuch for making these videos.
Would you consider making like a yoga camp day 30 to 60 to keep building?
I have done yoga camp twice, revolution twice, and true once.
I love the compassion and self love hour long classes paired with one of your 30 day practices.
But lately I‚Äôve been doing more and more sometimes 2 or 3 hours a day,
While they are still immensely enjoyable I feel like I only break a 20 or 30 min sweat.
Sometimes I use your hour long shakti course it always breaks a sweat.
Perhaps a 30 day series based around the intensity of the shakti course?
I normally don‚Äôt like to jog or lift weights to sweat but your classes help me to love love love the sweat!
Sometimes it feels so good afterwards I just have to sit in awestruck feelings instead of spending my time continuing to practice.
Also would it work against me if I was to eat a banana before practice?
My dietician advised me to eat in the morning I usually don‚Äôt.
But I understand to keep an empty stomach before some yoga.

I can feel the blessing i've been granted, of having such a kind beautiful loving guide as Adriene sensei is. I know thousands of people who are doing or will do this practice right now feel the same way. Thank you for being by our side through this challenge as always. The practices are magic spells in and of themselves, and the guidence, is the recipe to the magic. Keep pushing everyone. We are almost to the moon. Can't wait to get a taste of that half moon practice on day 15. Much love. Peace",Ugy55Qn3QmcgS85-AD94AaABAg,0.0,6.0,2019-01-14T06:58:41Z,0.9995920062065125
