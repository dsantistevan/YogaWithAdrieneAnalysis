0.0,"Daily at-home yoga provides the most incredible opportunity to get in touch with all parts of your self.
It provides us the time and space to commit and re-commit to being a student of life, of art, and of the world.
Never not learning.
When you start to think of your practice through this lens, everything changes.
You are able to drop any expectations and judgement and just focus on the learning.
The experience.
Live, learn, and lean in!
I hope you enjoy it.",UgzdLNrYXmqZzgghmL54AaABAg,12.0,380.0,2019-01-18T13:57:54Z,0.9994112253189087

I'm honestly loving this journey, I've missed about 2 days but have otherwise been consistent. Starting out, I realized how much I loved this as opposed to HIIT workout/weights but I find myself wondering if I should incorporate some other form of fitness + daily yoga. I wish I could do both back to back but it'll take too much time. So I might just split it between morning and evening

All that isn't to say that I'm doing this for weight loss primarily. The mindfulness and meditative aspects are amazing. Thank you again Adrienne.",UgwQWZUcGXed5rUzLwB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-09-24T06:43:25Z,0.992097020149231

But better late than never! Most days I hurt when I awake in the morning, I 52 soon to be 53 this year. I have done exercise in the past but it has been short-lived due to pain then complacency sets in and I am back where I started.  So far with yoga, it's been challenging but makes me feel good. Must be a spiritual element to this that is helping me. Thanks, Adriene for being such a great mentor.

178.0,"I am depressed (again). 6 months ago I started taking an herbal remedy and discovered this channel...I thought I was finally free, finally in control of my own emotions. Even my father who is a doctor asked what I had done to put my decades of depression in remission. I credited the herbs and the tools of yoga. (Now I know that was not the case, as I have not changed anything in my regiment. ) During this period I became engaged with things I have not done in years, but now I must find a way to disengage.(Example: I joined a string ensemble, no showed for two weeks of rehearsal, force myself to go last week, and now I can’t imagine how I will go again tomorrow. Especially considering the fact that I feel worse every day) It was amazing, and now that it’s over, the dark is even darker by contrast. I am on my 4th consecutive round of yoga camp. Although I am back in my all too familiar hole, For the first time ever I’m trying to rage against the dying of the light, so to speak. While I’m on the mat, it’s a bit better but the negativity has eclipsed everything . It’s awful. Yoga is gloriously powerful, but NOTHING can conquer the dark void of depression.  Please do correct me if I am mistaken. (Please.)",Ugz9hULTP5mxYA1Amox4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-04-28T18:46:43Z,0.5063462257385254

267.0,"Soooo good to be back 😊❤️ so nice to resume  that beautiful journey. And I come back at the exact point where the practice motif couldn’t come more timely: 

« Student of life, never not learning »

Just before the session, I sent a lovely answer to an unbelievably aggressive sms I got yesterday.

Fortunately, I waited, and by waiting I could see clear:

My dear friends,
aggressor-victim are usually two sides of the same coin: victim today, aggressor tomorrow.

That’s what “naturally” happens unless deep and consistent work is done, carving the path of forgiveness, love and joy.

We’re beautifully on track here 🧘🏻‍♀️😊🙏❤️

My answer to the msg expressed that delicate tune of not being passive neither aggressive, it was assertive:

“Hi, good morning. I appreciate your opinion. However, as I told you before, aggressors will be neutralized. If you want to contribute in a constructive manner, what I’m looking for is...”

A respectful response came right away 💖

✨✨✨ So... we’re here dedicating and learning, we’re collecting plenty of tools to set the world brighter. 😊✨✨✨

282.0,"I appreciate the humor today (and throughout the series). And the reminder to be kind to, to love, to communicate that love to the body. As a kid my natural tendency was to slap my forehead, hit a leg for missing a shot, be critical and condemning of my body for failing to perform into my 20s. Yoga has taught me how to love and be kind to myself - which is not the same thing as selfishness, but which is a love for yourself which frees you to love others with understanding, because you love them ""as you love yourself,"" which is well.",UgzuLFHscgPuK2ZLmdZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-02-06T14:03:57Z,0.9994120597839355

Now I am happy to just do the practice and I'm proud of myself for letting go of added commitment. I do that a lot to myself.

I finally did this year, but had to take a few days off.  between  Dedicate and PiYo, my elbows were a bit achy and I realized I was hyperextending them in plank, side planks, and down dog (hyper flexible joints). I took a few days off after day 16. And returned to day 17 on what should be day 20.  Imagine my joy at the “take as long as you need to finish the 30 day challenge” comment since I had been giving myself grief for having to take a few days off the first time I made it almost three weeks in. Instead of being bummed that I’m now off schedule with the challenge, at least I’m going to finish the challenge.

And so much Thank you for the Mary Oliver poetry 
that came with the notification today, 
a beautiful adequate reminiscence

But little by little,
as you left their voices behind,
the stars began to burn
through the sheets of clouds,
and there was a new voice
which you slowly
recognized as your own,
that kept you company
as you strode deeper and deeper
into the world,
determined to do
the only thing you could do—
determined to save
the only life you could save.

715.0,"Long time subscriber, first time commenter here but today’s practice really filled my cup. It’s probably overflowing and it really has to do with the mini-discussion about Do What Feels Good and Find What Feels Good (well, and Boyz II Men.)

I’ve found the YWA practice so motivating because of the FWFG mantra. ‘Find’ puts us in charge; it requires us to get to know our body and it’s strengths and weaknesses. It requires that we take ownership of our practice as we seek out what works for us. ‘Do’ carries more of a commanding connotation. It doesn’t carry the same compassion. I remember early on in my journey, I would force my body to get into poses, often ignoring my breath becuase I only wanted to do what Adriene was doing, but as time passed I found there is much more empowerment in finding so thank you encouraging and empowering us through these 30 day programs and free daily

Varying arm positions in stretches or slowly moving into well-known poses, finding relief. The tabletop stretches were sooo nice.
