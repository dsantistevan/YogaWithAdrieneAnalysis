15.0,"Dearest Adriene, I started this practice in 2019 with the tribe as I was in internal struggle and external turmoil.  I struggled to stay with the practice but returned to it each month, striving to complete 30 consecutive days.  So many Truths are revealed in your work for which I remain in awe and contemplation.  Dedicate was (and remains) an invitation for me to tune in to Spirit.  I believe Spirit was (and remains) seeking my attention on deeper truths.  My son was killed 3/10/2019.  One of my last video chats with him interrupted my Dedicate practice.  Each time I return now, sweet memories of that brief conversation return.  I return this month to Dedicate my life to being the best version of myself.

I felt it and allowed it and the shaking spread to my pelvis, then spine, then shoulders. Ilet it happen knowing that my body was shaking off something. I experienced a lot of trauma in my life and had briefly loooked into TRE before so I understood what was happening and said thank you for the surprise gift. After about 10 minutes I stopped the shaking by extending my legs.

But then I realized that I still have my goal of being healthy and that I wanted to make a true change to my lifestyle.  Not just saying that I wanted to change without putting in the work that is necessary.  So here I am again.  Ready to recommit to my health journey and to be kind to myself.

171.0,"It's been an interesting few days. The things giving me the most trouble so far are my hamstrings/the tendons behind the knee being tight or short. That's not a surprise given how inactive I had to be the last few years and that even when I was younger, fitter and way more flexible I never could stretch that space too far.

The second thing is breath.  In my case when to inhale and exhale. I studied different martial practices a lot of my life, and they mostly taught exhale on the large or powerful movements and inhale on a reset or relax. So I'm having to catch myself over and over when I instinctively try to put the breath pattern the opposite way round to what you are telling us to do.

Adriene, day 4 was a challenge for me. Worked from nine until noon. Met a new energy client today. And then went to school rather long exhausting day. As you stated this is a very valuable time Practicing yoga for the people from around the world they’re not actually in the room with you but I do feel the energy from all those that are taking part in this yoga. That’s what feeling is to me.

367.0,"Adriene, you teach beautifully. I've tried other youtube yoga instructors and I felt like their main goal was to show off at how flexible they were & although they would say ""do this if you're a beginner/ new to exercise"" they didn't take into account the ebb and flow of our everchanging energy. 
The way you are non judgemental, and express that every day is different and all that matters is showing up for yourself makes me feel very grounded in the practice. Other things I really like about the way you guide the class is your vocabulary; very easy-to-follow explanations (eg ""a juicy piece of fruit between your chin and chest. You don't want to crush it""), funny quips, and a light sprinkling of spiritual/yoga vocabulary. It feels like a conversation with an old friend, or a warm cup of tea.

We had to do a self-assessment project, where we had to do any kind of intervention on ourselves to see how it affected our biopsychosocial selves, so I decided to research mindfulness, and oh man, did it ever change my life. This was in December, so I started this whole mindfulness journey for myself to help manage my severe anxiety. At the beginning of January, I told myself that I wanted to further expand my mindfulness journey and start doing yoga, so that I can not only feel better on a psychological level, but on a physical one as well.

My mantra, as of late, is ""one day at a time"". I am going through a challenging time, but I am still in a good place and blessed with support. ""Dedicate"" is a reminder that I need to take each day as it comes.

642.0,"First of all: thank you so much for this. The last two-three weeks, I’ve practised every day and I really feel like it has helped me greatly though the holidays and helped me gain perspective on a couple of things regarding my life right now. I also love reading all the comments, because it’s so obvious that this channel actually brings so much joy and positive change to so many people’s lives. Second, I have a problem, or rather, something I notice about myself everytime I have a period like this where I’m doing yoga actively, and it’s about body image. I would say that in general, I have a pretty healthy body image. Sometimes I have kind of down periods where I am a bit more insecure, but on a day to day basis, I’m confident in how I look. I don’t care that much about what I eat as long as I know I’m covering everything my body needs and I don’t work out that much regurarly, which usually I’m fine with. I love to do Adriene’s videos because she doesn’t preach about working out to improve your body on a superficial level, but instead about taking care of yourself on your on terms, in your own time, and do what feels good to YOU. All this I love, bacause I feel like I really need to hear it from an instructor to not be scarrd away, I hate gyms for this reasons, it’s not really an environment often that I agree with. But still, even if Adriene has such a healthy perspective on all these things, I have noticably gotten more and more aware a out my own body the last few weeks, and not in a good way. I know for a fact that I’m healthy, but still, I now spend more time looking myself in the mirror, with critical eyes, than I would do before, when I only practised yoga maybe once a month (busy lifestyle you know). And I know for a fact that this is not yoga in itself’s (nor Adriene’s of course!) fault, it’s more like when I start doing things like this, working out, it switches on a button in my brain that... makes me a lot more self-critical? And it doesn’t happen when I’m on the mat, then I’m feeling powerful and in tune with myself, but afterwards, suddenly these thoughts that I’m not used to are creeping up on me, about my body. I can’t figure out why this is, but it has happened a bit before when I’ve been more active, and I haven’t been able to properly figure out ‘what it was’ before now, when suddently this way of insecurity hit me right after I started this period of working out every day... this ended up as s long message, and I don’t really know if I explained it well enough or what the purpose of it is, but I guess I was wondering if anybody had experinced some of the same or have some advice on how to cope with this in a healthy manner and instead really embrace self love?",UgwESpXxulpCPQcDFK54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-06T20:50:55Z,-0.08529941938899979

I struggled with the first 3 days and was reluctant to get on to the mat this morning (yes, I’m a day behind) but while I worked through this this fabulous sequence, I realised how important that struggle was to get rid of the negative mind of ‘no’ and ‘cant’ and instead to trust you, the process, my breath and body. And yes, to feel. Today, I definitely can! Tears welled up when self massaging the base of my skull, I roared with laughter at your advanced yoga move in savasana then sobbed for 5 minutes at the end while I let out the negativity and allowed the love of you and all my fellow YWA followers to wash over me.

I did have to stop during the heart lifts because I was really feeling it in my lower back rather than my core. I have such a weak core, so I believe it to be because of that? However I did as much as I could push myself to do and I keep surprising myself every day on the mat. 
So proud of myself for already doing 4 days, since last year I got the flu on day 3!

1040.0,"This was totally not what I expected it to be. I felt a little sick today so I am late for practice (again, I will aim for a morning practice tomorrow for once). Then I got a phone call right at the beginning and one right at the end. At the beginning I shortly thought about starting over, but I was hesitant because I am not all well yet and thought I could maybe not manage. But now, after I finished, this was just right. I got two breaks in my practice, yes. But both were people calling me to make me feel proud, loved and grateful. And that is also important to feel. Maybe this was what this practice wanted to give me and it needed some more help than ""just"" yoga.

1154.0,"Today I felt quite vulnerable and it almost made me quit since my mind was immediately like „I can‘t get a good workout and muscle through while feeling vulnerable. So I better quit completely.“ I was quite shocked at the way that my mind reacted and put the video on pause to think about it.
As I was thinking about it I realised that vulnerability is an emotion that‘s quite ill-reputed. Not just in my mind but also in our society. So I took this practise as an invitation to experiment with this emotion and to get to know it better. So I accepted the way I felt and slowed down, accepting that I was shaking and falling more than usual. That was when the magic happened. I suddenly found joy in the vulnerable state I was in since it felt right and true to how I was feeling that day. It took a massive amount of pressure from me since I wasn‘t trying to act against me. Maybe the workout wasn‘t as effective but I can‘t wait to take that realisation and put it into practise off the mat, behaving in a more gentle, accepting and loving way - which is what vulnerability ultimately is.",UgxSw0msdzQHhVDBc9Z4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-01-05T13:25:04Z,0.8250954747200012

1176.0,"I have had multiple injuries due to several auto accidents. None of them were my fault! I was either hit by someone or was riding with someone who caused the accident. Anyway, I know that yoga can help with all of my aches and pains. I just have one problem....due to the severity of a knee injury caused by one of the accidents I can no longer bend my knee all the way. It stops at 60 degrees so a lot of the poses are impossible for me to do. I know it is a lot to ask but I was wondering if you would be able to do a video that doesn’t involve bending my right knee very much? Or maybe show adaptations? I just know that yoga can help me heal my body. My knee will never bend all the way again but I would love to get the rest of me moving again. Any help you may be able to give would be so very much appreciated! Xxoo",UgzXs96b9lvPBXCHD6F4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-05T12:16:17Z,-0.9361024498939514

I am not a totally beginner and I am not young. It's quite demanding for me but I can do the most of the poses and flows so far. Just a small problem with my right knee , I think I may need to change my yoga mat. Kisses",Ugycypdmcq-HITUSI-14AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-01-05T12:14:26Z,0.997922956943512

However, I feel guilty whenever I do yoga, it's always at the back of my mind. Although it does me good (I'm way more relaxed and calm after a yoga session), I feel guilty because I'm not *truly working out*. I feel like I'm cheating on my fitness, although I can already feel my core tightening and I always break a sweat during longer holds or more dynamic sequences.
