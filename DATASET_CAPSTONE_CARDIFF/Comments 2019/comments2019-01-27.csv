7.0,"Adriene just tricked me into a one legged chair pose, right? 😀 I really needed this practice today. I always do my yoga in the morning, and today I overslept, which led to me being extremely upset that I can't do it before school and having a slight breakdown. I thought about the theme word, DROP, for the whole day and slowly understood how it all clicked. Drop the expectations of a regular day. Of routines. Drop the fear of change. Stuff like this happens. I did it now, in the afternoon. Everything was so perfectly set, according to my day and thoughts. Adriene, you are a magician. Or perhaps, just a kind soul. Thank you. Also, those Benji moments were precious.❤️ Take care, fellow yogis and pets. Namaste.🙏",Ugygrfa7Ranx7T8Q6kl4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-06-16T16:24:45Z,0.9768766760826111

It's weird how the pain comes out of nowhere after practicing for 7 months. Oh, wait my wrist did do this same thing around the 3rd month. I  stopped for about a week.

165.0,"I'm baaaaaaack!! I took about 6 days off... after my last midterm I was d r a i n e d. Emotionally, physically, and mentally. The last practice (Day 25) I pushed myself a little too far and ended up incredibly sore in the oops-is-this-an-injury kind of way. I had only intended to take 1-2 days off for my body to recover but it ended up being a full on total body/mind rest with 0 studying and 0 physical activity... except for when it was 21c here and I walked down to and swam in the ocean for the first time this year... (I get off topic incredibly easily). Anyway, today I woke up with a head cold. I thought I was going to end up taking another day off but after the advil cold and sinus kicked in this evening I felt restless and ready to get back into it. I took my mat outside even though it was raining ever so slightly and I did this practice in the fading light of this spring evening, with mother nature and all her plant children coming to life around me. WOW. The STRENGTH I felt in my body surprised me! I effortlessly got my heels down in downward dog, and even though I felt my breath speed up and my heart rate increase, I felt the practice was easy & manageable. I surprised and amazed myself and again I am so incredibly grateful for this channel <3 Thank you, Adriene!!",Ugzp4VUSuS8XwqtxMuV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-26T02:28:53Z,0.9953214526176453

It also caused more pain on the other side of my body, which was compensating for the weakness on the opposite side of my body. Since then, I've been moderating the down dog, plank and other poses that require using my wrist, by going down on my elbows, or using puppy pose in place of down dog. Moderating has provided more strength and power in other areas of my body. I love finding what feels good and I thank you for your encouragement to do so!

Then at least others who need to adjust to stay true to their bods know they are not alone. (I hear that MJ song in an Adriene voice these days, is that just me as well?)

It helps me so much to learn to relinquish control to my Faith surrendering it to God, which has been a challenge for me past/present.

Modification usually in my head translates to “I can’t do the real thing, so I have to do something different from the group”. However, Adriene I very much appreciate you giving it new meaning that, “I’m strong enough and creative enough to adjust my position to do modify it to something that still makes me stronger” FWFG and keep pushing through.

I explained that it's hard to be angry, greedy and cruel if you are humble. I woke up at 3am still in the moment thinking about what poses I would have them try before I realized it was a dream.

I did this routine today with so much ease I felt like I was flying. I was doing squats with my toes lifted! What really blew my mind though was the end. I wasn’t sure where we were headed when you said don’t move your feet but turn around. When I sat back down I didn’t register at first what had happened. Then I realized we had switched sides. We changed perspectives without moving an inch. All we have to do is turn around. You’re incredible. You’re an amazing teacher and friend. You’ve helped me come along way in my life. I am so greatful to you. And Benji of course. He has very healing energy. I’m just so excited about completing this video with such ease I had to tell you how amazing it was.

725.0,"Ahh man, I feel so good having finally dropped the weight of a research project I've been assigned to do for class off of my shoulders. Time to drop them weights people, weights of things that no longer add value to our lives, and start living our own life the way we want to live it by first getting back into our own private little love cave to have some private love moments with ourselves, our minds, and our bodies, and our home yoga practice we do, showing up on the mat for ourselves each and everyday, is the way to go about that.
Doing this at this very moment with all of you strong, beautiful people practicing at the same time as me, we are so close to crossing that finish line. Let's finish strong just like we started. Thanks for the life-saving practice Adriene, truly an effective stress reliever after a long all-nighter of seated work on a computer and a great start to a new day. Much love, Namaste!!",UgySG3oVZSLTBa5nELh4AaABAg,1.0,88.0,2019-01-27T06:27:17Z,0.9983962178230286
