51.0,"Thank you Adrienne....I am so grateful for this practice today! I had been regularly (3-4 days/week) practicing the 30 day ""dedicate"" journey after doing the 30-day ""home"" journey since late March 2020 at the start of Covid.  For some reason about a month ago, I just stopped and couldn't seem to fit it into my day or didn't make time to do it, and it's been getting me down.  Today I decided to pick it back up on Day 25 (Alive) where I left off and the 14 minute practice was perfect. I'm feeling calm, relaxed, stretched, and wondering why I stopped because each practice leaves me feeling strong and more in control (at least of what I can control).  Just wanted to say that I'm looking forward to completing the 30-day journey in spite of my hiatus.  Thanks for welcoming me back.",UgwJWEaknh_kVAD-PZJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-09-27T16:40:51Z,0.9932125806808472

53.0,"It’s taking me more than three months to finish Dedicate (!) but it never ceases to amaze me that the closing comments in a video made more than a year and a half ago really speak to me on the day in the crazy future I happen to do it. Needed this today:
“I often describe yoga practice as one, of many, but one way to help guide us to find our meaningful contribution to society. And that can be frustrating sometimes because you’re like: ‘I don’t know what to do’ or ‘I don’t know’. And so today’s practice just reminds us that you don’t have to know. Just cultivate a practice of finding what feels good and continuing to follow what makes you feel alive. And surround yourself with people that make you feel alive.”

This practice grounded me today. The long day at work, picking my son up from karate. The drive home. The traffic. Being back on the mat felt like coming to a safe place where everything was cool and relaxed and happy. I said it a few days ago that this practice has become MY yoga. I feel an ownership of it that I don't think I've experienced before. My yoga = My time. Beautiful day.

157.0,"Hey Adriene,
I have to admit I have not been totally committed to the 30 day challenge. I haven't finished one since 2015. Yet, I feel this year is different in that I have finally made it to day 25. You might find this utterly ridiculous that I haven't been able to finish, but your Light has grown on me.. Your words and your constant positive vibe.
I have stuck it out this year because of it. Also I do feel more flexible and able to finish this 30 day challenge and go on to do more after. I have been struggling a lot these past few years, like most, trying to find my path. The pressure of closing in on your thirties and still having no clue is unbearable. And here you are the giver. Constantly encouraging. My morning silver lining. Helping me to reflect on my achievement of this one morning routine. I did achieve to better myself despite it all. So Thank you. I hope to stay true to you and myself through this journey, that you have made possible for us all. Namaste",Ugy64LF5KKV1Pk2M7314AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-07-10T11:33:19Z,0.9990826845169067

But I did get through the whole thing only pausing twice so I could catch up. I wish I could say I was healed like magic, that didn't happen. But I do have just a little more mobility.

171.0,"It's like you knew that this is exactly the session I needed today, but of course you did, you set up the entire program thoughtfully. You guys, I started my at home practice yoga journey with Adriene based on my mental health in mind, and figured that any physical consequence would be a bonus. At the same time I stopped drinking my calories. Ten weeks in, I've lost 13 pounds, loads of physical discomfort and pain, gained peace of mind, flexibility and muscles! I've gained visible muscles! I just wanted to leave this here, because I've seen videos claiming that you can't loose weight with yoga, but I did! Now I'm hopeful I can get back to my healthy weight goal, which is another 15-ish punds. All I did was stop drinking my calories (I could very easily tend to red wine in the evening), and do some Adriene Yoga every day, if I had a super hectic day where I didn't find time during it for a practice, I would do her good night routine in bed, then sleep like a baby.

today was my 3rd or 4th time doing this practice. 
usually I spend some time meditating right after practising yoga, but today I seemed to finally hear what you were saying as well.
quickly, I wanted to write down what it means to feel alive - both in a big / existential sense, but also for me personally. 
one text led to another and two hours later I was still writing ...
I love feeling inspired like this, so I guess this is how I feel most alive ! 
I ended up with lots of material for my future blog / book, so just wanted to thank you so much for all the effort you put into these videos AND for inspiring me! :)",UgzgSsKYH2Fd-IKUfVF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-03-27T13:51:49Z,0.9969143867492676

I did alive and found the day 25 of Yoga Camp thought should try it 

And I could  do it 💪

Remember my earlier messages can’t move from downward dog to plank and otherwise I can do it strongly now 

One legged dog front to plank and back I could do it once each side today ❤️❤️❤️

Wow can move my toes from downward dog to front standing position bent downwards 

So awesome so many victories

538.0,"Short practice, yet it's full of wisdom! I'm going to finish school in exactly 4 months and I still don't know how I will continue afterwards. Trying to find your path in life is quite difficult and something I'm strongly struggling with. Now the mantra of this video couldn't be any more truthful. Finding and following aliveness is an essential part of happiness in my opinion. Therefore I need to find something (career-wise) that makes me feel alive, something that I love doing (obviously). Although I'm still young and have so many chances and doors open for me, I feel incredibly limited and stuck somehow. Maybe that is why I'm so intrigued by yoga. By stretching my body and expanding my breath I widen my horizont and discover a new perspective. (It's late here and I'm in my teeny-philosophy mood, sorry lol), guess it's bed time for me.

595.0,"So here’s how yoga is integrated into my life off the mat...I’ve been having a little trouble with my dog lately and as a result, haven’t taken her out in public much beyond our walks. I used to take her to restaurants, hiking, shopping centers. I won’t go into the whole story but she recently had a bit of trauma that has caused her to be defensive and a little aggressive. Today I decided that I (not the dog) needed a training refresher. We sat at a busy shopping center with dogs walking about. I put her on a down/stay and out myself into deep, slow, belly breathing. She was PERFECT, just like she used to be. Thank you for teaching LIFE SKILLS!! 💕",UgxcoJwW8tIzRL5cVNR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-26T20:14:32Z,0.9972020387649536

669.0,"Dear Adriene, 
Today I did not follow along with your practice. I have you to thank for that. I woke up feeling really motivated to breathe, draw inward and move my body in ways that felt good... just like you've always taught me. So I rolled out my mat, played ""Porcelain"" by Moby quietly on repeat (this song is Yogi gold) and moved through a completely original practice that I created myself in the moment by flowing into each posture that both challenged me and felt good. All with everything that you've taught me all these years. What I learned today, was that doing this allowed me to connect my body and mind in a way that I've never been able to do while following any of your videos. Thank you for giving me the tools to do this on my own today. I love you, namaste.",Ugz4BEd34OTZqppZ5o94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-26T16:47:50Z,0.9997997879981995

I didn't have to argue with myself or force myself to do it. I just... wanted to.

It's really hard to explain how surreal it feels. I've been trying to get myself to do something like this for like 10 years and I always just gave up, but this time I didn't even think about giving up. I didn't want to.

That they aren't hour long extreme yoga workouts where you have to plan huge chunks of your life to fit them in and get disheartened when you are exhausted and wobbly and grumpy. They are so manageable. Bite size pieces of yummy which can be added in to other practices or done on their own for a quick check in.
