My neck and throat tend to get really sore, because my head is rather large (I feel a bit like a baby that can't hold up its own head) and heavy. Today, zero issue. My magic solution: don't work so hard. I am able to lift my shoulderblades of the ground now, but that's because I did it many many times without doing that. So I took a step back and just did the most intense movement that still felt comfortable. This is going to help me no longer dread day 6 and stick with it...

So I decided to repeat day 6 today. What seemed impossible yesterday, I could do today, recognising that some days are more difficult than others and the secret to success is not giving up, but trying again. Some days are better than others,  on the yoga mat and off. We just need to give ourselves a second chance, or even a third, or fourth, if necessary. I discovered you during the lockdown period here in South Africa and you helped me to stay sane, in more ways than one. I hope you know how many people from all over the world you are helping with your yoga channel, not just with your yoga lessons, but also your words. You are providing much needed therapy.

As I'm following along, I keep finding that as I'm not looking at the video the things that you're saying don't really describe what you're doing, so I found myself either in the wrong position / constantly pausing to look at the video. I couldn't focus and lost my flow a bunch of times, which hasn't happened so far.

Nothing feels good about all these crunches. They don't work out my abs as much as they make my neck hurt. We can do so many fun and graceful poses that are a dance to work out the core. Vinyasa, eagle, chair, warrior three, half moon, etc. Why crunches??? So far, all the videos in this 31 days of yoga are slow, sticky, boring, not flowing at all. I LOVE your attitude, but I feel your sequencing could use work. The weight loss strengthening video (next to the fountain) is awesome. Your No fear yoga is great too. Beautiful sequencing.

I was out of shape before health issues started a couple years and then it just got worse. I am Trying yoga as I thought it might help with these little age aches and around the same time got in a biggest loser competition at work as I also think losing weight would make me feel better so.. sorry for the mighty monologue I did a couple days of beginners with Adrienne and then started the revolution. I have repeated the days I couldn't do all the poses and so I did day 6 again yesterday. I finished best I could but still couldn't finish all the poses. Should I keep repeating the days I can't do or maybe jump back to beginners and start over after building some strength?  I hate to quit the revolution but at this rate I might be the first 6 month finisher of the 31 days! 😏,UgzRsBwxq9fKL4W-96J4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-03-26T13:45:30Z,-0.9979647397994995

433.0,"Hi Adriene, I'm loving your Yoga revolution. I find i get more out of it in the mornings if I warm up to it by doing some cross trainer for 10-15 mins and then a few squats and some gentle stretching. Otherwise I find I am very stiff and unable to even go into a front lunge and step back into down dog. It's very cold here in the UK so the warming up helps me stay warm throughout the 30 mins without socks on... I have a question about day 6: When you squeeze the imaginary block where is that block placed? Between the knees, inner thighs or the feet? It's hard to see whether your legs/knees/feet should stay connected when held in the air in that exercise or if there is space between them.

I noticed during the last exercise here where we crossed legs to the side and breathed, when I got into this position on both sides left and right I let out a huge yawns.
That's right big yawns that I've never had before… lol Sounds funny right? well yeah it was like Lion yawns and utter deep relaxation.

... then there was that side balance move, which, even after pausing, and really giving a try, my body screamed at the sheer injustice of my request. My body gave me all the nopes.

Maybe with the breaks but I will do it. Aaaand I finished without breaks! Yaaay! 🙂
So guys, thanks for motivation, it really helps to know that someone is dealing with the same problems🙂.
