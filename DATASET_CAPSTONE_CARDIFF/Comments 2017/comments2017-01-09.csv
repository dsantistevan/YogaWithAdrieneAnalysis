42.0,"So I think I discovered a secret about crow pose.

I thought I was supposed to shove my knees as far into my armpits as possible. And because I'm rather flexible in some parts of my body, I was really hiking them up way too far!

The back of my arms used to hurt a lot and I couldn't find a stable posture because my knees kept slipping over the muscles in my upper arms, to either side.

Now if I put my knees a whole lot lower, around about 1/3 of my upper arms, I'm able to find some amount of more flat space where my muscles are not in the way and all of a sudden the phrase 'a shelf for your knees' makes sense! So I think it's about finding that place in your body.

Maybe this could help some of you who think they can't do crow :)",UgxLj11-er2pf77HB1N4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-03-09T05:52:13Z,-0.9976052045822144

I loved it because I could feel how strong I was becoming through the video. And also these empowering poses makes me think only about how my muscles are working, if I'm feeling connected to each part of my body, and I don't think of anything else !

578.0,"‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è  I really liked when you said how we're trying to connect the heart, or even the spirit, to the body. In Chinese medicine the heart and spirit are almost synonymous. The Heart spirit is called the Shen, and it is the spirit that is our consciousness and personality. People who meditate- like you!- have really good Shen that you can see in the eyes. You have great Shen. And we've met in person, so I'm not just judging by videos, although they are equally as valid in reading that in someone!
