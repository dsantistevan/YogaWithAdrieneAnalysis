37.0,"Starting a comment diary to keep myself motivated. I want to be stronger, more connected to the ground and feel happier in myself!
Day 1 - Stiffer than I thought I'd be, but feel so happy having done it!
Day 2 - Still a bit shaky but I feel very stretched and nice
Day 3 - Felt good today, now I'm going to go on a run after!
Day 4 - I liked using the blanket in this session, it felt like I was a child again
Day 5 - I nearly forgot today, definitely hard to motivate myself but it was a really nice practice
Day 6 - Ahhhhh 6 pack abssss, I cannot do a side plank for the life of me
Day 7 - Felt unmotivated today and a bit down, but I feel better for centring myself and finding stability
Day 8 - Wow, some of these positions were actually really hard to get in to but it was great to stretch out
Day 9 - I honestly feel more core getting so much stronger. Also it makes such a difference to pull in your navel
Day 10 - Squeezing this in my lunch break was hard to get focused, but still managed a bit of peacefulness
Day 11 - I'm really feeling so much stronger and my body feels toned!
Day 12 - After the bank holiday and taking a 4 day break, this was hard :(
Day 13 - Lizard, pigeon and wild thing in one practice, my favourites - such a good stretch today
Day 14 - My body was so stiff today! I wonder why...",UgzOaEGlMgHtpnV0clx4AaABAg,3.0,2.0,2020-09-04T16:31:41Z,0.8879860639572144

153.0,"Hi Adriene,
I want to say thank you for this series. In the past month and a half I've been trying to manage a lot of change, stress, and chaos in my life, and your videos are so much a part of the positive energy that's come out of it. It's not easy every day, and your encouragement, patience, understanding and thoughtfulness in each video helps me to accept myself where I am.
I can feel my energy shift every day when I spend time practicing on the mat, I find myself looking forward to it almost as soon as I've finished. Even when it's hard to bring myself there to do it, or to stay, I can feel my muscle of self discipline getting stronger as I center myself and focus on the here and now.
Shortly before starting this series, I started DBT as well. The goals in DBT are to increase mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation and distress tolerance. Practicing with you every day has been such a reinforcement to what I learn each week. I wouldn't be where I am now without this practice. I am only at the beginning of a long journey to change my life, and I will strive to make it to the mat each and every day.

Thank you, for all of your hard work, your compassion, your energy.

197.0,"I finished Yoga Revolution this afternoon and just wanted to comment in case anyone is on the fence about giving it a shot. The change that I have seen is amazing. Yes, there is a noticeable difference in strength and flexibility from day one. But when I committed myself to 31 days, I was actually looking for more. This was part of Operation Clear Mind for me. I'd been sober for about 11 months and I wanted to find something that would help me stay focused and grow as I approached that one year anniversary. It worked.

Your approach to this is so, so valuable to anyone lucky enough to find these videos. I'm completely new to yoga, but it's not something I found when checking out other channels. The reminders to honor ourselves, to stay focused on and appreciative of where we are today, to realize that we're exactly where we need to be at this moment... those were things I already knew, but the daily reinforcement has really helped me continue to become more calm, content, and - dare I say - serene. I FEEL different on the days I do the practice in the morning. It lifts my attitude and slows my mind for the day. Plus I'm amazed that i actually managed to do something 31 days in a row:)

Thank you so much for this. I just created a playlist for myself with enough videos to fill every day of the next month and I look forward to continuing from there. You've got me hooked.",UgikCVU-16kWIHgCoAEC,1.0,78.0,2017-06-08T00:52:27Z,0.998749852180481

209.0,"I just finished the 31 days of the Yoga Revolution.  WOW!  So many times during this 31 day journey I thought I was not doing enough in my practice .. that I needed to add to what we did together to be more cut physically, be stronger, thinner, overall better.  Guess what happened?  As I chose acceptance and to ""be"" flowing with the practice at hand, I saw I was more than enough each and every day.. I am strong, cut and resilient already.                                                                                                         Additionally, I am a woman that has a strong faith in Jesus and many like minded people have rejected Yoga as an activity because of the association with Hinduism and Buddhism.

282.0,"THANK YOU SO MUCH, Adriene!! I have always wanted to get into yoga, but have always had a difficult time doing so. I am more interested in the spiritual aspects of it, and it seems so many are concerned with using it for exercise. I truly appreciate how often you remind us to breathe and pay attention to our bodies! And I can't tell you how much I appreciate your sense of humor! THAT makes me want to ""come back""!! Thanks to you, I now look forward to my daily yoga time!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!! 

For those of you in the community and on this thread, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ALL OF THE REVOLUTION VIDEOS!!!  Just go to 
https://gumroad.com/l/yoga-revolution

This is also a way we can give back to Adriene (No I am not advertising, I don't even know her personally). I just found this today! It asks for a donation of.. ready for this? $1.00!  Seriously! Again, THANK YOU Adriene!! 

SO if you have the ability to give more, It would be SO awesome if we try and give as much back to her, in appreciation, as she has given to us!! (again, I emphasize, I'm not affiliated with Adriene at ALL! I just believe in giving back to those who give so much for FREE! Contrary to what many people believe, the income she gets is most likely not even close to what she spends in time and money to make the videos. I looked it up and found this article. It's from 2014, but I'm sure the numbers are still close to being the same.
http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-youtube-stars-actually-make-2014-2

SO LET's SHOW HER HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE HER!!! By giving more than a dollar! Even if we all give a mere 5 bucks (and yes, that's a struggle for me as well at this time) I'm sure we can give her as much as she has given, in time, for us. Maybe. Let's try! :)

And I just HAVE to say again, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU Adriene!!!!! Namaste!!

Yoga is one of the only things that have helped me cope, 30 days of yoga made me feel so good about myself. But lately I haven't had the confidence to get on my yoga mat...
