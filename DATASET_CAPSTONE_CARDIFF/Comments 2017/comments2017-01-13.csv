20.0,"Today I became extremely sad without any particular reason and I started to dwell on my last relationship which finished bad and from which I moved months ago. I couldn't understand what happened and why I was having this pain out of the blue but I couldn't control it and was just randomly starting crying. Then I went on the mat and started crying again during the open hips pose feeling unlovable, miserable, and soaking in my pain. But by the middle of the practice, I became so concentrated on my poses and how it felt that I just forgot all this fuss about being sad before. 
Yoga (and Adriene) helped me to go through rough times months ago and now I realize that it became my coping mechanism to deal with inner pain. I still don't know why today I had this sudden attack of pain from the past when I'm really in a better place now but at least I know what to do if it's gonna happen again: hop on the mat!",Ugy9Eoa_eRWUbZNs0L14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-05-14T22:32:08Z,-0.9948539137840271

40.0,"Day 13! I just wanted to thank you adriene for your work! I subscribed to this channel a couple of year ago, but only now during covid pandemic I made a commitment with myself and I'm proudly on my 4th 30 days yoga journey! I feel so much better inside and out, I have a lot more strength, energy, patience (that one is hard for me sometimes), tolerance to frustration now! I had ZERO strength in my arms and abs and now only almost 5 months later I can stay in plank for an entire minute and get up using only my core! This journey made a enormous change in how I see and feel my body, and brought so much mindfulness! Even when I'm tired and roll my eyes when we go for another downward facing dog I feel that this is good for me :)
 So yeah, doing yoga with you made a huge impact on my life, really. There are many yoga teachers on youtube that focus on toning the body, losing weight, get the pose done, but you really teaches us what is most important: the body is a metaphor for whats happening inside.
I am healing, I am changing and your channel is a part of it! Thank you so much",UgyFXJ8V4C1l8Gj1uhR4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-11-27T15:46:07Z,0.9969934225082397

She's always saying things like ""take a moment"" ""find stillness""  be quiet"" yet i cant  take the moment to be quiet or still because she talks the whole way through the moment. Its quite frustrating because i get what her aim is however i feel like she unintentionally trying to force this awakening or surrender without a real opportunity to actually ""be quiet"". Maybe its a good idea to prewatch the vids to know when to tune her out so im not waiting for her next instruction.

192.0,"Between finishing day 12 and starting day 13, I spent a good part of my time looking through other youtube channels for more home exercise and I have to say, I can not find anything or anyone who has such a calming effect on me while looking for ways of improving my health and wellbeing.  I am absolutely loving the revolution that Andriene has put together and I am glad I was recommended her through my Doctor.

I loved today's session, especially the fact that we started on our backs and finished on our backs.  I find when I am on my back, I don't want to move, I have found my centre, but of course you can not just lay on the mat and do nothing but breath for 30 minutes right?  I was doing absolutely everything, until Andriene threw a curve ball my way.  I was lost as to what to do from pigeon pose because I didn't have the flexibility but I didn't give up, and switched off, I stayed tuned in and did as much as I could.

I couldn't believe by the end of it, I was huffing and puffing and like always felt in a better place compared to when I started.  

I have definitely made a commitment to this journey and I am glad I have pulled myself through each day as I feel as though it is part of my normal day.  I am really looking forward to the next revolution challenge, although I wonder if I will be still saying that when it comes to day 31.  

I am still struggling through my day, but doing 30 minutes of yoga has put me in a different frame of mind and I do feel good for doing it.  I never thought I would be talking about yoga, but I am definitely a convert.",UgwKZ8u3Q2pO0drVRPR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-12-05T10:36:53Z,0.9990097284317017

It just happened to be day 1 i had no idea. So i decided to give up my weight lifting regime for the month top dedicate myself to this revolutionary challenge. 
Anyway, point being today is my day off, and I was really feeling lazy and uninspired to do the practice today. I went in with the mindset of ""let's get this over with"".

I am not a very religious person, but my mom is in the hospital.  She had surgery last Thursday, and she is anxious to come home.  In order for that to happen, she needed some tubes to come out of her chest this morning.  As I rested in pigeon, I prayed for my mom and me to be patient with the nurses and doctors today and to be open to the results of the x-rays. I called her right after the yoga session, and she said ""Well, they just took the tubes out.  We practiced taking long deep breaths, and then they pulled it out on a big exhale.""  It was as if we were doing our deep breaths at the same time, and I was praying for her when the nurses were pulling out the tubes.  One more x-ray to make sure all is clear, and fingers crossed she's coming home today.  Such a cool experience.",Ugg-NF5R4yPBangCoAEC,6.0,341.0,2017-01-13T13:55:22Z,0.9122231602668762
