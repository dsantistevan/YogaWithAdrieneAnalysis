Really been focusing on whats true as of late for myself (and world somewhat, lots who knows what is really true & lots of blantant lies).. so focus on me and what is the truth for/about me. That will ripple out as I learn what is true and how to listen & speak my truth. Feel my throat chakra is clogged right now as do not feel allowed to speak my truth. Thank you for today. Love the chant as it really helps to find flow in throat chakra and in speaking truth.",UgwNGeJ8eXpZEbTy4fh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-11-05T10:45:40Z,0.9976119995117188

Ive tried to find my own ways to work thru those things, and some days Im more successful than others, but most days I just end up feeling like I dont belong.  I had set a goal for myself to do 365 yoga practices, and I dont want to give it up because I love the physical challenges, but I cant keep leaving the mat feeling emotionally worse than when I started which seems to be the case most days lately.

158.0,"WOW!!! WE are on day 29 and I was really looking forward to the day's practice as I never have a sneak peek as to what the next day will be.

I couldn't believe it was only 15 minutes, as I felt I could go on for longer, especially since I made the choice to be up early and have my day 29 practice done before walking out the door at 9:30.  

I am really enjoying this revolution and it has got me thinking about looking further into meditation.  I realise while following this series of videos, I really need to time to just look within and focus on myself instead of pushing myself through so I hope once day 31 is up, I can look to meditation and also continue with these yoga videos, although I don't know what one to turn on next.  It has been a great motivational tool for me as I haven't been so focused on making my day fulfilling in such a long time ... It is good to finally get a routine going again and I am just focused on making it all continue on during the next week.

I am working it out in my head when to have time for yoga, for meditation and for exercise inbetween family commitments ... but if I got this far, I can get through one week ... 

Thank you Adriene for these videos as I am definitely a convert to yoga and you have made me realise that I need to be even more kinder to myself and I should be listening more to my body than comparing myself to other people who have been through a cancer journey too because we all heal differently and for some they recover quickly while others take a while - and this is the path that I am finding myself on ... So thank you for making me realise this truth ...

316.0,"Wow that was really insightful! I re-discovered what my friends have been telling me, probably on a deeper level this time. I'm very hard on myself even with things that improve my life like my discipline for writing early in the morning, my exercise training, my work ethic etc...I'm not going crazy with negative thoughts, but I don't give myself time to praise, enjoy and feel good about it all. And I realized that I don't have to be hard on myself to grow and improve in anything. Like...I literally just discovered that. lol. I've probably preached that to friends of mine in the past too lol. So my revolution this year is to use love for myself to do the same things and grow in the same areas of my life that I have grown in, previously using 'hard' talk, like 'you can do better,' or 'good, but you're not there yet.' Instead, it will be stuff like, 'you're doing great and more, amazing growth is on its way,' and 'intense workout, now love your body and thank it with great nutrition so it stays and becomes stronger.' So a big thank you!

I appreciate how you combine warmth, wit, goofiness and wisdom, challenging and supporting your global group of yoga revolutionaries. When I saw that Day 20 (Inauguration Day) focused on practicing peace, I thought, ""Excellent! Now I hope that tomorrow is about strength and courage."" And it was!  This series has been the perfect start to 2017, making me feel calmer, stronger and more hopeful. Truth!",Ugj_Y4Xa0gs_j3gCoAEC,1.0,0.0,2017-01-29T15:24:24Z,0.9998694658279419

My first truth was my love for my 3yr old son - he then came in, dressed as a knight and did the session with me (well, sat on my lap for seated bits and did his downward dog underneath me as I did mine!)  It felt really beautiful.  I also used my final 'say it out loud' breath out so take the plunge and say 'I WILL write my book!' Funny (but great) saying it out loud!
