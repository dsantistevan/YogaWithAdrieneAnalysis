16.0,"I am confused by the balance I did have 3 months ago -with just some of the basics of just lifting one foot!-  I am now unable to do. I believe my mind has scrambled. I have just in this very moment realized this. My mind has scrambled. My body is confused too. 
Now I decide. I decide that this is okay. That the scrambling is part of my process, my own un-doing, releasing me from something no longer useful. Emptying so I can start with something less contrived from what I already  think is right or wrong or this or that. And as my mind and body figure this out, I am deciding to let this confusion and worry go. It is, in and of itself, un-useful.

125.0,"Day 18 and when this came up, I knew I wouldn't have any problems practice balancing because I seem to have good balance and today, I pushed myself into doing downward dog (again) and I found that today, I really pushed myself through.  

It was nice to hear Adriene say ""be sweet"" because when she said that, I was pushing myself through my own boundaries and it made me realise I needed to be kind to myself while doing the day's session.

I am so glad that I have been on this path for the past 18 days as I have really noticed changes in what I could do at the start and what I can do now.  I am developing strength in my arms, definitely in my legs and also in my core.  I have also gotten to the stage where I am saying that I am loving planking because I struggled through it when I was doing it in aerobic classes as part of warm downs.  I am holding my planks for 5 seconds and so I fall a bit behind but I end catching up.

I also had fun in today's session where usually, I am more focused and more serious about the movements and also listening and tuning in visually to see if I am doing things right.  I would love to feel my way around the mat but I am confident to step outside of the boundaries and get lost in the moment.  I am trying to stay on track and stay in the comfort zone.  Because of this, I haven't taken it upon myself to practice outside of the tutorials but I am sure over some time, I will be doing it as part of my exercise regime.

Thank you Adriene for changing my life and my body!  I am far from perfect, but feeling SO much better than I was (aches and pains-so bad I was tested for RA-which was negative).  

I have a question though...I never am able to go from 3 legged dog into a lunge.  Do you think it's a matter of time, or are some bodies just unable to?  I'm trying to be patient...but am so glad to be in the privacy of my own home when looking like an uncoordinated oaf!  ;)",UgxUgOWnWGuUNNwyGj54AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2017-08-18T02:06:31Z,0.8448746204376221

251.0,"Message To Beginners:
(and non-beginners, too, because, heck, I'm not exclusionary.)
If you have been on this 31 Days of Yoga Journey with Adriene, me, and 2 million other viewers, just know that wherever you're at, keep with it! These practices have been challenging. And, if you find yourself being super wobbly, or you're looking at screen to make sure you're doing it right, or you can't step your foot up to the front of the mat from plank or down dog, FINE! Wobble, Look, Check, Grab your leg inch it into place. Just keep at it. I'm 265 lbs, and I can't do half of this stuff. Luckily, I've been practicing yoga on and off for over 10 years. I'm lucky enough to know quickly modifications I need to make. And, I have lots of props to help me. Blocks, Infinity Strap, Bolsters, a Yoga Wheel, and straps. So, I can make it work. If you are really new to yoga and can follow along, WOW, give yourself a huge high five because you are Strong! But, if you are new and are feeling discouraged, just know that even ""beginner yoga"" can be very hard for people. For various reasons. But, keep with it. You WILL feel different after a month.  I think it's awesome we're all here doing this (no matter what level we started at), and I'm blessed to be a part of this. Love you all.

343.0,"Dear Adriene. Thank you so much for your positive mind and this amazing challenge! I started last week on a Wednesday and I was so committed and enthusiastic that I turned it up a notch. The first four days I did 4 practices a day, YES INSANITY! On Saturday I only had to do day 13 and 14 and from Sunday on I could start with the daily uploads.

Because of worn knee cartilage, a birth defect at my left SI joint and suffering from brain damage I'm having major issues with balance, getting my thoughts sorted, being in the moment, enjoying life and being in control of my emotions. For my knees and back I tried physiotherapy but that didn't work. For my mind I tried mindfulness, but I can't concentrate enough to keep that up. Yet now I committed to this 31 days I'm noticing a huge difference and it makes me feel good and proud of myself.

Today I was able to stand in tree pose with ease. During plank pose I'm noticing it is getting easier and my body strength is increasing. I even surprise myself when you come up with new challenges to certain poses and I can do it just like that. Last week I often found myself saying ""Oh hell no Adriene! Not happening!"" and now I more like ""Bring it on and lets do it!"". That just happened in one week of hard practice. The only day that was hard on me was day 12, because I literally broke down in tears. So much emotions took over that day, I just surrendered and kept on practicing while crying. I felt better afterwards though!

After these 18 days I feel more in control, aware, mindful, I learned to be better at putting things in perspective and be at peace with what I can and what I cannot do. These changes mean so much to me because it's good to know that although my body isn't a strong as it should be and my brain is messed up, I can feel lots of happiness in where I'm at at this moment and witness stillness and be in control of myself. I needed this so much!

I love your positive vibe and spirit! Much love to you Adriene! Looking forward to tomorrows challenge! I Namaste! <3

365.0,"Totally just connected to the whole practice on a brand new level and almost started to cry. Did you guys hear Adriene's heart beating at the beginning of cooldown laying down on her belly( approx 21min in)?? Just felt so soothing hear her loving heart beat.. like some secret message. I know I'm being so emotional right  now since loosing my dog yesterday.. he was almost 14 years and it was time, but still the sadness of his passing feels overwhelming. So thankful for being part of yoga revolution, helps me with my emotions right now. Yesterday stared crying in savasana.. felt so healing. Thank you Adriene for being here and giving me tools to heal from this pain. üíñ",UgiXENAxPTPIcHgCoAEC,0.0,7.0,2017-01-18T13:01:16Z,0.998384952545166
