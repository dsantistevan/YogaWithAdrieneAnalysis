 And started me off right, but I need more work his area r sure. I’m pinning this practice too, so I can come back to it.

162.0,"Hi Adriene. I stopped at day 19 on the morning of April 3. I came back today. It was a hard practice for me, not because the practice was hard but because, when I came home from work on April 3, I found my 54 year old husband had passed away from a heart attack. The last thing he saw me doing was my day 19 of Revolution. He told me how proud he was of me and what I had accomplished with my yoga practice. I then got ready for work and hugged and kissed him goodbye for the last time. So this ""peace"" practice was a very fitting first practice back. I could not repeat the mantra ""everything is as it should be"" because it is not. My husband is supposed to be here to grow old with me. But thank you for this practice I needed it more than ever. <3",Ugx4mbZHkj9kVPtxLEt4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2018-04-23T02:10:44Z,0.9979538917541504

176.0,"I came to the mat in a really good frame of mind because I have taken it upon myself to get everything that is on my mind out of the way before making the commitment of 30 minutes of yoga.

It worked wonders for today, because I was more focused on what was happening on the mat and I concentrated on every breathe through out with not a thought in place. I even took it upon myself to move around the mat instead of sitting but I was still focused and tuned into my breathe and Adriene's voice. There are some voices that you want to switch off to, but with Adriene's, I find myself very settled and tuned in.

Today, I have to say, I felt stronger in my shoulders and in my core, especially when we were working the legs. At times, you do feel like giving up because a wrist hurts because of the weight, but today, I worked through the pain and I was really proud of myself to have accomplish the work out. Okay, with my flexibility being a no show, I did keep the legs moving when it was time to get the leg to the shoulder, but apart from that one little hiccup, once again, I was in a good place when the 30 minutes was over. I am able to do downward dog for a longer period of time and like I said, I did well with the leg and hand coordination and balancing.

I am really looking forward to tomorrow's lesson and see what limits I can push in the 30 minutes.

Thank you Adriene for making these uploads available as I am enjoying myself and benefiting from these 30 minutes.",Ugxe6B7AzBY0yq6QQSl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-12-12T02:52:00Z,0.9982396364212036

Spine alignment, focus on movements, body awareness... suddenly I was practicing something *very close* to yoga in the pool. 
Cut ahead a few months, I decided to rekindle my Yoga With Adriene relationship. I promised myself that I would watch my limits and be very careful with my hamstring. I'm still paying as much attention to my limits as the poses. But today is a celebration! 
I noticed today that my legs can extend more than before, and I type this without a single bit of pain! My hamstrings aren't better yet, but they're on the road (I hope).

242.0,"Day 20 Check

So....Something weird happened to me while doing this.


Well, it's actually very embarrassing, so feel free to point and laugh. While I was doing these forms, I started getting angry and frustrated because I couldn't do them correctly. I also began thinking about my everyday worries and loneliness and other problems in life. I was angry beucase I couldn't do anything to relieve my and I resorted to Yoga. And I was more angry when I started thinking that this was not helping, Yoga was not helping. I couldn't find peace, I couldn't relax, I couldn't find any form of respite. I just only felt the exact opposite. I was just enrage, frustrated, and just couldn't focus. 

Then in the middle of one of the exercises... I just started to cry. I just cried. I don't know why I did, I just did. I just carried on with this exercises and cried while doing it. I guess, my forms got better, I don't know. I was focused on them. I just cried the whole way through while doing this. After a this exercise, I didn't know what to make of it. I still don't know what to make of it.

I'm 25 year old male, who has pretty much killed his dignity by telling this whole experience, so feel free to point and laugh. I just don't know anymore. So I'd like to ask for some insight, if it's alright. To be honest, it's frustrating to think about it. I really don't know why I cried and I'm mad at myself and disappointed. 

So...yeah. Feel free to point and laugh and if you could offer some explanation why this happened, that'd be great.",Ugz9l3_u5-zDk3hURTN4AaABAg,4.0,0.0,2017-03-28T07:23:15Z,-0.9973729848861694

348.0,"Hello Adriene and fellow yoga friends! I am brand new to the practice and I have absolutely loved the 31 days of yoga thus far. I am excited to make yoga a part of my routine every day even after the 31 days are over! However, I am a little undecided where I should go from here since I am a beginner. This is a question for Adriene as well as any other fellow yoga friends: what videos of Adriene's do you suggest for every day yoga? Another 30ish day challenge? A particular day, night routine for every day? Some things I LOVE about the 31 days of yoga is hearing something new every day from her (you) as well as a different routine to change it up on a day to day basis. 30+ mins preferred because these go by so fast for me! And since I am brand new I am still working on my connection between my movement and breath so I don't want anything too fast paced. I believe only 1 or 2 days out of these videos so far have been a little too fast for me at points. I hope to get some suggestions and any advice to someone new to yoga!
