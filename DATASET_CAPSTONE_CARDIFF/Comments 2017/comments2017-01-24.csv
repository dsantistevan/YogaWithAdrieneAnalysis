1.0,Surely one has to take into account one’s weight in evaluating whether or not you can realistically expect to do some of these poses.

40.0,"This is such a good one! I was intimidated by the length of it at first, but so glad I did it. I'm doing the Breath series now, day 8! But wanted to finish up Revolution along side it, as I had not quite finished before Breath started. Thank you for honoring all walks of life, especially for Elephant pose. I have moderate scoliosis, but have always had a very strong back and things, and especially good flexibility thanks to yoga. 

I've always struggled with core strength and strength in my glutes as well as hip flexibility. Even when I was very active, going to the gym and practicing yoga every day.

Since the p^andemic started, I was laid off from my very active job (I was a nanny and also walked to and from work). I've also become more depressed and just lacked motivation. I got back into yoga finally last month. This is the first time ever in my life (I'm 30) that I've been able to activate my core and my pelvic floor. In addition to the scoliosis (which has gotten worse since the pandemic) I have a very weak pelvic floor from a traumatic childbirth experience. My pain and tightness have made me slow down and be PATIENT. I'm using muscles I never have before. I realize now that I CAN engage my side abs while breathing deeply into my belly.

Its like I've peeled back a new layer. Thank you.",UgypP6ePUKv3YNsHa4d4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2021-01-09T01:45:32Z,-0.8007949590682983

I couldn't even begin to do that last pose.  I still can't do the crow pose or even come close and being so busty and my big boobs in the way, it is really frustrating.  I guess that was the practice, to just be patient with yourself, but it was frustrating and I thought I would be able to do more, at this point.  But, I did what I could do and it was fine. I lost my patience with my ex boyfriend tonight and perhaps him with me and took my Chaweenie on a play date at the new home I am staying.  So much is changing now and I am so drained, but do feel much better after this practice.

131.0,"Patience has never been one of my virtues and today was no exception. I do believe you hit just about every single one of my least favorite, least doable poses in this practice.   It was a real struggle to not feel like a complete failure today.  Bus stop 4??? I think the bus was trying to blow by me at the first stop!  Lol  BUT, as much as I wanted to quit halfway thru, I did the best I could and completed the practice.  So maybe for me todays practice was more about perseverance than patience.  Thats okay, that works,  too. 😁   Practice #114 complete!",UgzIi6CzR33uQhLKho54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-01-09T23:24:59Z,0.8952031135559082

139.0,"So today it was funny that the theme was patience.  I was running behind this morning, so my mindset was already, let's hurry!!  I go to turn my tv on, and for some reason my youtube channel won't connect to the internet, so I had to go to my office and put ya on my computer, which proves to be a bit more difficult to watch you when I need to.  So, despite a rocky start, I persevered!   I must say, as a beginner I sure try and do the more advanced poses, but I know I look absolutely awkward!   I pretty much stayed at bus stop one, but did attempt to move into bus stop 2, and when I tried the 3rd or 4th variation(elephant?), I though OMG, how am I ever going to do that?!?!  I thought the same thing about the crow though too, and now I can hold that, even if it's only for a few seconds!

I find it so pleasurable for my body to just show me surprises, when I can do something all of a sudden, instead of working for something everyday, being disappointed if I don’t get it that day. Like today, I did crow pose for about 3 seconds and I’m so proud and happy with that! I also love downward dog and letting the blood rush towards my head, so I love each time we practice downward dog.

I remember how I started with yoga. Only the short YWA video's/practices once in a while. 

Then after a while I was like: I want more! So I switched to longer video's/ practices. Then I started Revolution (doing it for the 2nd time) and now I find myself on my mat everyday, if not twice a day and time flies!

I was saying to myself, that it must have been my rest day as I have been doing some form of exercise everyday.  

I am pushing myself to move through the revolution journey and I think because we are getting to the end of the path, my body is slowing down, and looking for rest so today, while on the mat, I took things at my pace, did what I could do, and joined in when I was able to do a move.

I realize that most probably it wasn't the result of the practice but of a little disappointment that I had last night and didn't really want to acknowledge, but I had never had these emotions rise up while on the mat... It was kind of scary at first, but then I thought to myself, this is what yoga does, it opens your body up so that your soul can open up as well...

440.0,"I have a question to Adriene and other yogis here. I've been practicing yoga (with Adriene:)) for 2 years now. My flexibility improved and my strength is visibly greater than it was. (I can hold a side plank ,I don't crash my chin against the floor in chaturanga as I did the first time I tried it and didn't expect it to be so hard because it looked so easy when Adriene did it! Haha.) But for my own satisfaction and to develop my practice I'd like to be able to do the splits and such awesome arm balances as the one at the end of this session. Yet I can't. I know I miss arm and core strength and general flexibility. The question is: is it possible to gain the missing things through everyday yoga practice or is it necessary to do some extra non-yoga exercise? Like simply stretching? I would really appreciate to hear your thoughts and experiences:)",UgjeaY_1lsN43HgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-24T16:01:37Z,0.9629611968994141
