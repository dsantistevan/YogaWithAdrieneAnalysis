292.0,I've been practicing yoga semi regularly for a few years now but haven't gone 30 days in a row since my first 30 day yoga challenge 4 years ago. I was absolutely surprised when I finally did crow today and have been crying tears of joy since then. I've wanted to land this pose for so long now and when I least expected it. it happened. Just like you've always said. I always thought I couldn't do it because I wasn't strong enough. My arms were too weak. While I know I've built up muscle there these past few weeks when I finally got into crow I realized i could have physically done this a while  ago. It was the mental pressure that was keeping me back.,UghwINd2KI5lFHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-02-02T03:21:45Z,-0.8910384774208069
