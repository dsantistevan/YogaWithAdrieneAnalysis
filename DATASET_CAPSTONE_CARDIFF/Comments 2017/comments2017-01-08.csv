0.0,"To be honest I cried it's been such a long time since I cried. Gosh I've been such a poop nugget to myself most of my life. Being on strict diets hating my body jerking my self around in life. Yoga Revolution is exactly what I needed to remind myself that some days I'm going to fall, I'm not always going to be on my A game and that's okay. It's just day 8 and I already fell like 6 times and each time it was amazing because each time I found the strength to try again instead of just getting angry at myself for not being able to hit a certain shape.

I found stretching my neck to the right affected my breathing. Very strange. I found it harder for some reason, but I stuck with it.

I know I am in the extreme minority when it comes to this, but the amount of coarse language used in this video was very distracting for me, especially when it's supposed to be a ""serene"" practice. I don't understand the need for using expletives during yoga. Yes, these are considered mild expletives, but every time I hear them it jolts me out of my relaxation. Out of all your videos that I've watched I've only heard a few words here and there, but this one video had quite a few.

I just wanted to say that I have wanted to try Yoga for nearly a decade, but I didn't have the money or time regularity to join a class to actually get into the practice. I also get self conscious in group work out classes. Someone told me to check out YouTube. So I bought a Yoga mat one day, and did some free Yoga research online and your page came up. I figured I would give it a try and started with this Revolution segment. I have always been very interested in Indian culture and history as well as the interesting ideas of energy reading and chakras. I am so happy that I chose your video segments to watch and learn how to do the practice of Yoga. You explain the meaning of the pose and how to connect it with your energy and I cannot appreciate that enough. 


I have tried the Tree pose before I ever really knew anything about Yoga, and this video really explained how to actually find that stability. I fell the first few times, and then I finally understood the push and pull combination. Thank you for opening my world up to this meditative and whole body experience of Yoga practice. I look forward to finish this Revolution quest and continuing on with your many other videos. Thank you so much!",Ugy0CzYowzoGbzalURV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-08-06T13:34:39Z,0.9951530694961548

I have been feeling restless and unsure with what to do with myself. The free time I have with the summer gives me free time for my mind to roam in dangerous places. Practicing yoga has been what helps me to remember just how beautiful and extraordinary life and myself are. I feel like myself when I do yoga, I feel that love and yumminess. I also remember just how much I don't let my mind take a break during the day.  I have been doing the yoga series almost everyday since January and I still struggle.

You're able to explain yoga in such a way that it feels so *right* while I'm doing it. Yoga before I found your channel felt great and helped me in so many ways, but it wasn't until I found you that it had true meaning for me. I do have a question, though. For as long as I can remember, whenever I'm doing any sort of exercise that involves laying on my back and lifting my head up (most recent example is minute 22 of this video), I experience tightness and pain in my neck, as well as an uncomfortable fullness in my head. Is this just a matter of needing more strength in my neck? Maybe I'm tensing up in places I shouldn't?

I was in a bad place when I came to the mat today because things hadn't gone as planned but by releasing all thoughts, and tuning into Adriene's voice, I was in another place and one of serenity.  A place with no care in the world.  As always, I took the time to relax and to give the movements meaning.  I took in my breathes slowly and released slowly with every movement.  I am still struggling through poses due to being inflexible but I am getting to a place where by the end of the 30 minutes I am feeling beyond relaxed and with no care in the world.

366.0,"Over the last years i've attended several classes, hoping to understand why yoga is important and why so many people attest to its power. I was largely disenchanted by the yoga community's polarities. On one extreme, fitness and beauty gurus pushing the perverse ideals of physical beauty and weight loss in western society, and on the other,   the strict spiritual doctrines and mysticism of various yogis. Adriene is the first yoga instructor i've encountered who strikes a perfect balance between the two extremes, grounding the spiritual in the physical and the physical in the spiritual in a forgiving and lighthearted way. Now, not only do I see that yoga is important, but FEEL that it is essential to my body.",UgipNaHkvYiQ2HgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-06-16T22:26:20Z,0.9987836480140686

I'm doing this 5 months after most others but wanted to let you know - absolutely loving it. Have incorporated your revolution into my yogi teaching journey as I undertake my first yoga teaching studies this year.
I have spent alot of time over the last 2 years on my mat with you in a small regional town from Australia. I really enjoy your classes and enjoy your sense of humour and fun. Learning 'how to' as a teaching student - its lovely to get constantly reminded when i do your class that there is 'no yogi robots'.

Also about reflexology, I'm a cosmetologist myself so I know a bot about it. You should look into lymph and how it follows through the body. There are lots of lymph nodes in the feet, hands, and in the throat. The ones in the throat actually swell in you get sick. This is because lymph nodes filter out toxins. If you massage them it helps bring down the swelling. Lymph follows wherever blood isn't, but blood and lymph are both part of the circulatory system. Different parts of the feet are connected to different parts of the body, for example, the heels of the feet are connected to sexual sensation.

404.0,"Thank you so much for this, Adriene! This is my first attempt (ever) at Yoga and I'm already noticing both mental changes and improved mobility. The Sockets in my shoulders do no longer snap when I do push-ups or perform similar movements. I'm so glad that I have discovered your channel and yoga at this time in my life. I'm fairly certain that a younger version of me instantly would have discarded Yoga due to pride. Perhaps the biggest achievement is that I now allowing myself to fail and still keep going, knowing that me falling short in the present doesn't mean that I will fall short in the future. I feel blessed that I through your work have found a way to improve flexibility and my the overall health, because for the longest time I have been embarrassed about my stiff joints and limited movement. And also.. Whenever I get confused, insecure or doubtful you somehow miraculously manage to address those exact matters only a couple of minutes later through encouragement, or simply by recognising the problems we beginners might have with the training. Those moments have been truly valuable to me. There are a lot of new sensations I have discovered by following your lessons. For example: This whole day have been really emotional to me. My thighs feel beat up and I've been on the verge of crying multiple times. It's been quite confusing to say the least. I know you mentioned that this could happen in the video, but could you give an explanation to why it does?  These lessons have so far also helped me be more present and loving towards myself. This Mindfulness I'm experience through your lessons is something I have experienced previously and also lost track of multiple times in my life. But I think that I finally have reached a level where I'm ready to start establishing routines that will help me stay on this right track and not fall back into my old self-destructive ways of thinking. I rambling now. However, the real reason for me writing is that I wonder how you suggest us to continue when these 31 days are over? I prefer to do the yoga in the morning when I wake up and quite frankly I prefer watching somebody instruct me what to do than making up my own exercises.

As a professional musician, your attention to detail is just what I need and your silliness is the perfect antidote to my sometimes too serious approach to just about everything.

426.0,"Adrien, I just wanted to say that I've been suffering (I wouldn't say it was incredibly painful but it was inconveniencing) from a very sore spot on my back for the last few weeks.  I thought it was sciatica but the stretches I would try would work.  So I pushed through a lot of my workouts.  Then I got to day eight and in the middle of the first of the leg twists, I felt a small pop in my back and the pain started easing.  It's by no means gone and I'm going back to my chiropractor but it is definitely a first step to finding out what was wrong.  Thank you very much for your yoga series.  I've been practicing with you for about two years and it has helped me exponentially.

427.0,"Day 8 Check.

Ok I'll admit, this one was kind of nice and relaxing. I just only wished that my forms could be perfect as well as my balance. I really push myself in yoga, even if it means taking the most difficult forms and I get mad at myself for not getting forms that are good as Adriene. I know that I shouldn't compare to others, but I honestly don't care. I barely have time for yoga and it actually becomes more difficult for me to find time to actually commit to these videos. That's why i push myself so hard to actually being perfect. I don't care if it's realistic. Not one excellent prize was ever earned by traveling an easy road. If I must go through pain to get to my goal, then so be it. If it means pushing myself to get those perfect forms, fine. I just only wish that Yoga was meant for me. I'd be happy if it was just easy for me AND relaxing (which I honestly don't think it is), like this training session.

Thanks anyways, Adriene. I only wish that I could be just as good as you and many other individuals or better. But I'm not.",UggNb99klZqPLXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-03-10T11:12:35Z,-0.956031084060669

I started doing your 30 days of yoga and 3 weeks in I was back at work. I finished that 30 day challenge and am now on day 8 of revolution. I was never able or had the right mind set to do yoga before I found you. I absolutely love the way tou teach / explain everything... and your quirky personality is a plus! I see myself ;) Thank you so much for introducing me to this wonderful time I finally take for myself. I feel great and even when Im tired and have just put my kids to bed at 8pm after work I still want to get my yoga on before a little TV instead of grabbing a glass of wine and vedging out.

Thank you for helping me a little every day. I used to do yoga in high school just in my bedroom. I was always relaxed and my daily movements were with intention and care.

Thank you for reminding to add this as a bookmark… 
I noticed that the behind area of my ears down through the sides of my neck had a sensation of draining down from the eardrums. 

That felt very good and I actually think there was draining feeling into my throat. I also noticed that my facial expressions were really able to relax and that right there I called serenity. 
Referring back to the draining sensation in the back of my throat… I think that this Day 8 is very good for someone who is sick with the flu or has any type of congestion in  their throat and neck

503.0,"Looking at the comments and reflecting on my own strong reaction to this practice, it's amazing how spot-on you are, Adrienne. By the time we started rubbing our feet and you said, ""this can be a moment for some where it's emotional... sometimes when you rub your feet you feel like crying...sometimes things come up that are more emotional..."" I was SOBBING (laugh-sobbing when you actually said those words). It was funny and reassuring that you could predict my crying episode.

And, well, that had less to do with not rubbing my feet very often (I LOVE to rub my feet, and I have a heavenly little green ball that's made for massaging your hands and feet) and had way more to do with the 15 minutes that came before this. I've been struggling lately with negative self-talk, and the moment when you wanted us to experience self-love was really difficult for me. I was also really tight in my hamstrings and my hips, and that was frustrating. So by the time I got to the foot rub, I was ready to let it ALL out.",UghXzNVYz0QjTngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-26T23:43:13Z,-0.7967803478240967

The amazing results are i.e. a relaxed and straight spine, a very effective  and ongoing massage of your reflex zones and therefore your inner organs, healing feet and legs and hips, warm feet, a deeply felt connection to Mother Earth and ... serenity :) So there you go.

My niece has epilepsy and when she has a seizure my sister holds onto her feet and draws the energy down and out of her body through an acupressure point on the bottom of the foot (liver 3). Often this can stop the seizure in under a minute. Once I actually witnessed the energy pass from my niece's legs/feet into my sister's hands/arms as directly after my niece's legs stopped shuddering, my sister's arms immediately started to. It was spooky. My sister says the process is to ground my niece's energy through her feet.",Ugh58_NcIcra6ngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-13T13:46:21Z,0.9846056699752808

638.0,"Since Adrienne invited us to share reflexology tips, just wanted to add a few more about the feet. There are also great meridian points in between your toes (especially between big toe and second toe) and also massaging the outside of your big toe is good for pain release (as well as the fatty part of your palm where thumb meets the wrist). I'm not a reflexologist but my yoga teacher is also a massage therapist so she always passes on great tips about reflexology in class. Also, make sure to drink lots of water after massaging the points (to help with detox/energy release with chakras--water is always a good idea in general after yoga practices, especially after this one today since we were massaging reflex points).

After this practice I feel like I finally have to write something. I've been doing yoga with you for some time now. I've done 30days of yoga and other stuff. Though I'm just a teen, my life isn't in balance at all. School, friends and family issues make me cry a lot and I'm sad, confused and scared very often. Also my body isn't perfect. Ever since I can remember I'm overweight and it doesn't matter how much I try to change it, I can't. Thanks to you, lot of things in my life have changed. I don't hate myself as much as I used to, and now I know that everything important is in my head. This practice was one of the best I've done with you, and I'm so thankful for it. It is everything I need after a day with just few hours of sleep, and lot of stress in school. Well I really hope that I'll stick with this beautiful Yoga Revolution, because as many others I need a Revolution in my life in order to find balance, peace, happiness and beauty in myself and in the world.

Anyone who has been a lifeguard will know this. You put the arm that is on the ground straight out and rest your head on it. Both legs, or at least the top one, are bent for stability and balance, and your top arm is lightly resting on the ground. Taking this time in this pose helps me remember that I am getting up, but that I can take this love for myself into my day. It's just a nice step and stops myself from wrenching myself off the floor.

You tought me that it is a journey.. towards finding myself.. and I feel it every time as I can practixe yoga with you that you help me, you guide me through this jurney.

733.0,"It's day 8! Ain't that great? :) ... seriously though, Adriene, if you're keen to learn about feet, also consider learning about footwear and the relationship between foot shape and shoe shape (especially sneakers, where high impact activities take place in). Not necessarily the 'fit' of the shoe, as a shoe can be the right size, but still angle your joints (of which the feet have many!) in ways that are not noticeable in the short term, but can be harmful in the long term... You could do a ""Yoga for a night after high heels"" (haha) for treatment and maybe do a blog or send out emails about healthy shoe choices for prevention : )",UgjnB5X2azmOYHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-08T22:25:28Z,-0.9716348052024841
734.0,"Loved today's practice! I always get a big grin on the inside when I get to use a pillow! Yesterday's practice was just hilarious tho. My 3.5 yr old was eating his dinner while I was working my abs. He asked 'who is your friend mummy? I wish we could go to her house. Does she have toys?!' On discovering that Adrienne lives far far away he cried a little bit and had the genius idea that I could just tell Adrienne to get a spaceship and come to our world! 😆 Then he proceeded to criticise my practice 'no you're doing it wrong mummy' telling me 'I can see your bum!' every couple of minutes as my leggings kept riding down. All the while, I'm shaking with the effort of using my surprised stomach muscles and struggling to listen to the video whilst talking about spaceships or defending myself from his criticisms 😂 Ridiculous and hilarious. But still, I toned my abs and kind of loved his involvement. At least he wasn't trying to get underneath me to join in with my downward dog! That's what usually happens. Must remember to feed child while doing yoga. It keeps him off my mat! Love to all you beautiful people.

755.0,"After following the channel for a little over a year, I like to do about an hour of yoga a day. It started as a curiosity about what yoga is and an attempt to get leaner, but now I find it helps not just the physical body but my spiritual body as well, as cliche as that sounds. Now, I notice a difference in my overall mood if I don't do yoga that morning and with the Revolution practice, I like to start with one of Adrienes other videos that is around a half hour (today it was abs and arms) and finish with the daily Revolution video. Adriene has become one of my favorite people in my life, and we've never met. I read one of her instagram posts about fostering relationships with women recently when she was always one of the guys and it really resonated with me. She always makes me smile and never takes herself too seriously,  which are two of my very favorite qualities in a person!",Ugh0uSbXky2Ch3gCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2017-01-08T21:00:06Z,0.9974652528762817

757.0,"Dear Adriene, 

I believe you don't realise how much impact you can have on peoples' life. Good, positive, loving. I randomly discovered YWA 3 years ago and I can't believe I've been doing yoga for so long (for me it's a long time), when I knew nothing about it. This program really helps me as it brings everything together and I love not only the hard, body-toning workout, but I love the emotion you teach people all around the world to put into their practice. And it helps!Tremendously! My mantra is 'EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON',  so thank you for happening, as I know the reason now. More love, more peace and the opportunity to share all this with others!

 I hope your channel will never go, as it would be a sadder world. It's inspirational!

 Namaste.
