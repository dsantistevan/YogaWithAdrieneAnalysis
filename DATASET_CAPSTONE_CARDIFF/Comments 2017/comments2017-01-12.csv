Sometimes I feel emotion/energy  being stuck in my body, last 2 days in the form of a stiff lower back. I tried to get my head around it, but didn't find answers...

Today during the twist/stretch while sitting up. My back was so stiff, but that stretch made that energy in my lower back come loose. I understood what it was about... I started to cry while laying on my back.

All and none at once.” And I thought to myself, aww that’s pretty cool—this rickety leg is just a bit of a blockage that I need to send some stardust through.” And wouldn’t ya know it, I steadied out!!

I have trouble keeping up with you on the flows because my transitions,  especially in and out of lunge, suck and I always feel like Im chasing you and my breath gets out of whack. I need to learn its okay to do my own pace but hard to do 😐.  I also felt it was easier and more stable for me to put my leg back on an exhale instead of an inhale so i kept it in sync but opposite to you.   But I completed the practice, even did horsey lips, so goid on me.  Quick question, Im over 3 months in and Im still sore every day, especially my lower back.  Is this normal?  Everyone says they are feeling less pain with yoga and Ive actually had more than when I started (more soreness than pain but it is constant). I keep hoping the soreness will eventually work out.

175.0,"AT the start of the video Adriene said about being in the NOW, and prior to tuning in to day 12, I was thinking ahead to what I want to do next year when it comes to my health and wellbeing.  Whilee I was moving through today's class it occurred to me, not to start next year, but start today.  Instead of thinking to next year or even next week, if you have got plans to up your health and wellbeing, do it NOW not later, and so from today's class it wasn't just about my health and wellbeing but about pulling my life together NOW.  It is amazing what thoughts flow through your mind when you are focused on your breathing and yourself for 30 minutes and at the same time, tuned into one voice around you.

I really pushed to make today's session happen for me in the morning as I had a list of things I have to do for the day, and I made it a priority to put Adriene at the top of my list of what I need to do.  Knowing that I am more capable of doing yoga in the morning compared to the afternoon or evening, I have made the commitment to do the revolution in the morning or as early as possible if there is an appointment to be had.  I am committed to pushing myself through this routine of yoga in the morning and then walking in the day.  

I am still waking up feeling tired and by the mid afternoon I am starting to wind down but I am wanting to add extra exercise into my routine.  I will stay with the yoga until I am able to fully commit to another exercise.  Spiritually, I feel as though I am ready, but physically I have a long way to go.  It has only been 2 weeks since turning into Adriene and I am in a good place, as I am focused on what is important to me NOW and it is finding movement in my day through yoga and through walking and concentrate on what I can do NOW and not what I want to do.",Ugw2ozFyUixzimutOv14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-12-04T01:31:28Z,0.9782686829566956

218.0,"Thank you Adriene for inviting us to all of your practices. My friends and I started the "" 30 days of Yoga "" because we had done it in the pass and saw the benefits of it, but just couldn't find the right instructor, until now.  A quick back story of how we got here. We are all rock climbers and it was hard to progress each and every time we showed up to the gym, some of us had plateaued and didn't know how to get out of our funk. How can we become stronger, flexible, and tone?  It was a lot of fun!  It was kind of like a book club, we would usually talk about how we enjoyed some days and some days you kicked our butts.  We started noticing a change after the first day. Not only in our climbing lives, but our overall life style. How we move, breath, and speak all changed as we kept on knocking out the days.  

In the beginning my goal was to get more fit for rock climbing, but now my goal is to be a better human being not only to others but to myself as well. Words cannot express how grateful I am to you and this community for showing my friends and I how to not only get stronger physically but mentally as well. Thank you for showing us the vault of emotions and strength that was hidden inside all of us.",UggVyT_93sAEjXgCoAEC,2.0,73.0,2017-06-13T22:24:16Z,0.941213846206665

226.0,"I almost didn't finish this practice today. 

I had a really hard time, especially at the fiery first half of the video.I woke up feeling heavy, my spine is very stiff today for some reason, I became exhausted very quickly, I was panting the whole time. 
At about minute 14 I paused the video, sweating like a pig and hardly breathing, angry, disappointed with myself. I wanted to stop right there, I was so close to closing the browser. 

But then I though to myself- 
""There are off days. It's okay to sometimes have it hard. It's okay to not always just have fun and be able to connect to your inner self and be at peace with your body. Just push through, give a chance to yourself and finish the video""

So I continued the video. 
At some point you said something about a frustrated tree and it hit me so deep I actually teared up. 

I finished the video and I'm very disappointed with how my body was feeling most of the time, but I'm proud of myself for just finishing at all. 
I hope tomorrow I will feel better. :)

BUT. Today I managed to do Tree Pose on my right hand side with my foot to just below the knee and STAY THERE (I fell off after that, but that's okay.) It was a real achievement. I just never thought it would take so LONG. And it's hard imagining all the other people watching managing to do better, some without much effort.

I need to remember this is my journey. I don't know why my balance is so poor - I'm in my twenties, I go HORSE-RIDING (you need a LOT of balance for that), but that's how it is. It doesn't matter who is doing better. I am being me.
