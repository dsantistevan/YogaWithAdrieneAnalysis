My favorite lyrics were ""She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs, Swears like a sailor when she shaves her legs, She takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin', I'm never gonna let her go..."" Those lyrics came to mind when I thought of this one and I suddenly realized. I am tenacious because i am strong. I take a lickin' & keep on tickin' because I am strong. WOW. That was a big one.

Three things I love about myself:  how creative I am,  how committed I have been to doing yoga (Day 195 of Adriene's yoga videos) and also how intelligent I am and educated.  I have earned three degrees, including a Bachelor's of Arts in Psychology, a Masters of Education in Bilingual Education as well as a Masters in Psychology and also my sobriety; I have been clean and sober for almost 22 years! 

I also appreciated about the strength it requires to let go as I am in the difficult process of breaking up with my boyfriend whom I have lived with for over two years and am staying with a friend now and feeling very displaced.

But I thought, I will give it a try. It felt great to resume my journey and thinking about things I love about myself was just what I needed to get back to my normal self. I love that I am good at cooking and that I made myself do this today. Thank you so much, Adriene!",UgxvNTdhtT0ciSLLzG54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-11-21T12:28:28Z,0.9972792267799377

Sometimes I don’t see any movement on the scale, but my body tells me that it’s different when I am able to do these things that I couldn’t before. There’s more space, somehow, for everything to fit. I also have more energy. Yoga has got to be magic! 

I love my creativity, and inner strength! I love my family’s ability to always come together and get through the tough stuff. I love my yoga practice, lol.

377.0,"I would have never thought that I'd actually be able to come up with three things that I like about myself ever, but today was a good day and I actually managed: 1. That there are a lot of good people in my life who love and support me, which must mean that I am doing something very right. 2. That I am very determined and hard-working. It's true for a lot of things, but the fact that I do Yoga on the daily now (close to three month habit now! Go me!) is one thing that proves it. 3. It's my 21st birthday next week and reminiscing on what I've been doing so far I realised that I managed to fulfill all the things I aspired to do as a young child. I moved to my favourite city, got into the uni I always wanted to go to, I got an amazing job I love, good friends. I work hard on overcoming mental health issues, so not every day is sunshine and rainbows, but I am in a good place right now and I have to thank myself for that. 
I hope that everybody on here who couldn't come up with a thing knows that that doesn't mean that there is nothing to love about them.

I was learning more about yoga poses in the Internet and I was captured by the advanced poses like Tittibhasana, Kapotasana, Natarajasana, Mayurasana, Eka Pada Koundinyasana I and II, Bhudjapidasana, and so on. I would like to know if you created any practice that can lead me to learn all those poses... IT would be great and I'd like to keep you as my Yoga teacher :) so also if you created any programme of that kind that I can buy, I would be very interested.

I know it's been said a lot in the comments below your videos, but the opportunity to practice yoga through youtube videos is one of the biggest advantages of the internet I found so far. And this is thanks to your clear , patient and accessible teaching style. Thank you Adriene, you're for many people probably the best psychologist and spiritual animal they have. I hope you've got the same 'zen' in your life as you bring to ours, cause it feels great!

475.0,"THIS morning, I came to the mat early because I had a person coming over at 9:30, and I was hoping to have at least my Yoga Revolution session done before the morning rolled into the afternoon.

I have to say, I felt as though I was pushing myself to get to the mat and to get the session done without taking the time to reflect upon why I am doing this yoga revolution for.  I seem to have lost the reason why I am putting myself on the mat everyday, instead it has turned into a challenge of making sure I find the time in my morning for the session, so my mind set is so out of whack from when I started.  I am doing this challenge as a way of finding motivation that I had lost and to work on my wellbeing for at least 30 minutes where I find time for myself without thinking what I need to do as a normally function person.

Adriene asked us ""what is our strength"" and it took me awhile to find the answer but reflecting back on what people have told me about myself, I have to say, I am ""well organised"" ... I am proving each day that I am organised by finding 30 minutes to work out with Adriene and I also have to say another strength is ""being committed"".  I am totally committed to this workout and to achieving the goals I have written in my Holistic Journal that I began writing on the 19 November. I am pushing myself to new levels of health and wellbeing and yesterday, a new goal I am focusing on is to complete a 10 day challenge where I walk 1 mile with Leslie Sansone.  If I can walk that one extra mile in a day and build strength through yoga and also concentrate on my inner wellbeing, I have found the balance in my day. 

I am still struggling with flexibility though this yoga challenge but last night, I realised I could actually cross my leg over to my thight while laying back and I wasn't uncomfortable or lacking breath.  I am sure it is because of my determination to complete 30 minutes of yoga and follow along, even though I am not able to do pigeon pose or many of the flexible poses.  Another strength I didn't know I had is "" determination"".  Today, I was a bit lost as to what to do while Adriene went into pigeon, but I spent time stretching and finding my way on the mat by doing some of the movements that we had been through during the last 3 weeks.  I really like the knee to elbow and so I concentrated on that.  Still moving and being focused and tuning into my breath.

Unfortunately, with only 5 minutes left of the workout, the person arrived at my door.  She was actually early and I had to stop the video.  I felt peeved off to leave the session early but I made sure that when I got home, I would switch back on and finish the session.

After arriving home, I had lunch, and then it was back to finishing off my yoga revolution.  I couldn't believe that the following position, put us on our backs and working on our obliques.  Last night, I thought I could see about doing sit ups and I couldn't get myself up.  I am doing resistance and cardio at home and I thought about adding some abdominal workout to my routine because the only core workout I do is through the yoga revolution but I always felt there was more to do once the 30 minutes is up.  Working on the obliques, for 3 pulses, I realised, that I could do sit ups, I just needed to be more determined and in the right mind set to do it, so after yoga, and my 1 mile work, I got down to the resistance and cardio workout and I incorporated sit-ups and obliques into my training.  Thank you Adriene for putting obliques into the revolution because I am now on a new path when it comes to my fitness regime.  

I am sure, if I didn't mention it to my Doctor that I wanted to do yoga, I wouldn't be where I am today and enjoying the revolution and incorporating what we do into my fitness regime or into my every day and I am seeing the rewards because of my commitment and determination and the fact I am so organised that I can find 30 minutes in my day to be on the mat and find my breath ...",UgxqgL9u69toCPAAXqp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-12-13T05:09:46Z,-0.029172560889095773
476.0,"This was very enjoyable.

For me, the strengths that came to mind when prompted were: I'm organized, I'm creative, and I've made a lot of progress (not just in fitness in the past couple years but in general). I did entertain adding stubborn/determined here. And as I write this comment, I remember that prudence is also one of my key strengths.

This did also bring to mind a book that I picked up when my mom died (this year), I'm not sure how frequently I've mentioned before, called ""Resilient Grieving"" by Lucy Hone. And the one chapter that really stuck with me was on character strengths. So I guess it wasn't as hard for me to find things to list.

I honestly don't know how you can expect me to pull off a form like the one you made on 26:32. It was really frustrating to do and I failed it.

I decided to take yoga because I hoped it would calm me down, but it doesn't seem to be working. Call me cynical or whatever, but I tell truth. Also make no mistake: just because I'm not liking this doesn't mean I'm going to stop. I'm going to continue this revolution until the end. And do not praise me, please.

This led to an amazing conversation where we all told each other what we loved about them, and at the end, we all shared a couple of things we loved about ourselves after being showered in thoughtful, loving comments from the group that practiced. It is pretty amazing to think that a 34-minute yoga practice/ workout led to a conversation that none of us will ever forget and brought us all closer together.

I know I'm late with the series, I'm sorry for that... but I've been recovering from torn ligaments in my ankle. Some days are better than others, but I'm slowly healing and that's what matters. I've been following your videos for a couple of years now and you are seriously the best yoga teacher I've ever had. I follow your practices with both joy and love. Every time I think of giving up, you're getting me through there, making me stronger in both mind and body. I've been feeling really off lately, falling back into depression, self loathing and suicidal thoughts again and there have been many times that I thought I'd be unable to get myself on the mat, but because I know that you (and my yoga practice) have my back I'm able to follow the practice and the flow. You asked us to share what we love about ourselves, and although I couldn't think of something easily while on the mat, you gave me strength to look at my good sides and not only the bad. Thank you for that, I really, really needed that. So that's what I wanted to share today....
- I love that I'm adventurous, and that I'll go wherever life will take me, even when I'm afraid. 
- I love that I'm passionate about helping other people, helping them believe in themselves, how to follow their heart and how to find their inner strength. 
- I love that I've learned how to listen to my inner voice and that I always follow my heart. 
Now.. I normally don't write comments. But I really want to thank you for the good vibes that you're putting out there for all of us. I think you're wonderful and I admire your passion, compassion, strength and humour a lot. Thank you for sharing your love, happiness and passion with us, making us find what feels good. Namaste...

I have my favorite practices of yours that I do when I just don't feel like anything else, but THIS ONE!!!  This is I think my favorite ever that you've done!  I loved how you incorporated strength with a good dose of self-love and fueled our physical strength with the inner muscle of opening to love.  It was beautiful and strong, and I could really feel the difference in how I felt physically because of the mental/emotional work you were guiding us through.  I have been doing quite a bit of internal work the last many years and in the past would have found looking for things I loved about myself excruciatingly difficult, but (even though I did have to think a bit on the last two) now I was quite open to the idea and found attributes fairly easily.  Thank you for putting together this practice and perfectly marrying together the whole mind and body!!

878.0,"Three weeks ago, my dad had a heart attack and I came to stay with him and my mom while he recovers. My parents live in an very rural area. We get no cell signal. It's 5 miles of dirt road from the highway to their house. The hospital Dad had his surgeries at is 90 minutes drive from where they live. My mom has been losing her memory for years now, and she's getting worse by the day. And after being here three weeks, I think that no matter what anybody says, and no matter how they say it, my mom and dad will never move from this place. 

So I've spent the last three weeks dealing with that. I am on my own here with my parents right now. My sister works full-time at a special needs pre-school, so she had to return home. And at some point, I have to go home too. I have a husband and kids waiting for me. Doing these yoga sessions each day I've been here has helped me find some peace in the midst of all this stress and disruption, and Adrienne's comments toward the end of this session about letting go reflect exactly what I've been thinking about these last few days.

Here are my three things:
1) I love that I care so much - both about others and putting time into things that are important to me
2) I love that I am able to speak Spanish. It has brought me so many amazing opportunities and I get so much joy out of using that skill.
3) I love my creativity and all the fun things I am able to use it for.

I'm a mom to an almost three year old and a 7 month old. I'm not always the mom I want to be, but I'm trying. Every day is hard, but I'm still trying. I got behind in this practice because of a really nasty stomach flu, but I didn't stop. I kept trying. I'm potty training an almost three year old boy and it's really hard. It would be easier to just slap a diaper on him, but I don't. I keep trying. Sometimes I just want to yell, and sometimes I get mad and I do yell, but then I take a step back and I remember that he's three and I'm 35... and I apologize to him, and I keep trying. I can't focus as much on the baby as I did with my first, because there's just so much more going on, and at night I apologize for the times I had to let him cry so I could stop his brother from trying to destroy the house or kill himself, and I promise to focus on him with all the energy I have, and then the next day I try.

1064.0,"What I love about myself - In 2016 I had major life events: Stopped working for a school, My husband stopped working for a school, Moved to new house, We opened our own school for deaf and hearing children, My husband finished his degree, We had our second child (boy). As these are all exciting things, it's lots and lots of gruesome work with many hats to wear and in the process, I lost myself a bit; I couldn't find 'my' hat. Last Saturday, I experienced something like a panic attack. I thought it was from a vitamin deficiency. So I made sure to take my vitamins everyday. Another attack hit the next day... and the next day; which turned to having one everyday until I decided to go to the emergency room. I wouldn't let myself believe these were anxiety attacks for I did not feel I have had anxiety.  All my tests came back great and the doc told me I have been having anxiety attacks. That's when I accepted it and decided to reflect on my daily health. For an entire year, I been transitioning my home, my career, my family, while being pregnant- later, with no maternity leave. Ha! All without a day of yoga or meditating. As of last month, I was working so much, I wouldn't eat until 2pm sometimes. I was ignoring my body so much that I didn't see it was shutting down on me until last Saturday. I was so helpless during these attacks and I have so much to do. So much that I want to give to the world.  But my mind became so scrambled. For example,  I would be putting the dishes away, see there is sweeping to be done, set the dish down without putting it away. I started just chasing myself in circles. I had such a hard time through this video, almost laughing that.. I could not find something I love about myself. I kept thinking of my children, or this dream school that I'm building. But they come from 'my passion'. It's funny, in the past I have loved this about myself and others have expressed to me they have recognized my passion. So here I am again, coming back to myself and loving me for my passion. I took many years to build myself, my knowledge and my experience so I can let my passions create beauty in my life and in other's lives. So everyday, I have been and will continue, taking my vitamins and herbal supplements, mediating, finding time outside of work/house, and of course, Yoga with Adriene. I never leave comments on YouTube videos or really anywhere else. But when Adriene suggested leaving a comment ""What I love about myself"" I thought it would be therapeutic for me... and it was. Thanks Adriene. Great yoga today. Great day :)",UgjU4wW2tnKu5HgCoAEC,4.0,22.0,2017-01-22T07:55:39Z,0.08174688753155847
