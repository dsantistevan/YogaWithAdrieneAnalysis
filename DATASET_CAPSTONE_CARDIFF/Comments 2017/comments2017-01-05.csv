In my feet

I got rhythm in my heart and soul

I got rhythm

Hot and sweet

Sometimes rhythm makes me loose control

Ha cha ta cha chow

I want everyone

To have all the fun

That I have

354.0,"Day 5 and only another 2 days until I have been on this yoga journey for a week, and I am really enjoying my time, even if I am still struggling with the poses as we move along but I am not giving up, I am going to continue all the way through.  I have gotten myself into a good routine of finding 30 minutes in my quiet day to do these classes, and although I struggle through, at the end I am happy I stayed with the session to the very end.  It is so easy to give up when you don't have the flexibility or you can not do downward dog but who knows, the next step could be something you can do and this is my journey through this revolution.  I can't reach to the mat and I am not as flexible as Adriene but I am working at my own level, and trying whatever is put in front of me ...  I am treating these session as if I am in an actual yoga class and if I was in a class, I wouldn't walk out because I can't do a pose, and so I have myself in a good place with a routine that is working for me ...

This feels like a journey of Eat, Pray, Love ,,, and at the moment this is Pray, where I honour myself, be true to myself and find my inner self through commitment, pride and wellbeing.  Commitment, in staying on this path to the very end. Pride, where I am amazed with what I am capable of doing and Wellbeing, giving myself the time to heal and improve through adapting a healthy lifestyle.

1058.0,"Hi Adrienne! Just like to say how much I'm enjoying this course. I've done a few of your other courses (30 days of yoga etc), but I've been only following your channel for 6-8 months, so it's exciting to be doing it with other people! What a sense of power!

My only problem is I'm in the UK, and my yoga time is somewhere between 6-7:30am, which means you haven't posted today's video today. So, here it's January 6th and I'm on Day 5 which isn't a big problem, but it's sad to feel like you're always playing catch-up. Particularly with the emails! I got the the email this morning (sort of day 6, though I'm doing day 5) for day 4 - how does that work? The emails seem like they're meant to be read BEFORE the videos, or am I wrong? 

This wasn't meant to be a moan-y comment at all - it's the first comment I've left I think! Which fits well because today I can say it was my best ever practice. Tomorrow might be rubbish, but never mind - I still experienced this. I loved the opportunity to create your own flow.

Thank you. Namaste <3",UgjgbRLyI_g7XXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-06T07:41:51Z,0.9973224997520447

1133.0,"I know that in all likelihood no one will get to the end of this comment because it's way too long, but dammit, I'm posting it anyway! 

I was a pretty dedicated yogi up until several months ago (moving a few times and setback from mental health issues made things difficult) so when I saw that Adriene was doing yet another of her awesome 30 (or 31 in this case) day programs I knew that it would be the perfect kick to get back on the mat in a meaningful way.  I was a day behind as I started January 2nd (I won't get into the very inexcusable reasons why I wasn't on my mat for the 1st, but I'm sure you can imagine) and as I did Day 4 first thing this morning I figured I'd try to catch up and do Day 5 this evening as well. 

I really just wanted to say that I can't believe the difference between this morning's practice and Day 5's! It could just have something to do with the fact that I have more energy in the evenings generally, but I felt so much more in tune with myself with this practice. I was having more fun, wasn't internally yearning for a child's pose, and felt myself flowing through the vinyasas almost effortlessly--I almost felt like my old practicing self again! I know I still have a long way to go before I'm back to where I was, but this has me eager to continue with the 31 days because I know how much better I'm going to feel about myself at the end of it--in mind, body, and consciousness. 

Anyway, all this to say thank you, Adriene!",UggLb_9rHLadlngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-06T02:55:30Z,0.9927026033401489
