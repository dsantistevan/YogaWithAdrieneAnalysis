0.0,"My ""Yoga With Adriene"" Testimonial: For so many years I bought into the ""no pain no gain"" belief system of fitness. I believed that if I pushed my body through callisthenics, through complicated exercises, through running daily, etc. then and only then would I be able to get ""the body I wanted"". I am ashamed to say how long it has taken me to realize that that was a lie (at least for me it was). In September (I'm a teacher, so September always seems like a new year to me) I decided all of that wasn't working for me. I knew I needed more stretching in my life, I'm getting older and the old body was just getting stiffer. I then committed to three things fitness-wise: Yoga every day, some form of cardio every day (I still run, but only 3 days a week tops), and more vegetables in my diet. I can't believe the change I've seen in my body in 4 short months. It's amazing how strong I feel, how many compliments I've received, and how great my clothes fit (even going down a size). I am so grateful that I came across your original 30 days of Yoga videos. My life has truly never been the same since then. Thank you Adriene for giving us this gift every day. Blessings to you!",UgjvntVhjLkAU3gCoAEC,18.0,563.0,2017-01-22T13:20:05Z,0.997664213180542

Today's practice was especially transformative for me because yesterday we did some good strength building, so I felt strong enough to go for a longer distance run than I have in a while.

I remember looking at all the asanas in the thumbnail photos thinking maybe I was being too ambitious, but that I was going to try anyways. I don’t regret giving this a chance at all, and I’ve loved every minute of watching my body transform is many pleasant and unexpected ways. 

Since my body has changed a bit, I spent this practice trying to figure out and play with my new center. I don’t have to pull in my knees and legs to the side anymore, so I’m getting used to pulling in through the middle. It’s weird, lol. I feel like this was gentle for my body by respecting that it changed and trying to understand the changes... am I right or am I reaching? Lol.

140.0,"Adriene, your dear practices, I have participated in them off and on since I was 15 years old. I am now 18 years old and they always help to keep me footed when life is stringing me along. I’m very sensitive to everything, admittedly. These last couple of years I have gone through a time in my life where all of my friends were depressed and had a burnout, pressing myself out of a burnout while moving countries and declining myself of any screen time for 2 months at the age of 16, rehabilitating myself from an eating disorder and introduced low carb diets into my life, had my life spun around, met someone to give me hope for my future and taken me to spend Christmas across the world in Texas, moved 2 times more, found a definite meaning to my life, found god and sang at my best friend’s beautiful wedding. 
I’ve crumbled and I’ve been told I’ve saved someone’s life. I have learnt to survive without always needing to be on the go, physically, some where. I have found God and I have conquered through family situations where I have had to flee our home with a caravan to not have my mother hit by my uncle. I have seen my wonderful nephews and nieces say they love me and felt love for the first time in my life since childhood and I have for the first time learnt to see lovingly in my body. And even though it is such a travel, and even though merely yesterday I suffered an anxiety attack on my friend’s graduation party so I had to leave.. Your grounding, soothing and miraculous spirit we get to take part of must be heaven sent. You are truly special and I have always seen myself in and been fond of you for how you shine and care for us here. I’ve found myself crying on my mat. Laying there without nothing but self loathe. Laying there with nothing but self love for the first time in the week. I have found myself caring for my body like I never had and I have found myself walking straighter through life than ever with it, and sagging down into a decreased sense of self worth without it. I have seen how you grow us. Grow us heartfelt and grow us into positive sprouts on the paths of our loved ones. Therefore I must lay a short text of praise for you on this channel. 
I can start writing a book of how you have helped me care for my body. 
This wonderful afternoon however, the sun is shining. & Even though it took me 1 hour as it usually does to start your video - I am never in doubt you change my life with your gentle and beautiful caring energy leading us on our own right paths destined for us in life by tuning into ourselves and finding peace when our world finds turmoil. ‘Everything is as it should be’ has stuck for me too. I am perfect as I am today even if realizing it myself takes courage. So today, when the sun is shining after I have been filled with a piece of this world’s needed love - I will lift my feet up & down and run as if my eating disorder never could have mattered to me yesterday or the day before. I can try again. I always want to try again. I am merely able to send my gratitude and bow. I hope you for the rest of your life can find peace in the lives you have changed. 
All the beautiful best for the rest of your journey in life & on the mat, Adriene. When your time here is passed is uncertain for me, but I hope you will stay lively and hearty for the rest of it. You have a lot to offer the world and you are letting us have a piece of your shine. I hope you find peace, love and hope wherever you go. Always,

145.0,I recently underwent surgery to have a lobe of my lung removed after the discovery of a rare tumour in my right lung. I had a thoracotomy (where they cut between your ribs to get to your lung) so they could remove the tumour and a section of my lung. I have been doing YWA videos daily for the last 2 years and this video is the first I have done in 2 weeks since my operation! I have literally never been so grateful for my breath and it brings a whole new meaning to the breathing aspect of yoga. I'm still working on getting my lung capacity back but I know that building my yoga practise back up gently will work wonders. I had a little trouble with the twists but i'll get back to normal soon! Thank you once again Adriene for sharing your gift with us and allowing yoga to be more accessible in our lives ~ Namaste 🙏🏼💖💚,UgzTxRM3JpoZ4Ho64_x4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-05-01T15:30:13Z,0.9984694123268127
146.0,"I did this gorgeous yummy practice with my partner this morning! As a teacher I love hearing how each different person experiences asana, because everyone feels differently, and is going through and coming from different places. Being gentle to yourself is a phrase that usually makes my partner roll his eyes or chuckle when I say it, but lying in stillness, in supta badha konasana, while I’m massaging my (VERY TIGHT, ow omg!) hip creases, and trying to put myself in my partner’s shoes, or any cis man in today’s USA. I LOVE the tool of being silent, not responding to the idea of being gentle, just observing what it would be like to be gentle. Approach new and maybe unfamiliar things with curiosity rather than judgment. Silence and kindness are such powerful tools. So much food for thought, so much love in the room between my practice my partner and this beautiful sequence with your beautiful words.

161.0,"I came to the mat at the earlier time of 8:00am ready for day 22.  

I didn't expect it to be a ""rest day"" because every day has felt like a rest day as I also treat myself kindly and gentlely as a way moving through my wellness journey.  People, professionals in the wellness industry, have said to me, to treat myself kindly because of the journey I had been on.  Don't be too harsh on yourself and for me, I have bought that thought to the mat.  I push myself to my limits but if I need to hold back, I do, I find my breaking point and I ease off but still continue with the session.

Today, I felt like pushing myself to my full potential so while we were on our backs, stetching the thighs and harmstrings, I was happy to lay back and do some leg curls and crunches and work on my core.  It was a great little work out and something I needed to kick off my day.  I am becoming confident in my abilities on the mat and I am taking it upon myself to move at my own pace and to work at levels that suit me.  

At the beginning of the session, Adriene had us bend ourselves forward and because I have such trouble crossing my legs, I was happy to go for another pose but still going for the stretch.  I have to find the time in my day, to just learn to cross my legs and sit because I don't have the flexibility and I am sure I will get to the position once again.  I never sit on the floor and cross my legs because it reminds me of being back in primary school and now it just seems to be the right time to re-educate myself.  I must admit I feel as though I have good posture as I never slump in a chair and when I am at the computer my shoulder are never slumped forward and just from sitting at a chair has helped me through the sitting poses during this revolution.  All Adriene is doing to making sure we continue to have good posture even when we are sitting on a mat.  I also have to confess, I am one of those people who hate sitting on stool.  I find my posture is weak and so I never choose to sit on a stool whenever possible and so I am at times finding myself correcting my posture when I find I am going backwards..

With all the strengthening of the core and working on our innerself, I am feeling good everytime I come to the mat and leave the mat and today, I realised that you can rest but at the same time, you can find time to do some strengthening if you want to push yourself that little bit further.",UgwfLkM-o6fI5CDb0L14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-12-13T22:59:31Z,0.6764565646103846

I started the practice distracted, but midway something just shifted and my overall mood evolved into pleasant acceptance and mindfulness in such a big way that I couldn't help smiling until the end of the video??Does this happen to anyone else or am I bi-polar? Lol. 

Adriene, your thoughtful guidance and these yoga movements are moving mountains in people's lives, I hope you know. I now know I want yoga as a permanent part of my life.

219.0,"Adriene, dear Adriene. Its weird, cause somehow I feel like your a close friend. Lately I've really found the love and happiness that life actually contains - which unfortunately is just so very hidden by society's way of thinking: the right body, the right education, the right job - making 'the right' decision over and over again in your life. Luckily, I've found that 'whats right' will never become clear to me, without a deep connection with my inner-self. For so many years - almost my whole youth up until now - I've just had this feeling of, that I could never do 'it' right, the way that it was 'supposed' to. No matter how much effort I put into my fitness and healthy lifestyle, how well I did in school, how much right clothes and accesories I bought - I could just never find that feeling of satisfaction and peace. Your yoga videos has made it so much easier for me to find an inner peace, and keep on remembering being honest with myself, noticing how i feel, doing what just feels good - without no other reason. You make me feel good, you make me smile and laugh beacause of your random jokes and cutes little songbreakouts - so like everyone else, and I dont even know, if your actually reading this, but I just wanted to thank you as well. I've never been this happily consistent to anything before, without forcing me to do it, cause that 'was the right thing to do'.

276.0,"Still trying to catch up! Hopefully I'll be on time before the challenge ends. 
I'll be honest, yoga looked like such a boring practice until a few years ago. It was actually my favorite YouTube personal trainer Kelli (any Fitnessblender fam?) who highly recommended stretching and using yoga to improve flexibility, help with muscle soreness, etc. Nothing as meaningful as what Adriene invites us to explore in every video, but I would've never appreciated the gentleness and mindfulness of yoga if I had not started with the high impact routines, which I still swear by. For me yoga alone is not enough, but it definitely is the element that was missing to my fitness journey, especially from a mental and spiritual perspective.

330.0,"Towards the end of today's practice, when Adriene talked about being kind to yourself (and others, of course), I began to cry because I know in my heart that I've never been able to be truly kind to myself--even on my good days there's still that nagging sense of guilt and damaging self-deprecation at the choices I've made in my life that have me far behind where I thought I'd be at this point in my life. But as someone who has struggled for years with mental health issues, I'm trying to forgive myself--and, yes, be kind to myself--as I know I can never move forward if I don't do both. It's never really easy, and I know it will be a lifelong challenge, but this journey has me feeling more positive about my present and future than I have in a long time.

The practise made me feel calmer though, and even though i hold very few things dear to me, things are things.
