143.0,Best one so far for me - I haven't been feeling it for the last couple of days and landed on my mat this morning irritated and edgy;  but loved opening my heart and discovering new found (if slightly wobbly) strength in a high lunge and most amazing of all now have the strength in my arms to lower from plank without collapsing and even just about push myself back up again!  Thank you Adriene - loving the Revolution most of all and might just start it again from day 1 as soon as I finish.  <3,Ugxmc3508VG4o-d25rF4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2018-07-29T09:04:36Z,0.9998008608818054

160.0,"I can not believe I have been on this yoga path for 28 days and today, instead of coming to the mat early, I made it in the late afternoon and by that point this is what I needed.

I am sure that the last few videos are not very long ones because it feels as though we come to the mat and 10 minutes later the session finishes.  

I am counting down the last days and I am going to take on the next challenge because I am feeling as though these 30 minutes I spend doing these practices have helped me through my day.  I had been lacking motivation when it comes to exercising and for other things in my life, but by doing this challenge it made me committed to keep coming back each day and spending 30 minutes focusing on my wellbeing.  It is also at a really good pace and at times the moves are challenging but I stay with the programme as there are things that are easy to do.  It has given me a new perspective as to what yoga is and how it can be used in your everyday.  I am definitely more aware of my breathing and from doing these moves, I am finding that I am able to do things I hadn't been able to do in a long time, especially when it comes to squatting down and not becoming breathless.",Ugxhs_CGkQ69dTjKVs94AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2017-12-20T10:54:12Z,0.9948996901512146

I've been doing this practice in August, one of the hottest months of summer here. There have been days when my back sticks to my mat with sweat. There have been days when sweat is literally trickling down my body. There have been multiple days when I've had to do it directly in front of a giant fan. There have been days when I've cried with frustration trying to hold poses that push my limits. There have been days when I just couldn't go through with a pose that I'd done multiple times before. There have been days when I've lost my balance and toppled into walls. And beds. And dressers. And couches. There were four days when I was on vacation, and I brought my yoga mat with me so I could do yoga every day I was away from home. I've had no idea what's kept me coming back until Adriene said today that we are working with our bodies and not on our bodies. My initial goal starting this 31 days was to work on flexibility. Work on flexibility. My new goal, starting today and hopefully continuing beyond the 31 days, is to work WITH my flexibility--in my body and in my life in general.

242.0,"What I love about yoga is that there are days when I really don't feel like getting on the mat, but those are really the most important days because it's a day to just observe the mind really not wanting to practice.  

A day or a few days later, I'll be craving the mat again, knowing that at some point there will be the days that I really don't feel like the mat but understanding that's all part of the experience and part of a 'normal' mind.  I think this is why people give things up so easily (exercise, yoga, diets etc) - they hit that natural patch of 'demotivation' and throw in the towel when those are the days where you really learn so much about yourself. 

Today, I loved and craved this practice.  Last week, I was struggling to get on the mat and my mind felt tired and frustrated.  Both days, equally valuable.",UggwQxIg39fUF3gCoAEC,0.0,3.0,2017-02-12T07:28:24Z,0.9927831888198853
