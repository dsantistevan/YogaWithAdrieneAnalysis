She gave me the foundation to now be able to play in inversions, balances, backbends, twists and splits I never imagined I could embody. But more importantly, she so kindly taught me the tools I needed to develop a sense of self, the world, and a place in that world that continues to promote flourshing on and off the matt.

90.0,"Adriene, one of the things I love most about following your yoga videos is the way you always encourage people to work at their own pace, find what feels good in their own bodies, and to experiment and play with the poses.  In the past in other yoga classes I wouldn't have felt the freedom and actual joy at moving my body ""outside the box"" of whatever pose was on the table -- but now, if you say ""child's pose"" (for example), and I feel like massaging my head while there or stretching hips back and forth, or enjoying namaste shark fin instead of active arms, etc,  I know it's ok, and it feels so great to honor what my body needs.

143.0,"I remember the time when I was incredibly stressed and stiff and didn't know how to relax.
My family and friends recommended me to do yoga but I didn't believe in it.
Instead I used to have prejudices that kept me from trying it out.
I found that it was strange.

Eventually, when things went really bad, I joined  a public class and tried to let go. 
I had to get used to it but then I started to enjoy going to yoga classes.
In shavasana I learned to relax completely which was something I wasn't familiar with. 
It was pretty fascinating though I realised that going to a public yoga class once a week wasn't 100% what my body and soul needed.
So I browsed through YouTube and found your channel.

The more I let go the more things started to change.
To be honest, it was the best thing to happen to me.
I was amazed by all the new sensations I felt and even my mindset changed.
Now, I am more relaxed and I can better deal with anxiety.
I approach people and situation in a different manner.
I've become more gentle and kind.
It feels like yoga has brought out my good sides more.
In the past, I hadn't realised how shallow my breath was so that I was quite shocked by how good breathing feels now.
In addition, my body and posture have changed.
I've become stronger and more toned and flexible.

I'd haver never expect that I'd do yoga every day.
The more I practice yoga...
...the stronger I become
...the more I learn
...the more I find myself
...the deeper I breath
...the more I open up
...the better I can let go
...the more I can serve others
...the more confident I become
...the better I feel
...the more I grow


I am extremely grateful for having dscovered a whole new perspective, Adriene.
You're a wise person I truly admire and I can't stress enough how much sunshine you've brought to my life.

167.0,"I experienced so much resistance this morning to practice day 4.
I felt/thought things like: ""mehh...this session is too slow.."", ""meh...I'm gonna do something else..."", ""I am stupid for having so much resistance..."".

At some point, I just played day 4, but just gazing at it feeling no good Juju, no Mambo, no Mojo, no nothing.

But at some moment I started to accept the moment. Accept the lack of motivation.
 That opened up the situation. And then I felt like:""hmm...maybe this IS what I need"".

Played day 4 from the start. And actually experienced one of the nicest sessions ever...

I realize yoga for me was way too much about stretching. This session made me experience the importance of awareness, concious slow movements. 
I also felt emotions of loneliness and even cried a while. 
But I feel better, more at ease now.

I always wake up with a mindset of ""you must do something!"". But there isn't awareness in that.
Being more aware is where the magic happens.

And saying that/seeing that out loud is connecting dots to other parts of my life. Learning to keep the practice going--even on my days off--so that my most committed practice is taking care of myself. Also learning, and remembering, that if I do take a day or two off--there will be those growing period where all hope seems lost.

Despite doing yoga daily with Adriene for almost a year, I wasn't feeling as good as I'd like or getting the weight loss, and overall health improvements I was hoping for. Three and a half years ago, I started having a smoothie for breakfast every day, and one of the recommended ingredients was peanut butter. After doing some research, I discovered peanut butter is one of the worst possible foods we can eat, and many people have peanut/peanut butter sensitivities without realizing. I cut out the PB, and since then I feel better, have more energy on and off the mat, am losing weight, and best of all, my overall health seems so much better.

I walked this morning because of the cool weather, then after lunch, instead of sitting on the couch, I switched onto day 4 and took the class slowly and at my own pace.  I am taking every day as it comes but I am trying to keep the motivation going even if it I am moving slow because I am feeling so tired.  

While I was waling yesterday, I came to the realisation that if I was doing gym classes, I wouldn't be able to cope for the hour.  At least with these half an hour sessions, I am  stretching and moving by doing this yoga revolution challenge, I am getting to be at a place where I can say, I am doing exercise but at my own pace.  

I feel as though I am on a good journey for my wellness.  Of course a long way to go, but at least I am focused on me, and challenging myself with each class because I surprised myself through doing this class, with the ability to hold myself up with one arm and one leg and able to plank - which is a long way from day 1.

527.0,all I can say is YUM-MY ;-) Really was perfect today as I took a little detour 2 days ago to do the yoga for a broken heart. Had a long nap yesterday as my yoga practice (not easy to give self permission for that so YAY!) and today this low to the ground practice was perrrrrfect. Question Adriene... I'm 5'10 1/2 and have very long legs. I find moving from down dog to lunge in a graceful manner really difficult. I cant get my leg up very far. Have you got in your archives any video that would show how to modify that so that I'm doing it in connection and not rushing because I feel like a clumsy dolt? ;-) I'd sure appreciate it.

537.0,"Hey, Adriene, love your work, your style and your focus - and I've been loving just getting into this ""30 days of Yoga"" series you've created.

Thought I should mention though, that the ad-revenue thing you've got before your videos serves-up some adverts that completely go-against the healthy/positive-energy focus of your work.

eg: The un-skippable advert that just finished playing was for an YouTube RED series/film(?) called ""The Thinning"" about an horrific, corrupt future in which grade-through-high-school students who don't pass a standardized final exam are executed.

I realized it's important to be compensated for your work, and I relieve that YouTube is now a behemoth and very hard to get ahold of a real person there, and I also realize that their adverts are served-up somewhat randomly... but... if there were a way to have their ad selection more sculpted toward the video content, it would be sooooo much better.

Must go curl up with a cup of herbal tea to detox from the mental/emotional negativity thrown at me by that YouTube Red advert before I can come back and do a good Yoga session with you...

730.0,I just recently started a yoga class twice a week at the YMCA and I liked it more than I thought I would.  So I wanted to start doing yoga daily and came across this 31 day Yoga.  I am glad because I am liking this also.  I do it at the end of the day and it seems to help me let go of the stress of the day.  I am still not able to do all the poses easily.  The sitting back on my feet is still NOT happening for me otherwise I am okay on the flexibility. I don't know how long before I start feeling my core strengthening.  In the past year I have lost 130 pounds and I have about 50 pounds more to lose.  Everyone keeps telling me that I will not find weight loss in doing yoga.  I guess we will find out.  I also still do workouts 3-5 times a week.  THANKS Adriene for keeping me motivated towards my goal!,UgjgNOoUNkBmCHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-02-02T07:06:01Z,0.9250612258911133

I had periods where I did it every day and periods where for weeks I  didn't practice at all. But I always come back and get reminded how much it helps me. Lately I've been going through a rough patch in my life, and this time I find that after every practice my emotions get all stirred up. I feel sad, and sometimes I cry even during the practice. Is that something that has happened to some of you other yogis? And is it a sign I am not in the right place when I practice and doing something wrong,  or is it a good thing and it means the practice is actually helping me some way?

Still today's work required a lot of wrist strength and stability and I definitely had to take a few breaks to stretch them out. So this was not as ""flowy"" and chill as I am used to but it was just what I needed to break out of this funky funk I've been feeling especially after yesterday's Friday the 13th.

Just from the first practice, I reminded myself to not focus on the negative and to be thankful for all the good. Thank you for all of your videos Adriene!

Although I am a few days behind, one thing I can say is that I am so much less sore after my runs because of this yoga practice. I feel confident that I can get back to and surpass my previous running personal records if I continue to focus on my yoga, especially my breathing techniques. Honestly, I've been to a few yoga classes (nothing stuck) but I think what I like about your videos are that they are truly easing you in and making me find what's best for me and my personal yoga goals, which makes me hope that I can really get to where I want physically and mentally.

Since I started regularly practicing with you I've found myself energetic, curious and playful both on and off the mat - I've seen an immense improvement in my mood and less attachment to things that I used to think I needed (like coffee each morning!) on a daily basis. I sleep better, I think more clearly, my eating is healthier and balanced.

A lot of other teachers make me feel like I should have sat down and researched the terms and what everything means. Adriene not only makes you feel welcome and special, but also makes a point to teach and to let you be. She emphasizes that each practice belongs to us. It's not about how we look, but how we feel and how we are connected, with ourselves and the energies around us. That's what I've always been missing. I did all of her foundation segments (some a few times) as well as a few of the other sequences, but these past few days have been on a whole different level. Yes, I still struggle (sometimes a lot) as I am a shorter, yet heavier girl. However, I can already feel my body changing and I feel my Prana, my energy, and it feels so good to feel so good.

Throughout the year, I really let myself succumb to the hopelessness that I felt daily, which really took a toll on my body mentally, emotionally, and physically. Through this practice, I'm finding strength and empowerment for not only dealing with my anxiety and depression but also hope for maybe getting to a point where I can overcome it. As I overcome on the mat, I hope that I'm able to overcome in life as well.

I also joined a yoga studio in my neighborhood but still practice with your videos on 6 days of the week. I wonder: How long do YOU practice yoga each day? I'm trying to get a feeling for the right amount of practice that is healthy and beneficial (I know, there probably is no such thing as ""the right"" amount for everybody). For example, today I was still sore from yesterday's very intense 1.5 hours of yoga at my studio, but I did Day 3 and Day 4 of Revolution and went for a half hour interval run. I'm just wondering if this is too much or if it just seems much to me (after not doing a lot of sports for a while). ;) So yeah, please be so kind and share how much you practice and if you do other sports as well. :) Thank you and namast√©! <3",UghW0GdLS3rUungCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-04T19:17:43Z,0.9987855553627014

1548.0,"Last summer, I turned 50, let go of myself for a while and by the holidays, I had gained 20 pounds. I cringed when I got on that scale so I asked for a Fitbit for Christmas, tweaked my nutrition, stumbled across Revolution and immediately subscribed. I have done yoga and dance, on and off in the past 20 years, so I was excited to embrace this commitment in my home. 
I began this Revolution series on day one. Day one was a gentle reminder to movements, day two and three gave me awareness of my neglected muscles that were being engaged with a mild soreness that was better each morning. Today, as I was into the routine for about 5 minutes, I felt like crying. Not from body pain or frustration, but more of a ""I'm doing something really good for myself"" realization. Of course, after a few seconds, that sensation had to pass so I could refocus and continue on the movements. But that was a joy-moment that I only experienced one other time when dancing. 
Your teaching is clear and well explained. I look forward to each morning's adventure and can't wait to see the better me at the end of this month! Thank you for helping all of us!",UgiS-wrbdfEFoXgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2017-01-04T13:31:55Z,0.9963889122009277

1576.0,"We keep moving, through the power of yoga we keep mooning
Going through our phases, goodbye to the sad and the anxious
We elevate, regenerate, not looking back, but learning from our mistakes
Cultivate the prana in the third eye, we can never fall even if we're blind
On or off the field, still reaching for our goals
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
Good vibes are worth more than all the riches
You were the king, never putting anyone on crucifixes
Still spreading the word, even past your earthly existence
You puff puff passed all your energy, never dissing
Bypassed all the bias and the -isms
Your legacy is stronger than ever, patiently waiting for 2047",UghFd-wJly-PBHgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2017-01-04T12:06:20Z,0.9942119717597961

I wish I could like your videos a million times. I just wanted to thank you for showing much more of what yoga is than what is seen today on youtube, instagram, etc. I believe you are one of the few on social media who really stresses the fact that yoga is not only about doing ""cool"" things (such as inversions and being as flexible as a rubber band), but mostly is about mind to body connection and Finding What Feels Good.
I wish you all the best for this new year.
