I used to just pick random videos from Adrienne to do but I finally decided to commit to a challenge and it's bringing a calm and sense of center I never felt before. I look forward to the new video each day and I used to skim through her videos before doing them to see if I can do it which was ultimately cultivated a habit of self doubt. For this challenge, I decided to stop doing that and to allow each day to be a sweet surprise. If you are also picking random videos, please consider doing the challenge!!

16.0,"Adriene - I've followed you on several 30 day yoga journeys, and we have to talk about your choice of doing squats. 

Squats are unhealthy for those with knee problems - and as someone who's recovered from a knee injury, you should know that. 

You offer an alternative pose to almost everything except squats. I hate stopping my practice in the middle because my arthritic knees cannot not physically do a squat - and no, yoga blocks do not help. And dropping my heels is not the problem - it's the pain in my knees.

Please teach us another pose.",Ugw48SA3tLZlyBO2r9l4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2021-08-03T18:20:28Z,-0.9568480849266052

19.0,"I have been practicing with Adriene on and off for a few years, but in 2021 I have gotten on the mat every single day since January 1. Even if it was just a short 8-minute bedtime sequence or simple hip stretches when I was sick. TODAY, during this Revolution practice (which I did back when it first came out), I rolled up and back as if it was second nature. It was an intense feeling of freedom and ease. A little TRULY does go a long way. So if you ever wondered what would happen if you hopped on the mat everyday, I encourage you to give it a try. May your heart be whole and your song be sung. 😌",UgxnG17oiZd6-SyM8ad4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-07-07T20:37:31Z,0.9981492757797241

This flow was wonderful! And your message is awesome! I am slowly getting back to my yoga practice and I've been feeling a little frustrated that I am not as flexible or strong as I was a few months ago because I was ill for quite some time, but your message reminded me to honour where I am, and that I should be grateful for what my body can do. I kind of hesitated to do my yoga practice today because I was feeling lazy, but I'm so glad I pushed through.

Every time is different, my body has changed over the months ( I’ve been doing your videos on ( almost) a daily basis for 18 months now, my mood has changed and it feels even more wonderful as I discover new sensations in my body while doing poses I know. I love all the 30 day series but there’s something about the revolution one that feels unique, fresh and special ( maybe because it was my first “live” one in January last year).

226.0,"Hi Adriene! I wanted to start yoga because after having my clinical anatomy class (I'm a med student) I learned about each muscle and their specific movements and really started to notice how my body moves with each step and action I take. So my friend introduced me to your videos and I just started your revolution 3 days ago and I already feel such a difference spiritually and physically! I always prolonged starting yoga because it seemed so hard to jump into not knowing where to start, but your videos make it so easy to follow and understand each pose and what you should get out of each one, even the in-between movements! It has been an amazing journey so far into the yoga world and I'm only just getting started! Thank you so much for your videos! You're an inspiration :) Namaste!",UggrZDBR9-jNZngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-05-28T08:12:08Z,0.9985170960426331

I was in a tough place in my life but now I'm ready and I have the strength to continue on and I thank you because you are a part of my journey.

Not to mention that when I'm at work I'm a psychiatric nurse at an inpatient adolescent hospital. Life is stressful on my best day with children & job & injuries to juggle . I stumbled upon Adriene's videos and I am finding something I lost, or maybe I never really had. Empowerment, strength, appreciation for my mind and body... I'm amazed and wake up each day excited to see how my yoga experience will be that day. Only on day 3 of the revolution ( after completing many of her other beginner videos & falling in love ❤️) but I can already see how this is truly a journey, a practice, something to be proud of. Adriene-I love you, your peaceful, supportive energy, and your ability to make me feel like I'm completely at ease- it's not about the pose, it's about how it feels for you.

317.0,"Wasn't a fan of today's practice. The first 2 days, as well as another beginner yoga practice I followed on this channel, finally made me think that maybe yoga was for me. That maybe it was doable, and it didn't have to be agony, like in many other videos as well as yoga classes I tried to follow. Today I almost gave up. The first movement was SO painful on my ankles, no matter how I tried to relieve them - I still feel them throbbing right now. And then there was 30 minutes of very ab and wrist heavy practice, and when I thought I was finally done there came some movements that reminded me of the pilates 100. I turned off the video at 29 minutes to get a drink because I was really not in the mood for lying on my mat pretending to be relaxed today (maybe a mistake). Hope tomorrow I'll feel better about it again, maybe it's just something I have to get over. Or maybe my mood played a role.

In addition to physical therapy, I did your Yoga for the Feet video every day for months and other videos as I gained more mobility. Now after months of yoga and physical therapy, I can feel my feet and ankles are much stronger now. I can walk my dog again, I can sleep at night without waking up four or five times and I can start losing weight and living a more healthy life. Today, I am on day three of the yoga revolution. I was actually able to do the squat and lifting your arms in a prayer pose at 22:57 that I physically could not have done months ago, I almost cried. Through putting in the time, I have already been able in short time to transform my body. I am excited to continue the Yoga Revolution and see what other changes happen.

I wish I had one of those amazing stories that would say how incredible it was and that my child was inspired by the calm and sat next to me and attempted to mimic some of the poses. It wasn't at all like that.  There were some great moments and then there were moments where I had to pause the practice.

I have done your January camps for the last two years and last year's camp really did the trick for me as it established a daily practice that I have maintained all year. Even if I only do 15 minutes a day some days, I still do it every day. This is extra important for me as I've been recovering from a bad SI injury for the past 3 years. I am overly flexible so your continued admonishment to maintain core strength is indispensable. I also love your kindness and humour. These are two of the greatest tools I use in my teaching of classical singing. I've sent all of my students to your YouTube page because you help us to cultivate acute body awareness, incredible mind-focus and kindness towards ourselves...all indispensable for singing and life!

I have a question Adriene. I follow YWA since 2 years and am used to your wonderful pose' hovering cat' with top of the feet pressing flat into the ground. I like the pose a lot to connect and feel the power within. These last 3 days we do the pose while pressing into the toes and heels up. I like that too and I am curious if it matters, what the difference is or other reasons to choose for flat feet or on toes.

I had a MRI scan on my left shoulder and today doctor confirmed its rotator cuff tear at my tendor was bearable until if I need to lift up something at my side or from behind, even exercise if need to put weight on my left should it will be painful.

Currenly i am on physio therapy, hopefully it will help. Right now I am doing what I can do follow your videos and loving it. Do you have any videos to help rotator cuff tear shoulder strenthening?

844.0,"I had joined karate two years ago with the intention of being a better person mentally and physically but after a year of classes I quit because my sensei was rude to me and my family and I wasn't getting what I wanted. A few months later I thought about doing yoga so I watched one of your videos for beginners and I achieved what I had wanted in 5 weeks of yoga than 1 year of karate. I was much more flexible, stronger and calmer. I've only been doing yoga and stuff since June, 2016 but I feel so much more alive and I'm happy with my body right now but I know that I can still be better so I will keep setting goals and achieving them. I thank you, Adriene for just about all of it ❤",UgiJV4RXmeW75XgCoAEC,1.0,273.0,2017-01-03T07:09:12Z,0.9962555170059204
