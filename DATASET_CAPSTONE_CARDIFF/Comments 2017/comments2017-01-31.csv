A few days ago, I thought on the last day I'd leave a comment and it would say something along the lines of how much I didn't like downward facing dog when I started and now it's one of my favorites. 

I thought that was the journey I was on. 

But this? 

I did not expect this at all.

 I've never consciously thought of myself as a yogi. 

""Yogi's choice"" never referred to me. 

It wasn't something I thought about, my mind just registered it as you speaking to your audience andhaving the freedom of movement and thought but didn't personally identify myself as a yogi. 

But this practice... 

Everyday I showed up it was to be told what to do and how to move. 

Today I showed up as a student awaiting instructions and instead was met as a peer, with a silent invitation to join if I so chose.

This practice stirred something deep inside that hasn't seen the light of day in a long time...

Even Benji showing up. The silent encouragement before crow.

This was not what I expected... but I think it may have been what I needed.

Thank you for guiding me on this journey. I have no words.

Namaste.",UggWx5vdIrIuvXgCoAEC,17,1121,2017-02-01T04:28:41Z,-0.9803311228752136

But perhaps I've got much more used to the longer sessions in this series because when the 34 minutes were up and the video ended I knew I needed at least another five minutes to finish doing what my body needed.

Thank you so much, Adriene, for creating Revolution and this safe space where you engage us to be in the moment, to trust and love ourselves, and to show up on the mat, as little goes a long way. I am feeling more calm, more secure and want to return to the moment more and more often! :-)

118,"I started doing yoga in March. A friend sent me the HOME January journey and I fell in love with yoga almost instantly. Never before had I found a way to exercise and move my body that actually felt good and I could commit to - but I did with yoga. I fully expected to give up in the middle of Home, as I usually did with everything else... but here I am in December, still doing it daily - or as much as I can, at least.
Day 31 of Home was miserable for me. I couldn't shake loose. I panicked when I heard I was left on my own, closed the video a few minutes in and found another one where I could be guided. So when I saw another Day 31 in the December calendar, I knew there was a challenge coming. Or at least a check point of my growth.
I didn't do yoga the last 2-3 days (I turned 20 yesterday!), so I was late with the calendar but still determined to finish the Revolution sequence. I started with day 30... then 31.
And I did it. There was no panic, no feeling of loss or being alone. And it felt amazing. So free, so natural; I didn't even feel when the 35 minutes passed. There wasn't a single moment where I had to stop and ask myself ""what next?""; I didn't look at the video but I knew where I was going in every moment. Yes, sure, the transitions were clumsy, I went back and forth a few times, I think I didn't exactly even out some sequences... But it felt good nonetheless. I did some balancing postures and any time I felt the balance slipping, I told myself to trust that the ground is there to catch me. Trust. Trust. It kept echoing in my head.
I guess this is what I learned in the last few months. How to trust and listen to myself, how to not be uncomfortable with making decisions on my own. All this is still difficult off the mat - but it's such a huge step in the right direction.

I stand by that this tradition sucks for beginners. 
But as I have practiced most days for the last six months, today this practice came easily. I didn't follow Adriene at all.

171,"I remember the first time I did this practice while doing Revolution (can't believe it's been three years! Four even?) and I did not like it at all! I didn't feel like I was at a point where I could just trust my body, knowledge and do what feels good. So stuck in that resistance and clinging to my beloved guide, I mirrored Adriene. 
Now following the Honor calendar, the practice of day 15 titled ""Revolution Day 27 - Self Practice"" reminded me of this one. I was dreading it, to say the least and was pleasantly surprised to discover it was indeed guided. 
Come today, Adriene says ""it's all about celebrating, showing up for yourself"", I feel proud of myself for showing up. Then she says she'll be taking the mic off, I realize this is the once dreaded practice, but this time there is a level of calmness, that trust Adriene keeps talking about. I let go of the resistance, soften my gaze and tap into my inner teacher. 
Managed to stay tapped in for 15 minutes after which I checked the video thinking ""oh I did so much! FOR SURE it's been more than half an hour!"" It hadn't been. Kept going regardless.

Not sure where I'm headed with this but I guess as Adriene always reminds us: honour yourself and listen to what you need without judgement and regardless of any thoughts on where you think you should be. If it is a guide you need, give yourself that, if you feel like turning inwards do that.

I'm thankful that I made it through, despite all the stops and starts and COVID-19 and stress and breaking up with my boyfriend and life.  I could do almost all the poses, some with assistance, except for that damned Crow! Still way beyond my reach, but one day I'll get there!

202,"Did anyone else start to cry when they heard the music at the end....realizing all you have learned....all the truth and love you have spoken for yourself the last 31 days....the small moments of awareness and sensation....the care...the strength that was built.... I'm in awe. When I started yoga in 2011 the only thing I could find on youtube to follow was yoga zone.... which was okay. It was a great introduction but there wasn't a lot of space for someone just starting to learn how to tap into the subtleness of yoga. Since then I got lost in a long journey of weight loss, I tried so many things....lost a lot of weight and gained a lot of it back.... and I have spent a lot of time wondering what I was doing wrong. I was mad at myself....and then starting slow morning classes I was picking out introduced me to YWA .....and I started to learn to trust myself again and something about trusting myself I followed the urge to take this class to tap back into Yoga and care... not about weight loss and something changed. This whole revolution class taught me patience, presence, love, showing up where you are, loving yourself and trusting yourself to go only far enough. Fiding that inner core strength that holds you up and makes you feel secure that has nothing to do with getting TIGHT and shredded. I'm overcome with so much gratitude and love for Adriene and these courses.... holy crap <3 Breathing lots of love in and breathing lots of love out!

I've done some other series before like, ""Dedicate"" or ""Home"",  and they've always been so inspiring and empowering so I thought it was a good time to tackle another one. I suffer from some psychological issues that make me feel  often unstable and Yoga with Adriene is almost the only thing that helps me to stay focused and away from some recurrent bad habits. 
Although I had kind of a hard breakdown that kept me off the mat for 8 days on a row, I came back stronger and got it done, so I'm very happy. Yoga is the best therapy I've tried and Adriene the most peaceful, and encouraging person I've ""met"". I thank a lot  the internet for giving me the possibility to access to such an amazing experience. 
I encourage everyone having a bad time or suffering from mental issues to try yoga. The results are awesome and they actually bring hope. Thanks so much. Looking forward to the next journey!! üíôüíôüíôüíúüíôüíôüíô",Ugyic03Lv_AY5a7L9YZ4AaABAg,0,0,2020-10-23T14:48:23Z,0.9995964169502258

232,"My last day AHHHH so much going on inside me! omg why does this feel emotional. I cried at the end with so much emotions and feeling. It expressed so much about myself and what yoga means to me. The more I connect to my breath the more I hear myself clearly and more subtle with peace. This journey has awakened all the demons inside me and rooted me back to my true self. All the suppressed emotions, feelings and ""disowning of myself"" have been acknowledged and accepted now, more conscious and stronger it allowed me to stay connected and be present. 

Thank you Adriene and to who ever contributed and all the people around the world that are in this journey together. I truly feel the sense of connect and authenticity. I realized that I once abandoned who I am and its time to unleash and be open and honest. So many things yoga taught me and I cannot thank you enough. I wish I could hug you right now. *air hugs

253,"I really truly wish I could join in and say I enjoy the solo ""last day"" videos. This is my 4th consecutive month of a 30-day series, and I always dread the last day. I am not good at remembering poses. Last month I tried to go solo and I ended up doing the same three or four poses over and over. But when I try to follow along, I'm not present, bc my neck is craned to see the video to help me figure out what's next. 34 minutes ends up feeling like an eternity for the first time in the series. I leave feeling tired and downtrodden. I love this channel, it's changed me in so many positive ways, and I'll be doing many many more 30-day journeys.

255,"Today is my third month of yoga with you and these are your words.""Learning to be kind, patient, and gentle with ourselves so that we can be that way with others and with the world"" I am not kind and gentle with myself. ""May all beings be free and happy"" I want to be free of my guilt. At 30, I feel like I've betrayed myself, everything I aspire to be as a person when I was a little girl. Betrayed my convictions. I know I am the only one who can forgive myself but hoping someone, something tells me it's okay. That I am a good person. And yet I know even if this happens, I will still feel guilt as nothing can't be erased. Because even if it's wrong, whatever people say affects us. So people say it's wrong and unforgiveable, it must be true. I am sorry for this self pity message but today I've spent my whole session with you crying on the mat. I know it's the day for us to flow and listen to our body, but I still followed what you did. Funny as when we have to, I just want to stay in child pose. I cried, felt strong and then cried again. I am sorry for every wrong I've done. I wish I could just disappear off this world. I am sorry Adriene and also I am thankful to have found you.

280,"This has been my favourite out of all your 30-day journeys. It was hard but I actually felt the change in my state of mind and in my body day to day. I finished it about a week ago and I'm shocked at how different my abilities are now. I came back to videos that used to be very hard for me and would leave me panting and shaking, and now I breeze through them without even feeling them. 
On that note, I do have a bit of a request, I absolutely want to continue this journey to be more in sync with my body and have a wider range of things I can do with it comfortably. But after doing this series I feel a bit at a loss about what to do next that will actually be challenging. I would love another 30 day challenge or a series of videos that build upon what was done here to continue building muscles but also keeping the mind in a healthy place and the spiritual body coming along for the ride.

284,"Hi Adriene. Having rolled up out of my final shavasna of this challenge and still sitting on my mat, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for this amazing experience. I used your challenge as a way to nurture myself after 10 hour days of providing mental health therapy during this COVID pandemic and I walked away from my mat more grounded and peaceful every single day - even the days where I had to literally drag myself to the mat. Your beauty, kindness and wonderfully wacky sense of humor are beyond compare and made this experience even richer. Today I found that I had worked up to some crazy arse catharsis that I didn‚Äôt see coming and when you turned off your mic and opened up the space I cried through half of my practice. (You‚Äôve turned me into a real sex machine.) Many thanks to you for all that have to (and joyfully) offer.

313,"This has been the second yoga journey I followed (first one was Dedicate).

Let me true to you - in both I didn't like the last practice as much as the others. 
Actually, I liked the last ones the least.
Don't get me wrong, the practices itself were great, as always, and the music was too.

It's just that I'm always looking forward to the last practice.
Not because I'm glad that it's finally over - haha no, it's exactly the opposite.
The last practice is special because I've done all the practices before and this is the last chance to give it my all and enjoy.

Still, I'm kind of frustrated at the end.
All the things I've learned from you through every single practice but I just can't keep up.
I don't know what to do because I miss you telling me what to do.
Maybe I am not ready for practices without you talking to me.
And every time I crunch my neck to see what you're doing I feel like I've missed a lot while not looking.

I always feel intimidated when I followed someone great for a while and then I'm supposed to do it on my own.
I pressurise myself too much, I know.
Would you recommend me to  try again but this time just do what I feel like?
It doesn't have to be similar to what you do at all,  right? 

Anyway, thank you so much for much!
For everything.
I feel like I can be 100% honest with you and with myself.
Hope to meet you some time. 

Namaste and loads of love!",UgxJ9f1j4YOgisZiFN94AaABAg,0,0,2020-06-23T07:24:03Z,0.5613358616828918
314,"Late to the party but just completed this journey. Didn‚Äôt make it in 31 days consecutively but finished it nonetheless. Felt extreme resistance when this video started up and Adriene wasn‚Äôt talking us through! Watched for a few seconds, scrolled through the comments dismayed while searching for others with the same sentiment. Then decided to restart the video and just try. After all we PRACTICE yoga. I wanted to finish the series. Holy lovely, sweaty practice! I must‚Äôve done something right! If you‚Äôre just reading this and wondering the same, return to the video and just do it. You will be glad you did. Take it from me, someone who is not physically fit by any means and has trouble with consistency, along with almost 19 years post-operative spinal fusion from scoliosis (T4-L3) and challenged everyday with anxiety and OCD.

342,Hmmmm combined day 30 and 31. Going from intuition to presence such a journey. I found this journey difficult and sometimes challenging but I found through my journey a couple of new things. It's ok that i cant do crow yet it's a pose that I find extremely hard. Also I have found that my spirit animals are the lioness and the owl. And I use both at certain parts in my practice. I'm actually a mole my traits are a mole hence why I find it hard to fly. Haha just kidding. But yh and to have Benji come and lye right in the middle of the mat was gold haha can't get more present then that. Thanks Adriene and Benji for an amazing journey second time round.

Today I finished day 31 of Yoga Revolution... and I dont know what to say...
I have found your channel here 2 months ago and I started with 30 days of Yoga Home journey.
It has truely changed and shifted me in ways I never expected I would ever reach in my life. 

When I started Revolution I realised how much you have changed, and actually all I see is another me in you.
I see my higherself in you (I hope that doesn't sound creepy) but It cracked me open completely... as I realised and see who you have become now today. 

Ive been sick the majority of my life and now Iam healing...
Healing my wounds, my memories, my feelings, expressions, the fibromyalgia in my body, and with Yoga!
This is the best gift I've given to myself. (thanks to you)
I have cried it all out, all the way, from Home to revolution and back to 0 point being here and now.
I have smiled all the way, felt the purest joy inside of myself and felt my confidence rising each day.
I have never felt so empowered before....

I have no words...
I am home. I found myself... back after a very dark heavy storm.
Now being free, I feel so blessed to be here, and with all my heart I thank you and bow to you and say: Namaste.


For the rest of my life I will keep practicing yoga.
Adriene, Iam so grateful, I will never forget you.

I wish you a wonderful day today and please give Benji a hug from me!

361,"I feel so emotional about this last day... I've been suffering from depression and the last few years have been rough. i've known the revolution almost since it came out but never managed to go to the end of it. This month and because i have lots of free time (yeah quarantine ahah), I thought, why not give it a go again? it's like my fifth attempt to finish it ahaha. and here I am ! I did it.
I feel better in my body. My mind is still a bit troubled but i am still learning how to tame it and how to feel good in this world. It's a long process that requires time ! Thanks for all the love you put into your practices it helps a lot.  I am looking forward continuing to learn yoga with you <3.

Thank you for being the reason I get out of bed every morning with excitement for the day - even if that bright outlook doesn't last all day. I'm so thankful for all that you have taught me. Even though it was a silent practice today, I could still hear all your tips and jokes as I transitioned from one pose to the next. ""Head over heart, heart over pelvis."" The leg baby song. The funny way you say Dandasana. ""Exhale... downward facing dog...""


You have helped me see that I can be more than just a student. That I, too, can be a yogi.

365,"I just started this journey back in 2017. Yoga Revolution was my introduction to yoga practice. However, I didn't finish. 
Recently, I restarted the journey. 
I was about half-way through, but then I needed to have an emergency surgery. I was 6 weeks pregnant when I learned that my pregnancy was ectopic. I lost my precious baby, Cedar.
Recovery from the surgery prevented yoga practice for 2 weeks. When I began yoga practice again, I had to re-familiarize myself with my body--loving and honoring my new body despite my weakened strength and reduced flexibility. I entered the practice with a heavy heart and busy mind as I grieved the loss of Cedar.
And now, I have completed the journey. I was moved to tears when you said you were going to take the mic off, Adriene. I've never practiced yoga without your guidance. 
I practiced things that make me feel powerful and beautiful. I practiced things that make me feel awkward. I practiced resting. I played. I loved myself the whole way through.
Thank you so much, Adriene, for showing up for yourself so that you can show up for us. I feel like I know you. You've been there through the best and the worst of times. Thank you for your wisdom, grace, strength, and inner-beauty.

366,"This has been the first program from Adriene I've done, and I just have to say, THANK YOU ADRIENE. For the longest time I was like ""I'm not gonna check out this Adriene person because everybody keeps saying how great she is and I'm soooo quirky and different so I can't like the stuff everybody else likes"", but once I got here and started this program...  I have felt so grateful for you after so many of these practices. I have found a joy and a playfulness in yoga, in moving my body, in falling, in being interrupted by a furry friend or an unexpected call. I've become the person in my circle of friends telling everyone that they should check out Yoga With Adriene. You've changed the way I view yoga, the way I treat myself and the way I listen to my body. Your direction has given me awareness and control in muscles I have never before thought about, and after this program I feel like I know what yoga instructors mean when they say ""lift here"" or ""ground there"". You have made me laugh at your jokes and at myself many times. You've taught me what it means to ""practice"" without trying to outdo myself or others. You've become my favourite yoga person on the internets. Thank you. I'm gonna come back to your videos soon. Namaste <3",UgzJdgjui2ZJ1dbI3mZ4AaABAg,0,1,2020-04-18T15:25:19Z,0.9996316432952881

I was able to see how hard you work to put this all together and how much it means to you. It truly shows!

A little bit everyday can go a long way. It is disadvantages that we all have that seem to separate us and that is what should bring us together. Sharing our gifts (abilities not disabilities) that should unite us and help us grow together to create a better world. I'm tired of being divided from other people.

I woke up with the same sensation, but I started to see myself doing the asanas in my head and could breathe much better and with a calm mind. Thank you for your help in that stressful moment! I just finished Revolution, and I want to thank you for the accepting, fun way that you teach, inspiring me toward self-compassion and trust.",Ugz2Sq1sOH2MByqOJ0J4AaABAg,0,0,2018-11-03T18:05:30Z,0.9980873465538025

539,Thank you so much Adriene! This marks 91 days of yoga for me since the beginning of August. Yoga has seamlessly made it's way into my daily routine and I appreciate every minute of it each day. I even sometimes squeeze in a little extra practice if I'm feeling frustrated/down and it helps me find perspective and a sense of calm. Next month I'll be working my way through your other videos and perhaps even doing a few practices by myself.... I can't wait!

I saw it as a really cool opportunity to get into a flow and just do whatever my body needed. When I did glance at the video, it was more of a delighted ""Oh hey Girl, me too!"" when I accidentally synced up with you or ""Oh good idea! I'll do that next!"" instead of ""Am I doing it right??""

619,"Oh, Adriene how could I thank you enough? 

I always saw myself as a person who loved life, and who had a propensity for happiness, but somehow, somewhere in the last years I had lost it. 

Showing up everyday on the mat reminded me the importance of standing up for myself, consistently, but calmly. The more I show up, the less I feel like fighting, and the more I get where / what I want, without creating an internal war. I am slowly reaching that ¬´¬†peaceful warrior¬†¬ª state I always wanted to reach. 

I began to do yoga more seriously in February, but that 31 days challenge especially brought me on my way back to happiness, feeling good alone, without needing anyone to share that bliss or to understand where I‚Äôm at. 

That last practice brought me to tears. Some of the best tears of my life. 

Your smile, your confidence, your calmness and your way to assume your silly side resonate so, so much with me. With who I had kind of forgotten I was. I feel more alive now than ever, and even in an uncertain and challenging period of my life, I feel more confident and complete than ever.

Today's practice gave me that feeling. 

And it came so much easier than I thought it would be. I've always wanted to try to complete a session by myself without guidance but I never felt like I had what it took nor the courage to do so. I've been dealing with really unfavourable times lately with depression, and I think I just needed the loving/kind invitation/nudge from someone to really make that step forward, take charge, forget everything else, and do what felt good.

703,"WHEN I came to the mat for the last day of the 31 day yoga revolution, I expecting to be guided through a session where everything we had learnt and experienced would come together on the final day, so I was very surprised to find out I was wrong with the guided session.

Throughout the time this video played, I was thinking of all the different things we had learnt over the journey together and I think I need a refresher class already because there was so much that I didn't include because they were things I had forgotten.

I really loved the choice in the music and I kept me motivated and it was good to use the time to focus on what I had learnt and go through motions within my own time while occasionally looking up at the video and seeing what Adriene was doing.  At times, I would remember doing something but I missed out a step and I couldn't work out what it was and then while looking up, I see that Adriene was doing something similiar to what I was doing.

It was also a good challenge to see if I could do a self guided yoga session, but I will be staying on track with Adriene and not going too far into my own world because I realised I am not focused on what I am doing and I am not focused on my breathe, I am more focused on remember what was to come next.  For me to be at the stage of being self guided, I would need to be able to flow instead of thinking if there was something I am meant to do next and how am I to go from here to there.  My motions don't flow as they should and so today, it was more about thinking and doing with very little time of breathing.

Overall, I really loved the 31 day yoga revolution and I am looking forward to doing the True: 30 Day Yoga Journey.

As for what I will be doing between now and the start date?  I will look at other videos that Adriene has uploaded because I feel as though yoga is one thing I will be committing to each day ...Thank you for the eye opening experience because this time last year, I would have been the last person you could convince to give yoga a try ...",Ugy_U4hzvnJlQZ3oBiF4AaABAg,0,0,2017-12-24T03:12:25Z,0.9668508768081665

As a side note, I was curious to see how the viewing numbers behaved - lots of people watching at the start, and then quite a few dropping out as you progressed; sad but predictable. But this very last Yoga Revolution bucked the trend. I suspect this is for two reasons - Benji stole the show as you went into Cat/Cow... and your commentary-free movement to music is truly beautiful... Beautiful, but difficult to match pose for pose, as you shifted up and down so smoothly.

729,"This was a transformative experience and it took me by surprise. The past year has been specialist after specialist trying to figure out what was wrong with me. I used to love to move, but in February I couldn't even walk without sobbing in pain. After surgery and rehabilitation, I wanted to do this get connected with my body and move again. I did not expect a spiritual journey. 

Today I sobbed out pure joy because I completed 31 days of yoga, pain-free. I feel unbound. I'm not afraid to move anymore.

Thank you Adriene. Sincerely. This has shifted something important inside <3",UgzXFml022fgYQVrrMt4AaABAg,0,0,2017-11-24T22:40:46Z,0.9965292811393738

I guess I learned a lot in the last 31 days. I did not only improve my skills as a ""yogi"" but also learned more about myself. I learned to love my body a little more and how to calm down.

760,"I'm pleased for my myself that I completed a journey I started with Adrienne's videos months ago. This was my least favorite as I know that I sought out yoga teacher instruction that had voice to it so that I could follow along by sound as well as visual. How disappointing to not know from the very beginning, after being invested in a yoga practice for 30 days, that the last video would be unscripted... without voice. A total contrast to all 30 days of instruction. If I knew what to do on my own, I would not be seeking out yoga instruction on YouTube. Hence, my least enjoyable of this series. Sad way to end. I doubt Adrienne will even read my comments... It's the second time I have ever given a review of a YouTube video, but I took the time during the video to sign on to her channel just to put my ""thumbs down"" mark rating of it. Perhaps in a next series she should inform her public at the very beginning that she will not voice the last video so that the public may make an informed choice right from the start whether to follow the series to the end... for a sense of personal achievement andcompletion... or move on to another YouTube video instruction.

763,"I just want to thank you for this wonderful practice.  It was really amazing to me to just have this quiet time with the lovely music to follow where my body and mind wanted to move together.  I felt like this video was an opportunity to just trust myself instead of just the video, and do the poses that resonated the most with me at this time. I felt like I had no time limit, but could put some time into some of the balancing poses that challenge me the most and I really found myself listening better to my breath and flowing with greater patience.  Thank you for that.
Most of all, I found healing and real gratitude when I was stretching my hamstrings in the sitting forward fold and spinal twists.  I had my left leg extended out and was surprised to feel my leg slide out further and actually touch the floor.  It has never, in my 35 years of life, been able to do that (I was born with some back and leg issues).  I have been crying since then, feeling so much love and gratitude for what I've learned and for myself.  This issue has always been something that's held me back from having true self-confidence and real love, because I've let it frustrate me for so long.  I never, ever expected this.

775,"hello my friend! what's up? :) 

I owe you my gratitutes for this has been a great pleasure and self realization of what a body and mind can do. I've somehow stumbled upon your channel and shared the experience so far. that was when I realised my mind and body endure too much burden, perhaps that was also the main cause of my recent neck and belly hernia. the way you invite me to this journey was really spontaneous, and each day has been so affirmative in all aspects...

pain in my body has diminished, I feel the expansion (!? ;) my mind is offered through this journey. this is the space each of us need so bad in our lives; breath and hence the flow led by it are granting us the tools that one needs to dwell in the present.

and this video is very special in that it is ( like all the others) made with compassion! it reminded me the day, the moment in my childhood when I first started to swim:)

781,"Hello A:
Apologies for the long message, however, it is important you know how much of an impact our practice together has had over these past few months. 

My beautiful and beloved wife MaryAnne passed away in May and, in addition to grief, I felt completely lost, purposeless, and detached from the world. 

During her 4 year illness we would practice very-beginners yoga together so as to keep her from tightening up. Toward the end of her illness (stage 4 metastatic breast cancer), I would gently move her into some basic postures so she could stretch. 

Once caregiving responsibilities ended, so too did my reason for getting up and getting out - I isolated and felt only pain. 

Then I decided to do at least one thing every day that might take my mind elsewhere and I found your 30-day yoga program. ""Graduating"" that, I moved to the 31 day revolution and just finished today. 

Since beginning I have slowly begun to relearn the world, started exercising again, eating right, etc. I have cried and grieved on the mat as well as off but I now find it soothing and her presence constant. 

I attribute this growth to you my friend. You opened me up and allowed the light to come in. I am forever grateful. Thank you for all you do and for all that you are. You saved my life.",UgwzWVt7loBuP4ys01p4AaABAg,1,0,2017-10-20T18:43:41Z,0.996026873588562

Yoga with you makes me so happy and it helped immensely with healing my shoulder that got broken in January when I slipped on snow.

791,"Hi all, I've only just finished as I'm a newcomer to the wonders of yoga and our wonderful teacher Adriene! I wanted to say what a powerful finish to a wonderful revolution this was, an invitation to be present and to go where the yoga flow took you. Over the course of the revolution I became slightly more flexible, (I can get that leg up from plank to lunge now!) and I really look forward to the feeling of coming onto the mat and connecting with my inner self. My dog grabs his toy or his bed and drags it to the end of my mat and chews on it, contributing and participating in the good vibes and feels my yoga practice brings to us. One of the unexpected benefits I've discovered is that I find myself involuntarily taking really deep cleansing breaths when I'm going about my day, I think my body has found that this feels really good and takes it upon itself to do it when I need it.

It's really hard for me, but I'm trying to do my best. And that's beautiful. I think that's really beautiful, 'cause on friday will be 3 months since I've started doing yoga. Awesome.

I typically go for a run for my workout but after recently giving birth to a surrogate 2 1/2 months prior to finding your videos I was ready to try something new. Something for myself. I started your 31 day revolution 31 days ago. I must say, your yoga revolution has taken me on a much further journey than any run has. I too began tonight's yoga crying. Crying because of the journey with myself, my accomplishment, my dedication to putting my all into each session and the fact that I really tried to just be in the moment for myself. I thank you for sharing your gift of yoga, life and compassion with all of us. As I continue with your yoga I look forward to another revolution.

To make it here, day 31, means so very much to me, committing to this practice every day no matter what life threw at me has given me condifence in myself and taught me a discipline that I have always strived for. Discipline was one of my main reasons for starting this journey, as I feel like my whole life I have had the passion to start many things but lacked the discipline to follow them through to fruition, but with this I changed that pattern and it has made me feel like I can truly go after my dreams. Thank you for creating such a joyful and supportive journey for all of us, and thank you to everyone else on here for making me feel like I'm part of a community, it's been amazing to read your comments and know that other people understand how much this program has meant to me and what the journey has been like :) While I am so very grateful, proud, and overjoyed to be here today it is bittersweet because reaching the end of this program feels like saying goodbye to a dear friend, as Ana Montoya commented below, this was so much more than just a workout program, and I gained so much more mentally, spiritually, and emotionally than I had ever expected.

852,"i started this journey about 7 month late just because i was looking for something to get back into exercising with. after watching several other yoga videos I finally found these and they where the first that didn't annoy me such much that i wanted to turn them off.
so i started this journey thinking i can never do that show up every day and push trough for 31 days. now I'm laying here after this last practice, granted it took me 36 days since I had to take a few days off due to traveling etc.
but right now i thought back to what i was thinking when i clicked on the first video; i was thinking oh i can never do this either my back/shoulders are gonna give up due to the problems I have there or my knee (which I had surgery on 2 years ago when i was 17) is gonna give up and hurt. But these videos gave me a chance to do everything at my own pase and in my own style they didn't make me focus on getting the shape perfect etc.
the first week i hated down dog and planks with a passion even hovering my knees over the ground from tabletop seemed impossible and had me quite frustrated and close to crying cause I couldn't do it.
looking back on today I admit i was quite frustrated in the beginning since i really enjoy having clear instructions but after a while i got into the flow of the music and what my body wanted and needed. it's quite funny for me to see that these figures I hated so much in the beginning are the once i torn back to for comfort today.
I'm truly thank full for this video series and the mails that came with it. something that will probably always stay in my head is the sentence: ""everything is as it should be""
i find the thought if it quite comforting.

853,"I come at a much later date but I thought I'd share my experience.  Throughout Adriene's videos I often rely on the verbal cues.  I couldn't do that with this episode.  I found I was getting frustrated.  I couldn't get the full effect of the stretches because I was constantly looking up at the video to see what was next.  During the cool down I realized that is my block.  I don't listen to my body the way I should.  Then as if on cue, just like Adriene's dog, my dog came over to the mat today for the first time since I've been practicing.  Her face hovered right over mine as if to say ""it's ok.""

This day in particular made me feel confident that I can create my own practice, which, again, I never thought would be possible for me.

This 31 days of revolution have changed me ‚Äì a lot. It has changed my way I see the world, the way I see the practice, and it has made me realise that I'm capable of doing things I thought I wasn't capable of.

I missed workouts at the gym but never missed a single day of yoga with you. I thought that after 61 days I would be doing the splits and have this amazing flexibility (I still struggle with the splits and my flexibility has improved dramatically), but what I have gained is more than just physical strength and endurance...I've gained mental fortitude, grit, and toughness. It did not occur to me until I stepped onto the mat with you every day how much i actually NEEDED yoga. I made every excuse to not do it but every time i started, I was glad I did. 

During these 61 days you've helped me through my anxiety and helped me cope through the sadness of the passing of a very dear friend. 

As a school teacher, I have always loved to learn. You have taught me patience within myself and a way to self care. I cannot wait to adapt your teachings into my own practice. Thank you for planting the seed of yoga in my life.

924,"Words seem so limiting when it comes to expressing how soulful, life-changing, profound and meaningful this practice has been. Anon Amos summed it up perfectly. I was completely unprepared for this sort of lesson, after so many days of waiting for instruction, watching carefully in case I ""got it wrong"", despite being told so many times that there is no real 'wrong' and that it was about finding what felt good on a personal level. Finding our own way is what it's truly all about and watching this practice completely reinforces that. I surprised myself with the confidence of my own flow, the positions I could move into without prompt, the trust in my own ability. Adriene, you are such a shining star and ray of light in this crazy world.

But there's something about the way you teach, Adriene. It's truly special, and I have yet to see anything like it. I began my yoga journey about 9 months ago with pretty much no expectations. I tried a few different people's videos, but none of them compare to yours. You have such a wonderful energy and perspective.

This practice was so fitting, and I started crying at the end because I plan to quit my awful job today. Having the freedom to find what feels good on the mat has given me the courage to do so off the mat. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Adriene.

Until a year and a half ago I was too good for yoga -  I thought it was about holding still and I thought that was a dumb way to exercise. So wrong!  As my body's tightened up from kayaking too much, yoga has loosened it up, given me tools to be able to continue doing what I love off the mat. It's given me more than arms that don't fall asleep and a body that feels strong and good though - it gives me mental space to acknowledge feelings as they come, and to move on.  You've helped bring me out of struggles with acceptance of what my life is and is not as a single not-mom, a hard break up, and a solo cross country move.  Thank you.  We did it together.

I love waking up to every new lesson focus you set for exploration, which is fantastic for my experience of depression. I love the growth and focus I've been gifted, as well as my sexy calfs!

1011,"This is my story. I attended yoga class in gym before and I hated it. The movements were so repetitive and I came from pilates based workout so I was used to fast paced core crushing movements but yoga had been my must try resolution for the past three years, I gave myself a chance. Also, flexibility challenge in March showed me how stiff I was and I was quite unhappy with myself. Last month, I completed 27 days of yoga camp where I did skip several days and played catch up on certain days. I had to stop to rest my foot. This month I decided to try revolution and I stuck by it every day. I started last time with a restless heart and impatience, now I'm looking forward for these sessions each morning. Just to accommodate yoga because I usually do hiit or pilates in the evening and I had not much time to squeeze it all, I gave my sleep to yoga before work. I would never imagine waking up to work out, let alone yoga but I did and I'm amazed by my willingness. This experience has truly humbled me and it takes a great teacher to make me enjoy this journey. I love the breathing exercises, I love feeling light and floaty and I will hold on to these good feelings as I proceed forward. This experience has also made me connect with my inner self, my love for expressions and emotions. Thank you Adrienne.",UgjiM60KXoq0hXgCoAEC,0,0,2017-05-31T10:51:35Z,0.9983503818511963

When I started this journey I had several not so healthy behaviors with my diet and exercise, with my relationship to my body. I feel like through this my whole world view has changed, I'm seeing myself and others differently. And, I just loved this last video. I was scared before and a little bit during it (what if I finish too early? too late? forget to do both sides evenly?) but then when I was able to be present it was just amazing. I never thought anyone but trained yoga teachers could ""do yoga"" without instructions. But I was wrong, about what a yoga teacher is and what ""doing"" yoga is. But I'm learning, because of you.

1063,"Right I have to share my story because this was so bloody hard for me to do. Im a person who get very easily frustrated...by most things really (so I need some yoga in my life!), but especially if I feel there's something I can't do, and if I have very little guidance, then I get super stressed.... So....

Adriene: I'm going to take my mic off..
Me: No, no no no, I need you woman!
Music starts: Ok uhm, fine let's do this. She's trying to challenge me, make me find my inner teacher or whatever. Ok let's do this. Uhm... all fours, downward dog... eeeeh what else is there. What is she doing? Ok, that. Fuck it I've already done that. eh eh, uhm uhm. 

So this goes on for about half the vid, and it started out well, tried to find my calm with the music but as I have 0 memory whatsoever, tabletop and downward dog becomes a little boring, so I try following along what she's doing but it's hard without the guidance. And by now I'm really frustrated and I'm trying to think 'way to be alive! way to be human! you're enough' and all that but what I really wanna do is scream 'you worthless piece of shit video, I hate myself! I'm so bad at this!'

So I get frozen on all fours and starts crying in frustration. But I managed to continue and tried to follow along because doing it by myself won't work when I can't remember shit. 

I wanted this to have a good end but it doesn't... I just started crying again at the end. 
I have a lot to work with... At least the video reminded  me of that...",Ughf2lHfS7rtvXgCoAEC,0,0,2017-05-09T06:19:18Z,-0.9989296793937683

I started this session with the biggest smile and I thought of all the times I came to me to sit down with me and I cried. I sat and I laughed and I cried and I moved into cat cow and saw that you were doing it at the exact same time. And I thought of all the times I have done cat cow and how good it felt everytime and how it made my life a more joyous one and I laughed even harder and smiled so big. I loved to just hear the music and let my intuition tell me what to do next and I thought of how this journey helped me to become the best friend of my body. 
How much luck and happiness you can experience by just being in a loving relationship with ones body and how much easier it is then to become the friend of our mind. 
I need to thank you because it is just so beautiful. Thank you so much, and I send you all of the love I am feeling right now because it is just so beautiful.

This program has greatly reduced my stress level and made me excited to continue with yoga, so I was deeply saddened to have this experience on the last day. I understand the goal in eliminating the microphone and speech cues, but maybe next time somehow have two versions of the video: one with speech, one without. I greatly admire those in this comment section who were able to complete this video happily and without stress, but for those of us who aren't quite there yet, I wish there had been another outcome.

1132,"I was introduced to yoga nearly 3 years ago, at the age of 36, by my best friend, my little sister. At that point, I had been through 7+ years of spinal surgeries and procedures, was taking a dangerously high dosage of both narcotic and non-narcotic pain medications, and was overweight and unhealthy. She knew I had recently discovered Buddhism and Vipassana meditation, and was attempting to live a healthier life, and she sent me a link for a Yin session from Ekhart Yoga, and a link to Yoga with Adriene. And, the rest is history!
I homeschool our two teens, and I quickly made meditation and Yoga with Adriene part of our daily routine...actually, it's how we begin each and every day.
I made some progress over that first year or two...lost about 30 pounds and began to eat a healthier diet, but I kind of fell in and out of this new lifestyle and never really met my goals.
Last year, I visited a physician because I had developed gynecomastia due to long term opioid use. By that time I had been clean from narcotic pain meds for about a year. I had to have a double mastectomy, which revealed the precursors to breast cancer. This surgery and recovery was very difficult, and I made the decision that once I had fully recovered I would get on the right path and finally meet my goals, and my life has never been the same!
I stopped taking all medications, prescription and OTC...I manage my chronic pain through meditation and yoga. I spend about 45-60 minutes total each day in meditation...I practice Yoga with Adriene every morning, and I do a 45-90 minute Yin session every other night. I have a daily cardio workout routine and an every other day kettlebell workout routine. I also eat a very strict ketogenic diet, and follow a time restricted diet. I fast for 24 hours about every 4 days, and I complete a 7-day water fast every 3-4 months...I actually just finished one that coincided with the final week of Yoga Revolution. I've lost an addition 40+ pounds over the past several weeks...down to 172 from 240 about a year ago!
The bottom line is, yoga saved my life! It is the one thing that has helped me most in regards to my severe spinal injury, and in regards to pain management. It has provided me with confidence and peace. It is a beautiful thing, and I thank you Adriene for doing what you do!!! 
I just completed day 31 of Yoga Revolution, and having just finished a 7-day fast, and taking into account all of the goals I have accomplished over the last month, it was the most spiritually uplifting and emotional yoga session I have ever experienced! AND...AND! I was able to hold the crow pose for the first time EVER!!! lol

1166,"Oh my. Adriene,

Thank you so much for this journey. This has been such an eye opener and spirit cleanser. 
When I first started out, I didn't think I would be able to make this commitment. 
I made it! I grew physically and emotionally. I've never connected more to myself than I did during the past month. 
I'm not perfect and some days I didn't get on the mat, but that's okay. 
We are human. We are beautiful. 
Thank you for your encouraging words that lifted my spirits. 

Namaste

I am grateful. Very grateful. I've changed so much. In the last 3 months too, because I got myself to love and I started  to appriciate myself so I could lost over 10 kilos. 
I'll be honest: I cheated twice on this journey, because once I just didn't have time for my yoga, and once my brother got home finally after a week and I chose to spend time with him, so I skipped it, BUT (!!) on the next day I made the practice of the previous day each time. I love you so much Adriene. I was curious, what the last day would be, I knew it would be special, but this... I can't find the words. Whole day I felt so special, blessed, happy and this.... Throughout this practice I was being only me, with the gentle music, with your guide, with the peace and the silence, and I love you. With the movements I felt like I am telling a story.

Your lessons on self love are so powerful and can transform the way you look at yourself, others, and life as a whole. Thank you.Now for the constructive criticism, I have really enjoyed this revolution series, however I was slightly bummed with the very last video only because I wanted to practice full presence but found myself focusing on trying to keep up with you since you removed your mic. Personally, I loved that you removed your mic, as it allowed you to be completely present¬†in your practice but I would have liked maybe a voiceover of basic instruction (now go to downward facing dog.. right leg up, knee to nose etc.) just so that I could have also¬†been fully present with the sensations and not¬†as focused on looking up at the screen to see if or what I have missed.Again, overall you do an amazing job at teaching this practice. You were made to do this, that is for sure.

On the very first days I felt a little bit annoyed as you spoke way too much (sorry T.T'). And not until today did I realise how much I miss your voice, your laugh along the practice. I was kinda sad today when you didn't say anything at all.

1222,"I started Yoga Revolution 31 days ago on a bit of a whim.  In the past, I've had times where I've done nearly daily practices, but it was in the old days - prior to YouTube - and I had a video or two I'd do.  The same one or two every day.  I eventually got tired of them and never really got into doing unguided practice.  I'd stretch pretty much daily and incorporate yoga poses, but it isn't the same as doing a real practice where you're moving meaningfully and with breath.  Prior to starting Yoga Revolution, I'd also done a few individual Yoga with Adriene videos.  So, I wasn't a yoga novice, but I also hadn't been making yoga any sort of priority recently.

31 days ago, though, I thought ""What the heck - I'm going to commit to doing yoga for 31 days no matter what,"" and I did.  Through a cold, on busy days when it seemed near impossible to fit in practice, I kept showing up.  Adriane, you pretty much rock.  I love your style of playfulness and your instructive method.  I love that the practices build on each other, have a rhythm and have brought something new each day.  All of this made it so much easier to show up every day.

After about a week, I started telling people about it.  ""I'm doing this Yoga 31 Day Revolution thing.  It's great.  You should check it out.""  I know at least two people who have now also started.  

I showed up today, excited but also a little sad about the end.  I've been thinking about what I want to do next because I really want to keep doing a daily practice.  Maybe I'll do Yoga Camp.  Maybe I'll do 30 Days of Yoga.  Maybe I'll restart the Revolution.  Maybe I'll do some individual videos for a few days, then start one of the above.  I haven't decided yet.  And that's not really the same as knowing for sure there is a plan for tomorrow.  So, accomplishment is mixed with a little bit of sadness and a little bit of excitement to figure out the next step.

I had no idea today would be what it was.  I was expecting (as others have also expressed), a regular voice guided practice.  What I got instead was a final exam of sorts.  For me, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I've always been the sort of nerdy student who likes to show off what I know.  I started off a little bit stressed (what if I get behind?), but found that my body knew what to do.  I rarely looked at the screen, but when I was flowing along and looked, it felt like a side by side practice with a friend.  When I felt like I wasn't sure what I wanted to do next, it was a sometimes a source of inspiration or sometimes reassurance (yup - did that) mixed with, ""Hmm, now I have to figure out what to do next for myself.""  It was a combination of, ""Look how much I've learned!"" and ""I still feel supported.""  At times it was great, at times a little scary.  (Funny to say about doing yoga in my own home!)

So, to sum up, thank you, Adriene, for this channel in general and for creating Revolution specifically.  It's been a great 31 days of increased flexibility, strength and relaxation.",Ugic4p1I7N2ZVngCoAEC,0,0,2017-03-18T19:51:05Z,-0.1423012558483262

My victory is in coming to the practice when I can, and repeatedly returning to the mat after several days' absence amidst lots of shaming brain chatter; Trusting myself to complete a goal in my own way and time and empowering myself to cut out that which doesn't serve me(I unsubscribed from the daily emails because I felt ashamed of getting ""behind"" and instead enjoyed seeing the activity tally on my fitness app go steadily up).

1246,"Dear Adriene, 

First of all things - I thank you, from my heart, for spreading all this love into the world. I am so grateful for your gift. 

Joining you in this journey helped me discover that I am so much stronger than I thought. I discovered that finding ease while doing difficult things with my body is something I am very much able to do. ""Acting from a place of connect"" , finding and going with the flow - is what I enjoy the most, life feels most meaningful when this happens. Although I strive to live by this principle for many years, you now helped me gain a structure and discipline for really applying this, on another level. 

In day 14 I was already able to maintain Crow pose for 5 sturdy seconds. By the end of this program, my spine was straight, so straight, I think it was never like this before.
I was absolutely amazed to discover this about myself, like a hidden jewel, like a myth that now was proven to be true. I am capable of so many great things, even capable of finding silence within, feeling satisfaction for just being myself.  

Truly, this was a revolution. A re-descovery, a re-invention. 

I will continue to learn from you, kind and precious soul. 

Sending some love back to ya.

Absolutely amazing journey, thank you so much, Adriene. You have really opened up the world of Yoga for me. I've progressed in body, mind and spirit more than I imagined after 31 days. From a simple thing like having my heels touch the ground in downward dog, to today having a very present, conscious, and lengthy crow. From struggling to find time for myself and showing up on the mat, to understanding that when I give myself time and space to practice - everything else flows so much more smoothly. From trying to force myself to conquer the poses, to accepting myself how I am in the present. 

The light in me, bows to the light in you.
The teacher in me, acknowledges the teacher in you.
The yogi in me, thanks the yogi(ni) in you.

1350,"I've practiced yoga for quite a few years. Public classes on and off. But I've never done something like this where I show up every day for 31 days. 

I'm a mom of 4 with lower back pain (from said children) and finally realized that what felt good to my body pre-children (running) no longer served me. 

So I showed up here. Some days were hard, some days were ""easy"", but every day I was thankful that I showed up for myself. Not only did it improve my form, help my back, & give me overall strength, but it put me into the practice of carving out time for self care every single day and helped me find focus and peace. Even while on my floor amongst crushed up cheerios. 

Some days it felt like Adrienne was saying exactly what I needed to hear. I'm so thankful I found this. Now I just don't know what to do next!",UgiyrM5VCEcicHgCoAEC,0,0,2017-02-28T04:18:46Z,0.9985833168029785

1417,"I wanted to write you a message. This yoga revolution has changed my life. I am currently recovering from anorexia, I felt like I was lost as I've had to stop the gym due to orthorexia too and my body was being neglected. Transitioning through this journey my mental state has changed so much. It's taught me start learning and listen to my body. How it feels and how important it is to just BREATHE. You give a message of how amazing our bodies are and how we have the power to choose how we look after them. It's also given me some strength too and whilst I can't go to the gym, yoga is go to to every day and I can now say it always will be because I notice how much it helps my day! So thankyou so much for this, I shall be following you for the foreseeable future without a doubt. Lots of love from the UK :) xxxxx",UgieZox4qDnOmHgCoAEC,0,0,2017-02-19T18:30:30Z,0.9991216063499451

1419,"I tried Yoga in classes several times. But I always got frustrated - thinking, I'm ""not flexible by nature"", which made me quite sad, because I'm really into meditation and mindfullness and interested in ""spiritual stuff"".
So I gave myself one last chance and joined the challenge. It was rough at the beginning, but I kept going and there were times when I was so proud of myself as I saw myself getting more and more flexible. Since January I'm doing your courses and through them, I feel like I really found a side of myself that was hidden a long time.

my dog Buddy loved to settle down nearby....occasionally nose his way in with a doggie hug or some kisses.
Suddenly ...buddy had a stroke.  right there before my eyes....beside my yoga mat. 
 I had to take him into the vet and say goodbye
After that....whenever I thought about getting out my yoga mat....I couldn't do it.
Finally...
I got out the mat and followed along on this 31 day journey.
I needed it so much more than I knew

1424,"I started the journey on january the first and finished it today, february the 19th. In total I practiced yoga 32/50 days so I'm still proud of myself. (I freestyled a couple of days + I did some videos in a row) For a 10 day period in january I only practiced yoga one time, as I was stressed with my exams and didn't feel like doing yoga - but I got back on track after that and I've pretty much practiced yoga 5 times per week on avarage (sometimes weeks 6x, one week 4x, and a 10 day ""break"" in january) I will definely follow other yoga videos and continue my regular practice. Yoga is so relaxing and I can tell my anxiety has gotten so much better. I couldn't be more thankful. <3",UghKTV_V7kOJ03gCoAEC,0,0,2017-02-19T12:27:31Z,0.994242250919342

1436,"Dear Adriene, this Revolution has changed me completely. Spiritually and physically. I can't believe how these short and (most of the time) sweet practices has been able to strengthen my inner muscles as much as they have - I had to stop in the middle of this last sequence just to call out to myself that I CAN DO THIS - and I have been practicing for over ten years! 

The mantras and the vocabulary that you have been chanting has been SO important and it would be stupid to stop now. I am never giving up my daily yoga routine after this; not only does it strengthen and tone me, it creates a calm, an inner balance and an understanding of the bodily features. Not just the outer but the ones you can not see but only feel. 

I could go on for hours but I will spare you this time. Thank you so much for sharing this with us. From the bottom of my heart to yours,

Jai namaste <3 See you on the mat.

I have to admit, I found it very difficult to stay ""present"" with no audio cues. Of course nothing today was new, we've been building up to this all month (or 6 weeks in my case), but I guess I just need a little something to keep me in the flow. I found myself constantly looking at the screen, ""where are we now? what am i supposed to be doing now?"" even though I know that is TOTALLY NOT THE POINT,  but I started going down a failure spiral and I almost shut the laptop and quit.

I was so into my own lil druggy world that i forget what life had in store for me. Must have been in December of 2016, when everything came crashing down, after months and months of trying to stop my drug abuse i did, it was hard honestly. I would cry to the universe to give me the strength to stop, not also that but not to mention that same month my ex left me, gave up on me, even though i was finally telling the truth this time. May i also mention i got fired from my job, and also my dad passed away all this happened in one month. Idk honestly how i came across ""Yoga with adriene"". Yoga has changed my life 360. i just wanted to say if your struggling in your life honestly, YOGA is the way to go. I was so dependent on my ex to help me out but the more i did yoga the more i realized that i never needed him. same with my job, i didn't need that job,manager was not the nicest lady, and never gave me the chance to move up in the company. My drug dependency was getting under control, but i had no support from anyone. YOGA taught me to find that fire, that lion in me, that strength that courage. I had forgotten how much i loved dancing i forgot what made me, ME, Yoga truly is a wonderful most beautiful thing we as human can take.

You inspired me to try a new yoga routine aka yoga revolution ‚ú®

When I started this yoga 31 day yoga practice I didn't really understand how to move from a place of connect, or how to meditate properly although I've tried many things similar to it.

Your fun, loving attitude really stuck with me and made it extremely easy and comforting to ""show up on the matt"" every day.

I've suggested you to countless friends, 
You have a great energy, an old soul if there ever was one. 

I would go on and on about how this practice has played an important role in my life destiny, but I figure I'll just live it out instead.

1613,"I didn't want to miss any of the days in this revolution. When I started, i knew it would be a challenge to find time for myself, but I did. I carved out the time for right after I woke up and before I took a shower each morning. And I stuck with it. I missed Day 30 and I felt bad because I didn't show up for myself, but as I went through day 31 and did the practice by myself, it made me realize that I need to just acknowledge where I am. I am going to turn 16 in a matter of days and the past few weeks I've been freaking out because now I only have two more years to get through before I'm an adult. Before I'm on my own. And there are still so many levels I haven't hit yet. I'm 15 and still watch cartoons like Phineas and Ferb or the Winx Club. I still freak out every time there's a new Disney movie. I eat Fruit Loops every day. What kind of adult am I growing up to be???

But today, This practice, I got my aha moment. I have NO IDEA who I'm going to be. The best thing I can do is acknowledge where I am in my journey and acknowledge where I want to be by the end of 2017. And that's the best feeling. The pressure of trying to meet everyone's expectations. I felt like I was free. I could cry right now. And I kind of want to. Being my own teacher was slightly scary because I'm used to being taught. I actually kind of like being taught. Being told what to do. And that may also be why learning to drive is a little rough for me. But I'm learning. And that's the best feeling in the world. Learning. As you get older, learning doesn't seem as fun as it was in the beginning. But I'm going to rediscover how much fun it can be to learn. Hope you all enjoyed the Revolution as much as I did.

When I started Yoga Revolution  I knew I was gonna complete it because I don't like to leave something undone. What I didn't know is that I will  want to pratcice yoga everyday - forever!

It changed me sooo much! My mind and body are stronger and for the first time I don't fell Winter blues. I still have to work hard on my self-respect and self-love and that crow pose ;).

This last day e-mail and the last day pratcice made me very emotional, kind of sad and happy and excited - all at once. And the comments really made me cry because they say everything I mean but can't put into words.

The journey continues... 

Thank you, Adriene, for inviting me to make a change, to make a revolution in my life. Thanks for guidance. I love your voice <3.

I am on day 15 and loving it ( I use to practice awhile ago but needed to have yoga back in my life!) and I have a pretty bad neck I noticed some postures it hurts later so I am wondering if you have any tips on how to modify poses for those of us with bulging discs and degenerative disc in our necks? The problem for me is I don't feel pain when doing the poses its after so do you have any insight¬† for me on this?

1681,"I told myself that if I could devote a half hour of my day for 30 days in a row to this practice, then I could do anything to better my life. A month ago I wouldn't have believed that a workout could leave me sobbing from its beauty and joy and deep, deep connection. But here I am. This revolution has truly changed how I see the world and, most importantly, how I value myself.

My body has changed, too. I let myself hold plank today for as long as I could, and I felt strength, ease, and presence, even through the shaking. Today was also the first time in the 31 days that I touched my toes in a forward fold.

I read the comments on these videos each time that I finish and think how lucky I am to be even on the outskirts of this community. I am proud of all of our journeys, and I am so deeply grateful for Adriene.

1686,Thank you so much Adriene.  What an amazing unexpected experience.  We have both enjoyed yoga with all of you and have been so surprised by the changes we have felt - physically and emotionally.  I started the 31 days with a problematic back and now have so much more flexibility and improved mindset around the injury that I am determined to keep up my yoga practice.  We have both surprised ourselves with what we actually could do - way beyond my expectations and just showed how much I was living in fear and limitation.

No words can express what the Yoga Revolution 'did to me' :) 
On all levels. In all bodies. 
I did not expect this at all...
I'm a bad 'self-caretaker' and I have always been.
I have been on a long journey working on my best version everyday.
But something was missing.
Untill your amazing practice came to my life.
The day 31 was very special. Honestly, half of the practice, I cried...I think it was something like tears of kindness and peace :)
For the first time in my entire life, I kept the commitment to practice and do 'what feels good for me' :) And it has not hurt at all! No need to talk myself to everyday practice. Pure joy. And impatient waiting for your email everyday to get on mat :) 
You are doing amazing job for many people.
Thank you for hitting the right and true terms for life. All is created in such a harmony.
And yes :) I keep going. 
You have my deep respect and admiration.
Wishing you all the best!

Because it has taken an enormous commitment ans strength of will to show up on the mat every single day for the last month with three little kids who demand so much time, and to be free of alcohol since 2 weeks before that. And I did it. I have had tonsillitis the past few days but I still showed up and moved as I could. I cried because I made it and Adriene, I clung to these beautiful videos to do it. All the feels, truly. 

I am going to practise yoga every day for the next month too, and then the month after that.

You are my happy thought when my alarm goes off at 5am. When I get to my mat, everything is fabulous and you are the incentive to get there!

I can't wait to see what you do next! 

I would LOVE to see 31 days of 15 minute comprehensive and intense flow routines. This might allow me to have my deep yoga flow and sleep 15 minutes longer, too! Or have a quick power yoga break in the middle of an intense day of work. Thank you for sharing your yoga journey and beautiful personality with us! You are wonderful!

I've done two ""transformative"" programs before, out of which only one I could follow consistently. That program actually gave my muscles amazing definition, and most days after the practice I felt good, but finding the motivation to begin the practice was tough. This yoga revolution, however, is a miracle in that I look forward to showing up to the mat! It's actually the highlight of my days! No other practice has had that effect before. I feel good before and after practice. It has been so therapeutic in so many aspects of my life. Thank you, Adriene!
Also, around week 3, I started questioning what I was gonna do with my life once this revolution ended. A few days ago, I stopped. I knew. I was going to continue practicing yoga. Every day. No more pressure about what a yoga session should be, just listen to my body and challenge myself every once in a while. Simple.

This daily checkin fast became my therapy. Wild, uncensored and raw emotions rose up within me almost on a daily basis during the practices. One time, in the stillness practice, I actually yelled out, ""Damn you, Adriene!"". Haha! Sorry, I didn't mean it. It was more just DAMN in general as all sorts of really deep and hard stuff came to the surface. Other times I was laughing giddily, and other times I cried. These 31 days were intensely profound on all levels. I've also entered into a much gentler and loving relationship with myself. I am being so much kinder to myself and to others. I looked at my naked self in the mirror the other day and instead of being critical I actually started laughing and I exclaimed, ""I LIKE YOU!"". My heart has expanding. P.S. I also feel way stronger physically and my chronic upper back tension has pretty much disappeared. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, dear Adriene. Big hugs!

1919,"I've been doing yoga off and on for several years but Yoga with Adriene for only a couple years now, and I remember beginning with the 30 Days of Yoga. What I remember most was on day 30 when ""finding what feels good"" hit me for the first time. Those 1st 29 days I followed the videos like I was looking at a mirror, and all of a sudden I realized I didn't have to. 
I cried because it really never ever even occurred to me that I was capable of flying solo in my yoga practice. Capable of listening to what my body needed, and then adjusting accordingly. 
Now I find myself constantly wandering off the trail of the videos and finding my way back, or adjusting little things like staying in a ""forward bow"" instead of adding a ""half way lift"". I use the videos now more as a guide, but I allow myself to stray if thats what I need that day. Things I never would've considered before!

You've been in my life for almost three months now ‚Äì I stumbled upon one of your videos when I was looking for some sort of relaxation and a way to build myself up, mostly because bullies at my workplace had been making my days very difficult and I was starting to feel it taking its toll physically. I have been practicing yoga every day with you since then, and it's really made a world of difference. I feel a lot less anxiety overall, my knee injury isn't holding me back from doing all this freaky stuff on the mat anymore, I am more grounded within myself and am growing aware of how powerful both my mind and my body, but most importantly the connection between the two, really are.

This revolution series especially has released a lot of surprising things (I finally quit my job for example ‚Äì and yes, I blame you ;)) that obviously needed to get out. Like a long overdue spring cleaning, but way more fun!

2084,Oh Adriene! I felt so much pure joy that I was completely blanketed in it by the end of the practice! I genuinely haven't felt this good or connected in such a long time that I am overwhelmed in the best possible way. I challenged myself to poses that I don't usually automatically go for and sequences that lit such a beautiful fire in my body and my heart. I managed balance postures with more integrity and stillness (without clenching or holding) than I think I have ever have. I took rests to cool it back down and I completely tuned into my breath and used it to centre and guide me. So many beautiful things happened to me during this practice that I haven't felt before when doing a self guided practice. Yes!,UgiUSbScTl7liHgCoAEC,0,0,2017-01-31T18:57:36Z,0.9995664954185486

for 2017. One of these challenges was to start practicing yoga every day for ¬†minimum 30 minutes. So, I decided to start searching on youtube for yoga practice. I found you, Adriene and I saw your project for 31 days of yoga revolution and my intuition told me ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! You have to try!‚Äù. After this I started to practice everyday and that was my way to
see my progress. I printed your calendar and started to record every day with different colors. Today was my last practice with your project and I feel more flexible, more focused and it was an opportunity to prove that I can be persistent. I‚Äôm so glad that you made videos for us ‚Äì people from all over the world that can try with you. ¬†And by the way I‚Äôm from Bulgaria. : ))) 
Thank you very much

I have been in the midst of a very difficult time in my life. I have experienced some crushing losses in the past two years. After a while of intermittent and fleeting curiosity, constant anxiety and other negative feelings lead me to give yoga a try. I discovered your videos. I was determined that 2017 would be a new start for me and then I saw the announcement for Yoga Revolution. It has been difficult to always be present, to let everything else go and show up day after day, but after these 31 days I feel much more centered, balanced, accepting, and have found an ability to face difficulties with a calmness of mind not previously available to me. My sincerest thank you. Keep doing what you are doing. It helps.
Namaste.

I have done 30 days of yoga and yoga revolution so I have been doing yoga for 2months now. And I couldn't be happier. This programme gave me motivation, inner peace and changed my body like no other workout did, so im so happyyyy that I have finally found what works for my body.
Thanks to yoga and you I am able to have time for myself (i do not allow drama school in my mat) and also I became more pacient. In september i'm going to university and I just used to be stressed all the time because I don't (didn't) have a passion- like some people have, some people just know all their lives what they want to be like teachers, doctors, etc. But I was so blind trying to found a passion that I couldn't get that my passion is life itself. YES! I'm in love with life, earth, nature, all of this world and I'll trust my gut and I know that if I follow my curiosity I will keep finding good stuff, like yoga and this amazing community. And also it's okay to be just the way I am.

2152,oh my goodness.....I wasn't expecting the flood of emotion today (which made it more spectacular). One of my biggest fears in the past has been practising from within...without verbal instruction. Adriene you guided me through these 31 days and this morning I closed my eyes and moved from my heart allowing my energetic self to take me where I needed to be. On the odd glimpse at the screen I was fascinated to see that I was in synch with you. Tomorrow I shall hit my mat with a huge inner smile and go with my flow...knowing that how I move is exactly how I need to be.  Thank you for providing such a wonderful life changing experience.

2175,"Gotta say -- this was an incredibly emotional, never ending freakout of a half hour for me. I am brand new to any kind of yoga practice and so with me in my ""present"" was the unease of still looking for guidance, the uncertainty of what to do next, of hanging in the silence and craning to see where I was. All the while, having glimmers of seconds where I could feel it, feel what was supposed to be happening, feel where my body has been before. Moments of strength amidst the panic of still wanting and needing a teacher. This was an experiment that showed me what the end result would be, of continued learning and practice. I'm not there yet but I felt it and saw it today -- the future. Thanks for the sneak peek, Adriene. And for all those moments you've taught that this is not necessarily a serious practice. Take it seriously, but also; sing. That, I can do :)",UgiL6fuodU8ufHgCoAEC,0,0,2017-01-31T16:21:20Z,0.9953954815864563

Will see you all soon on the mat again!!!because yoga is not an option anymore!!

I'm sad this particular journey has come to an end (but not my ongoing practice with Adriene).

Spending every day being guided, learning what feels good, has been incredible and today, instead of feeling like I'd been kicked out of the nest, I felt like I'd been given the keys to the candy store, and was able to start the journey of making my own.

You have changed my life in a good way, I am so much happier, calmer, and flexible now and I just feeling sooo much better.
It's so sad that the Revolution has reached to its end, it was sometimes the best part of my day, I was looking forward to go home and do it, spend a little time for myself and just listen to your voice, it fills me with positive energy I have no idea why:D
But every end is a new beginning, and I will definitely start this or 30 days of yoga over tomorrow.
So thank you that you are here for us, I hope thet you live a very happy life because you deserve it^^
