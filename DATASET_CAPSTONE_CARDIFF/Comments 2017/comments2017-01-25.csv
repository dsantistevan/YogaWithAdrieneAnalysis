I just had too many things on one plate, so today, I also practiced forgiveness of myself for not getting everything done that I wanted to. I made a good effort though.

Tree pose is that one asana that is slowly getting better, but the work needs to be put in so I can get that asana right. I know because I tried to get my leg up there and it slid alll the way down to my calf, laughing at me. I‚Äôll just listen to my body next time, lol. I was in heaven with the downward dog in the beginning though, and this is one of my favorite poses. I remember when my arms would scream at me in this pose, and now I love it.

My body was not in the mood to hop up the mat, but the next time it is, I WILL be trying to lift my butt cheeks and fly!

225.0,"FYI- one of these videos around day 20 really hurt my shoulder, upper back.  I should not have tried the twist where tries to put one's head under the shoulder.   Or something like that.   Anyhow, i am not the most coordinated person and probably should not have tried it as it is not a stretch I'm used to doing, so my bad.  By now i have finally learned that it is better to stretch slowly to gain flexibility.  Darn ego sometimes intrudes.  

Thanks for the series.  Most of it was GREAT and perfect.  Trying to get back into shape after four months in France with no yoga.  Wish I had stayed because it is truly an amazing country, but your videos will help me get through having to come back les Etats-Unis.  Can't help where you were born, i guess!  Lol.   Now I really understand why many people are irritated with Americans.  Need to work on being quieter, among other things and your videos have been an enormous help.
