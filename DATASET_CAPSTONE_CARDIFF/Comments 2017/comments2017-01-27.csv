31.0,"Not sure if you see old comments anymore. I have been making my way through your series, oldest to newest, and was absolutely overjoyed when my husband began joining me for my morning practice halfway through yoga camp. But then in Revolution, the practices have included more singing (please, no more singing) and have gotten more philosophical with less time to just be quiet and reflect. I honestly show up every day to get a physical and mental break, and the constant talking can be distracting sometimes. My husband is no longer interested because it was too much and he wasn‚Äôt able to focus. I know you provide this service for us for free and I am so, so grateful. I just wish there was more quiet time, with words for pose instruction and direction instead of so much in between. Some of your videos, the ones where you do the voice overlay, are so incredible bc it‚Äôs only the words pertinent to the poses instead of side stories and song references. Those practices are so powerful. Hoping your next series and the ones after are more focused on that. Hope I didn‚Äôt upset you with my critique, but I just wish the practices were a bit more quiet so we can self-reflect.",UgwaVskSrnNZZ70HqS14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-27T13:19:34Z,0.8832007646560669

So I woke up to do this practice and it was awesome to get the back stretched out and moving the entire midsection.

I did not think I could engage my solar plexus (sp?) at the end there, but it happened! 

Going forward, I need to work on my warrior 1. I can just feel something is off, and warrior 2 is more natural to me.

Through this yoga series, I've been learning that I can find peace in myself, but keep moving. I'm finding I can move through my life with ease, even when it's challenging, instead of coming full stop.

302.0,"Hi Adriene!

I've been following your videos for a few years now (did the original 30 days of yoga and yoga camp), and I want to tell you how grateful I am to have found this channel. Aside from financial restraints, I also deal with severe anxiety that makes it extremely difficult to go to classes with other people.  Following along with your videos has made me feel like I am in my own personal yoga class, and the longer I've been watching the better I have gotten to know the teacher (e.g.-all the little inside jokes). What I like best is that you have something for everyone, or every feeling, every body part, every part of the day. I've recommended you to the girls in my therapy group and to my 6' 200+ pound cousin. I've never commented before, but I just wanted you to know how grateful I am to have you in my home. You've brought a shining light into my life, especially now when the current political climate of the country is grim.

Also, I know you are a musical fan, and I don't know if you're familiar with Hamilton, but every time you say ""rise up,"" I wanna sing, ""when you're living on you're knees you rise up! Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up.""",UgjnmYEuA3unLXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-28T15:39:34Z,0.9988592863082886
