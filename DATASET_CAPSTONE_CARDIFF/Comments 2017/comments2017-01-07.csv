So I told myself to repeat day 6, I'll do it better today because I just will. But then honestly I saw that day 7 was a little shorter (crunched for time because of work) so I said, let's just try today out, try to be kind, see what happens.  And I'm so glad I did. This practice was exactly what I needed. I was feeling so shaky and lost.  Your thoroughness, talking through each point, being kind, was exactly what I needed. This not only grounded me but reminded me I can be the world for myself. I have everything I need.

109.0,"I've been doing Yoga With Adriene for about five years now, but this practice made one of her fundamental insights finally click with me. I'm usually really good at the balancing postures and always enjoy powering through those videos and feeling kind of smug about how good my body is at it. But today I came on the mat with 3 hours of sleep, 1 day before a stressful moving day, 10 days before leaving my country for another one, with loads on my mind - and I struggled. Even just lifting up onto my toes make me fall in all the direction. But I was humbled and able to laugh about it and kept trying and finally understood this message of ""practicing balance and not achieving balance"". I first thought I was unlucky that the balancing practice came on this day for me and I wouldn't be able to enjoy how good I'm usually at it. But then I understood that it was the exact right day. I needed it today exactly *because* I was off balance. The practice gave me the balance that I had lost in my stress. By the end of the video, the meditation seat that usually always pains and troubles me felt comfortable and I could have sat there for days. I don't know what do say. I thought today would be a horrible and tough day, but now I feel ready and relaxed and strong. Bless you, Adriene, for giving those tools to all of us. Without you, I'd have never tapped into yoga, and now I can't live without it anymore.",UgxClt6Lwq7mdUue4xB4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-09-06T11:10:08Z,0.9931881427764893

At the end of all the session, I feel am so relaxed, and all the problems from the day is gone.  I feel rejuvinated and ready for the rest of the day.

By the early evening when I go for a walk, I was thinking I was so glad that I had taken today's class because with thunderstorms rolling in, I didn't think I would get outside for 30 minutes and so I felt good knowing that I did something for myself in the day.

587.0,Really love the Yoga Revolution series so far but there was way too much talking for me during this practice. This constant chatter is distracting and prevents a mindful practice. I couldn't  concentrate on my breath. After a while I didn't even listen anymore and just tuned out. That's why I was really looking forward to the last minute of meditation but even that was interrupted. Having said that I still feel so much better sticking with the program everyday ...,Ugjxv6Hn05MzzngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-02-25T09:38:31Z,-0.9983969330787659

595.0,"This video meant so much to me! I was really adamant about sticking with this 31 day revolution, fully enjoying myself and then I went snowboarding for the first time. Gave myself quite the deep tissue bruise on my buttcheek and took about 10 days off from yoga, or really anything productive. I slipped easily into a rut of laziness and was nervous about coming back to my mat. It was almost like the universe knew my ass was tender and stopped me right before this mostly standing practice. It was the PERFECT way to ease back into my practice and when it was finished I couldn't help but shed a few tears of joy. I'm starting today feel positive, productive, strong and happy.

I've started this challenge last week and I thought I'll probably not be able to follow it every single day, especially because I come home from work quite late. I thought, I'll get to exhilarated by doing a Yoga routine, so I wouldn't be able to fall asleep. 
However, after a week practice I must say I'm looking forward to my half hour in peace each day, no matter what time it is.

I just have one problem with your videos which I have to mention. I get really distracted by all your small-talk through the video. I love the parts when you explain what the poses do, but all the chit-chatter in between actually just becomes a disturbance and quite frankly I feel it's ruining my concentration and focus on the instructions you give.

I have tried meditation before and it is such a calm presence but sometimes i feel like their is a presence in some way other than me, even when i'm alone. 

i'm not sure if it's a form of energy, sometimes i feel a push like a finger gently pushing me back from my third eye points, sometimes i can feel heat around my whole body, sometimes cold fire-like energy in my hands or a gentle push at my back. 

I'm not sure if this is a form of connecting or if this at all normal, so let me know!

1168.0,"For some reason the theme of commitment is really irking me here.. I really enjoy these videos and they are super helpful.. I feel like there is an assumption here that we have all made some sort of new years resolution to do this everyday or something.. except I feel kind of.. idk bad about it. Like I don't have time to do these daily with y'all and I know it's not your intention but the way you are talking about it is kind of making me feel like I'm meant to feel guilty if I'm not doing it every day (like.. idk.. maybe that would somehow let everyone else down..) It's making me feel disconnected from this video. Phrases like ""stick with me, stick with the video"" .. I'm sure your intention isn't to come off as manipulative but it kind of feels that way a little..

Again, I really appreciate these videos and find them super helpful.. it's just.. the idea that I have some sort of responsibility to do them kind of nullifies what I can gain from them by making it no longer about me doing what I need for me but rather about being a part of some ritual or spell you are casting on your audience to control us.

1174.0,"You know what? 2017 is different. I've tried to do daily yoga in the past but was never able to hold to my commitments for, honestly, more than a couple days. But 2016 saw a lot of personal growth and freedom for me, and I finally gave myself permission to find what feels good in LIFE, and not do things out of obligation that just don't feel right. Even my attempts at yoga contributed to that growth and permission as seeds were planted. Everything is not perfect. Life is messy. And I know it's only day 7, but it feels different this year. I'm so glad to have YWA as a resource to help me grow even more in 2017, so thanks so very much and namaste. üôèüèªüòç",Ugh4WcjJ9MnVtXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-07T15:53:50Z,0.9947879314422607

So happy to be on this journey (again) with you and all these beautiful people!
Quick question, sometimes in tree pose (and some other hip poses) I get intense hip 'cramps' and I was wondering what I could do differently to prevent that. It's not like I sag my hips or put pressure on one side or even stand skew!!

1268.0,"I found this one so challenging but glad I stuck with it. Despite practising yoga on and off for years, I woke up with a very sore back and stiff muscles, probably as my core is weak and my back was overcompensating yesterday. I know this will ease out and looking forward to developing my practice in a way that serves me this year. I usually like warriors and triangles but they were a real struggle today. Thank you so much, Adriene, and the YWA community. It's not always easy, everyone's body is different, you may never reach the 'right' shape in some asana poses, but what the heck, it's all about the journey and what a fun and rewarding journey it is.
