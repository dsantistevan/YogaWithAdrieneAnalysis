77.0,"First of all, thank you for creating this content. It must have taken a lot of effort to put this together. 
Warning for beginners: I am a complete beginner to yoga practices and came to this 30 day yoga practice on many recommandations that stated this would be an easy place to get started. I must admit that the practices in and of themselves feel very nice, realtively easy to perform and I enjoyed myself whilst performing them. BUT, the almost constant usage of what I can only describe as confusing and too imaginative language makes it really hard to follow the instructions of the teacher. We are constantly asked to do things where I had  no idea what she was talking about inbetween the clear instructins of move this, stretch that, center this. I assume that this type of terminoligy is generally used in yoga practices, because yoga is not just about stretching, but also about connecting with yourself. For a beginner, though, it becomes really difficult to follow the instructions without constantly breaking form to look at the screen. For beginners I would suggest that you watch the whole video before you actually start the practice. Unless things like ""allow your breath to make room towards your hip"" (exagerated, but if you watch the video you will understand what i mean) are things that will not break your concentration.",UgyJW3bbSRSS8GS8KC54AaABAg,2.0,1.0,2020-08-05T11:53:43Z,-0.9763864874839783

Tired of being tired, I knew I wanted to get back to daily yoga so I thought what better way than a YWA 30 day? And that's why I am here this morning, on day 2!  What a great experience that was!

Despite having breaks in between it was so helpful to be able to return, when I could, to the mat with you. Getting to day 31 felt massive and without a doubt that practise was one of the most powerful I've ever done in five years of yoga. So now I begin again. My intention is to keep to daily practise.

I use to go to gym and watching the video and doing the stretching, I realised that what we were doing in this video is what I had been doing in gym as cool down and warm up exercises, but unlike the gym classes this has more flow and I really understand how we flow gently and slowly from one movement into the next whereas if it was as a cool down or warm up, we would be stopping and starting and I really understand the motion.  

I don't cheat and see what the next video is, but I am really looking forward to Day 3 ... and I am also keeping a journal about my wellness journey and this series of videos are my main focus on getting exercise into my daily routine along with walking for 30 minutes.

And now I'm liking myself more and more, it is a fantastic journey, and I'm totally not a yoga person! I mean, I'm not spiritual at all, don't believe in energies, don't believe in anything we cannot prove. But I do believe in kindness and love. So yes, LOVE, it must be it.

I was a major 30 days of Yoga fan back in 2015 but I let life get in the way and haven't dedicated any of my time to practice for over a year! I was hit by a car only a few days ago and my body has been telling me it is hurting and needs some time to heal but I didn't want to be totally immobile. So I turned to your practice (after a year of hiding out - forgive me!) and I've done day 1 and 2 of the 31 days sessions. My mind and body are thanking me already and I'm starting to feel myself again! Thank you for creating such a beautiful and supportive channel.

452.0,"THANK YOU SO MUCH, Adriene!! I have always wanted to get into yoga, but have always had a difficult time doing so. I am more interested in the spiritual aspects of it, and it seems so many are concerned with using it for exercise. I truly appreciate how often you remind us to breathe and pay attention to our bodies! And I can't tell you how much I appreciate your sense of humor! THAT makes me want to ""come back""!! Thanks to you, I now look forward to my daily yoga time!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!! 

For those of you in the community and on this thread, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ALL OF THE REVOLUTION VIDEOS!!!  Just go to 
https://gumroad.com/l/yoga-revolution

This is also a way we can give back to Adriene (No I am not advertising, I don't even know her personally). I just found this today! It asks for a donation of.. ready for this? $1.00!  Seriously! Again, THANK YOU Adriene!! 

SO if you have the ability to give more, It would be SO awesome if we try and give as much back to her, in appreciation, as she has given to us!! (again, I emphasize, I'm not affiliated with Adriene at ALL! I just believe in giving back to those who give so much for FREE! Contrary to what many people believe, the income she gets is most likely not even close to what she spends in time and money to make the videos. I looked it up and found this article. It's from 2014, but I'm sure the numbers are still close to being the same.
http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-youtube-stars-actually-make-2014-2

SO LET's SHOW HER HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE HER!!! By giving more than a dollar! Even if we all give a mere 5 bucks (and yes, that's a struggle for me as well at this time) I'm sure we can give her as much as she has given, in time, for us. Maybe. Let's try! :)

This was beautiful! I love that you are teaching through love, kindness, and breath. This is my second day with you, as I am one day behind. I will catch up when I have extra time during this week. This is only my 5th ever yoga class.  I was concerned that this would not be an in person class and that I would not feel a connection with you.  That is not the case at all. I feel like you are right here with me in my living room.  Thank you for sharing your love and light with me. I am looking forward to our journey of Intention and Sukha.

So today I just find out that I was doing the videos from 2016 ;) Such a shame. But now I've signed up, subscribed and pressed the bell so I'm prepared for tmr :)

My husband and I have been having a hard time getting pregnant for the past year and a half and I feel that the journey has been a vicious cycle because it has made me become very self-concious, which only works against my body. I am hoping that if I use this experience to center myself and get my mind in a better place that it will help. Thank you for not only inspiring me, but also for the many lives you inspire daily.

just one question and I hope it doesn't sound ungrateful, is there any chance of releasing these a little earlier so I can do them on the same day in Australia? I know all the time zones are a little awkward, the same time-ish you send the email is perfect. If not possible, no worries happy to follow when available, just thought I would ask :)
