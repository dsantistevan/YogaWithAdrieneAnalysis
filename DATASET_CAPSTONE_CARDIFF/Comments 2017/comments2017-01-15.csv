1.0,Loved this today! Had to split the practice into two sessions so I did 15 mins this morning and 15 this evening and got the biggest smile when I had my most successful crow yet (which was about a millisecond with both feet a tiny bit off the mat). Huge win and a huge smile right now. This is my 4th 30-day challenge in a row and am committed to keep practicing! ‚ù§Ô∏è,UgyEKyAcXju2jXs-Sih4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-16T05:34:16Z,0.9997747540473938

And after practice, I repeated the pose just to make sure I wasn't imagining things. XDD, (it turned out before I couldn't do it because I was making some technical mistakes, once I figure it out the pose felt much much easier). 3 months of yoga with Adriene and magic just happened. I'm so grateful. The journey is so much fun and it's not about poses. I wasn't putting any time limits for me to achieve this one, I was just doing yoga and listening to my body and it just happened.

53.0,"Amazing practice. It sure did bring that fire (and the frustration that comes with that), but I really felt a breakthrough in this practice. I got on the mat feeling frustrated and got even more so when I found I wasn't able to hold the high lunges for as long as the video, especially because in the past I felt like I have ""mastered"" that pose before. I tend to take a week break in between the 31-days videos because it's been hard to motivate myself to be consistent everyday, but I know I'll return at some point even when it takes me more than 31 days to complete. I was just getting mad at myself for ""being out of practice"" and just felt like my body was failing me. Then Adriene said ""What is your body telling you? Listen. Have a conversation"", and boom. That changed how I was thinking about the practice and my body (that I was failing it by not listening more than it was failing me for feeling in pain during the high lunge). I have never been able to come even close to a crow's pose before, but today, I got closest than I've ever been. Still not both feet up, but I got one feet off the ground without shaking (but that got ""ruined"" after I realised I was doing something cool and got so excited that I nearly fell). Even when I started feeling like I am in the worst shape ever to start this practice, I ended up reaching a milestone once I let my body lead the practice as opposed to my expectations.

I started to collect my favourite quotes from your videos, they are really worthy!


Thes are from today's practice:


And fear often takes over when you are not actually paying attention to what our body, our heart is saying. Have you ever caught yourself doing something, and you're like, 'Why ami I doing this? I know this isn't good for me, I dont need this, I dont want this. It's a habitual thing.""

Don't think about the future, what's happening, ""a little chair pose"", try to stay present. Trust the practive, trust your experience. Don't decide what's happening or what's going to happen, just be in the now.


PS.: Since 50 days 95% (except 1-3 days) I practice yoga every morning with your videos.

Still love it, but I have so far to go, and I don't think I will ever have slim yoga thighs, not in my genes, so some poses just will never happen.  Thanks for pushing me to widen my limits.

172.0,"2018 Yoga: Day 42 - June 17

Struggling to hold the poses actually helped me forget about my worries and problems and brought me to the present, even for just 30 minutes. Your message about fear - that it comes from us either dwelling in the past or worrying about the future - has hit me hard. I am in the not-so-joyful phase in my life right now and fighting depression. Sometimes, when I am watching your videos, I wonder how you remain optimistic all the time. I wish I can do that and not let anyone affect my mentality, but it is a cruel world out there. I am tired of feeling this way. But I will keep trying my best to stay in the moment, to be grateful for the life I live, to be fearless and fierce (maybe not now, but someday), that I can breathe and do things with my body, like yoga. That I have a family, good friends, and a patient and understanding hubby. Thanks for the reminder, Adriene.

I couldn't wait to get home and tune into day 15, and put into practice what was spoken and this time around, I was counting my breathing through the nose and exhaling through the mouth on each movement.  I am finally understanding the wellness side of what yoga can give someone and being on a journey where I am wanting to improve my wellbeing due to my breast cancer journey, I am finally connecting the dots.

At the start of my breast cancer journey, I was tuned into wellness but I never thought that it was going to be a journey that I would have been taking, but with health issues rearing its head after finishing cancer treatment and not coping with daily life because of fatigue and being diagnosed with new health problems, I had to find myself doing something and this path that lead to yoga is really making me think more about myself and the process of trying to improve myself both mentally and physically, and so this revolution is the thing that I needed.  It gives me purpose when it comes to centring on my own wellness.  I am taking each day at a time and I am not over exerting myself to the point that I am losing motivation.  Taking one session a day pushes me to switch on the day after, and I have gotten myself in such a routine that I do look forward to 30 minutes where I close the door, make a connection to my inner self and find peace and serenity at the end.

My mind is still clicking over when I am on the mat, and I do try and clear my mind of thoughts, but instead of thinking of tomorrow, I was thinking about what was to follow after the 30 minutes was up.  I am using the time on the mat to connect to myself and to challenge myself while being mindful but at the same time, my mind is still clicking over.    

I am looking forward to tomorrow and a new challenge.",UgzAaX9s9d_58E7aw194AaABAg,2.0,0.0,2017-12-07T10:43:36Z,0.9841176271438599

230.0,"2 weeks ago I wouldn't have been able to get through this sequence with the calmness and the trust that I brought to the mat today, after 14 days of Yoga Revolution. 
I am a professional dancer and had to have knee surgery a few months ago; I still have 5 months of the rehabilitation process ahead of me and yoga is helping me regain confidence in my knee and my whole body whilst giving it time and space with the things I still can't do after such a long time of rest and of not being allowed many kinds of exercise. The Yoga Revolution programme is doing a fantastic job at training both my physical and my mental fitness to prepare myself for trusting my body in dance again in a few months. 
This was just a really long-winded way of saying thank you, Adriene. 

My journey has led me to doing many things that I didn't realise were a part of me before I injured myself, one of them being the fact that I am writing a blog about life and its ups and downs. If you are interested, I invite you to have a read:

When I started this 31 day challenge I realized I had lost more of my muscle tone and balance than I thought and discovered I couldn't achieve the crow pose anymore (it's always been a tricky one for me anyway). So, one of the goals I set for myself was to be able to do it by the end of this challenge. Tonight, on just day 15, I did it! It was only for about 4 or 5 seconds, but I still did it :) My new goal is to be able to do it more comfortably and to be able to find my groove in it more easily. I think I can do it by the end of the 31 days. Thanks again for making such a fun, laid-back but challenging, go-at-your-own-pace environment to practice yoga in.

My journey with Yoga started four years ago, but an injury in my arm, stopped me from continuing. Now, I'm back on the mat and so happy!

My breathing is still a bit off, at times I cannot fully straighten my legs and I've noticed I can maintain balance much better on my right (I've noticed from the comments that it's normal to be stronger on one side of your body), but I cannot wait till the end of the 31 days, because it would be great to see how much my body has grown and gotten stronger as well as how much it has toned. But I am committed to completing everyday and continuing on my Yoga journey afterwards as well.

And then the practice today turned out to be way more though than all the others. But I still managed to do it without having to take a break. I even managed to hold crow pose for like 10 seconds. What I'm taking out of this.

555.0,This is by far my favorite made me struggle just enough to feel it and wake up. These are awesome and seeing that my body just always feels different reminds me that every day is different. I'm still trying to react to disappointment much more properly and not be a perfection and this weekend was about forgiving myself.

557.0,"Hi, Adriene! Warmest greetings from Belarus!
I watch Yoga Revolution videos on your website but came here to leave a comment and send you a huge thanks. And that's why i'm insanely grateful:
Starting this year with your videos and having not missed one so far was one of the best decisions i've ever made. I watched your videos before but only with Yoga Revolution did you manage to make me see yoga in a completely different way, not only as a quirky way to exercise but actually a tool to keep your mind in a state of strength, peace and balance as well. I am still amazed at how good your daily topics combine with the physical part of the practice, turning these 30 minutes on the mat into an exercise for my mind and soul. Your yoga (and i can't stress _your_ enough) helped and helps me go through my daily life with ease, actually changing the way I think and act for the better. And apart from being very proud of myself for sticking with the daily practice, I also started to feel more proud of myself for becoming a better person. And this is a great feeling which I have you to thank :)
The part that mesmerizes me the most is this: every day small and big challenges arise in my life concerning everything from work to personal life. And somehow the topic of our daily practice always covers exactly the same problem I've been dealing with the whole day: when my thoughts were very distracted, yoga helped me bring more attention and awareness to life, when I was hard on myself you helped me honor myself in the present state, or like today, when I almost succumbed to fear, you helped me cope with it with the means of yoga.  Now every time I open your letters (which are awesooome by the way!) I can be sure that i'll find something very good to learn and help me, and knowing that makes me even stronger.
I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for people all over the world. Sincerely wishing you a lifetime of bliss and happiness,
Daria.",Ugh7-Iz1FmA8Z3gCoAEC,1.0,7.0,2017-01-15T12:49:48Z,0.9996390342712402

I am just so curious: why made you take out the mantras and the focus on the spiritual side this time around? You added it to last year's yoga challenge and it feels like it's missing this time around and it's much more focused on movement and muscles and less on the mind set and the spirit.
