Amidst all that is happening I have pushed away the house clutter to lay out my mat rather than created space for my head and mat with yoga .

As I return mentally it is I realize it is no wonder I have experienced increasing difficulty in participation.

Most likely while I was out biking on a dirt road, a rock I must have rode on must have sent a jolt to my left knee. I enjoy both exercises, so this was a very reluctant decision. Fortunately, my knee is better, so I hopped on the mat. One thing I noticed was that I didn't feel flushed while doing folds, for lack of a better term.

123.0,"I love the fact that yoga is so ancient. With all of the knowledge we have and technological advancements, science still doesn‚Äôt understand how the ancients were right about so many things, especially healing the body, mind, and spirit naturally. Yoga practice gives me a place to put down my roots while I‚Äôm busy trying to grow my branches. 

I‚Äôve slowly developed space, self-care and healing, regularity in my physical body, and reversal of a disorder that would‚Äôve been life changing had it progressed. I honestly can‚Äôt wait for my next physical in a few weeks so I can tell my Dr. exactly what changes I‚Äôve made in order to achieve all of the goals she set for me. I‚Äôm not down to my exact goal weight yet, but I‚Äôm getting there in a healthy way, slow and steady, and with pure enjoyment. Yoga is a HUGE part of that. 

Adriene, I don‚Äôt think we could thank you enough for making yoga accessible to us like this.

I often find when sitting  crossed legged or with legs out in front that I am gripping with my hip flexers and thighs. I struggle to relax them at all. Is there anything I could do to get my body used to relaxing that area in those poses? I have the same challenge with my neck when doing core work but I remember a tip you have in another video of working the core as much as possible when you find your neck tensing.
