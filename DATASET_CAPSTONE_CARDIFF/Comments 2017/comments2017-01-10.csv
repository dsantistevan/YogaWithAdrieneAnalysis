80.0,I  find when I soften that my body feels more. Not putting pressure whenever it isn't needed. There is a difference between energy and pressure which I'm learning with every 30 day journey. Have a bad knot in my left shoulder blade and it's not going away so doing some of the poses where painful but still mindfully went through them. Hate having knots as it makes my back not as supple but with time and patience I'm sure it will go. Thanks Adriene xx,UgwDKyeeAv99jQfRcKN4AaABAg,0.0,5.0,2020-04-28T10:43:56Z,0.9948417544364929

It's been a challenge to come back to my mat after a couple of weeks (2months? 3?) of absence.
Yoga was a discovery that changed me. Two years and a half ago, it came into my life when I needed it most. It allowed me to support my own self in troubled times and I shifted my mindset from defining myself by my troubles to defining myself as a young yogi learning each day, good or bad. 
I am feeling this mindset coming back today. Day 10 was sooo sweet.

I still dont like guided meditation, the notion of a 3rd eye makes my eyes roll, I dont see myself ever flying in crow, and my heels STILL dont touch the ground in DD. But Ive learned to modify both physically and mentally when needed and every once in a while I do something I couldn't think I could. Today when you went to third eye, my namaste hands pointed skyward and launched gracefully like a rocket headed into the universe. It was sooooo satisfying for me!

157.0,"AFTER yesterday's late start and feeling exhausted after a long day of being out, today, I walked in the morning and then before 12pm, I was switched on to Day 10 of the Yoga Revolution.  

I still felt tired and I had heavy legs and felt as I was ready for a rest, but instead of resting, I was focused on doing Day 10, and taking note that there is only 3 more weeks to go.

Like always, I took the class at my own pace and it was so nice to just let the body sink into the floor and let the body relax.  Unlike yesterday, I was so relaxed through out today's session and I felt as though I was in a good place all the way through.  I concentrated on my breathing and taking breaths in through the nose and breathing out through the nose and also concentrating on posture and movement.  It was like slowly waking up and stretching instead of waking up and just getting out of bed.

At the end of the 30 minutes, I felt as though my limbs were weightless and like always, I felt light headed.  I was completely relaxed and feeling so good, compared to when I wake up in the morning and I still feel tired.  I feel as though I have gone through a message and I feel as though I am in a good place which is a good thing to know.

Thank you Adriene for this challenge as I wake up each day, knowing that I have you to coach me through 30 minutes of movement and where  I am taking the time for me.",UgwmnGqu59du4xZapmR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-12-02T02:27:14Z,0.9989367127418518

I also have a question I was hoping you could please help me with.
When we're in comfortable seated position in the beginning of the video, I can't sit up tall for more than a few seconds, my entire back (the muscles I assume) starts ""burning"" is that normal? I've been doing your videos 5-7 days a week since mid January and I just started these 31 days, so now day 10 in a row and it still ""burns"". I've tried sitting on a thick book as I don't have a block, it helps a tiny bit but not enough I feel like, so I don't use it.

320.0,"Loving kindness for the American Democratic political party, may their Manipura chakra be in ideal health rendering them the willpower and energy they need to increase environmentally friendly activities and to create a USA of majority middle class citizens and greatly greatly diminish, if not completely eradicate the existence of extreme wealth-which brings foolishness for self and suffering for others- and extreme poverty which brings suffering for self and bad karma to others. Loving kindness, may we continue on as a capitalistic society and democratic government (honoring federal President Hillary Clinton), distinguished by the voluntary morality and wisdom of our citizens who are of all heritages and thus learn indirectly from all around the world. (Lovingkindness, because the third eye of the United States citizen is sensitive enough to instinctly search for freedom (which may or may not involve money) rather than money alone.)

Loving kindness for several native american proverbs on this same subject. (hesed US quoted here)

Loving kindness, may it be easy for American citizens to resist temptations of excessive power by means lacking virtue which undermine the ideals of the Nation (freedom, equality of origin/heritages/genders, justice, respect for nature & attainment of lasting happiness)

Loving kindness, may government employees at high easily recognizeable levels, middle levels, & low not be depicted as being inspired mainly by financial ideation, but by virtue and enjoyment of responsible freedom in this natural world.

Loving kindness, for all purposes government is exempt from financial restraints because it operates from a higher level of perception based on sustaining (aided in no small part by the natural environment of our fair country - we can never truly own the land) a neutral and nourishing foundation for all citizens, who in turn play the game of civilian life, including dealing with finances.

Loving kindness, in contrast the real federal government is not civilian life and is not associated with finance or lack thereof but is transcendent. All ideations of debt hanging over the US government are therefore effectively dissolved and acknowledged as myth.

Perhaps in an immature and unawakened blind world, the USA would incarnate under a huge debt and be forced to sell away its treasures to a businessman who holds no real regard for our country's history or message. Fortunately this is not the case. 

American citizens are self empowered to their own dream, not giving power away to a money scheme that infringes on our dignity and rights to relax. Loving kindness, President Clinton is governing the United States of America.

the businessman is a slave to money, & not even as free as the beginner meditator, not considered truly american by philosophy. 

Loving kindness, certain expanses, certain quantities are too great for the individual mind to fathom.. 

(think of it like this, if you meditate on government from a third eye perspective, you see the average citizen as perhaps a intermediate monk.

a high level government official is therefore by comparison like a buddha, its not that money is absent or abundant in the buddhas life, its that this individual is a buddha and all their actions are balanced and unbiased, therefore money, nor personal relationship and ego, nor violence can control them. they are transcendent and the vital essence is preserved. 

otherwise our government is only corruption, exit roleplay freely, this is not a wasteful land)",UghWBugZpbvcDXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-15T23:42:47Z,0.5625183345174614
321.0,"After having a wonderful weekend getaway with friends, I received a text message from my boss saying that he's cutting my shifts this week. I felt so bad and unappreciated.

This morning after this practice I cracked and cried a little. It's been a long time since I cried in a yoga class.... I felt soooo much relief, like a got rid of a big burden... This is definitely a sign and a new opportunity to just keep on going forward.

Thanks so much for sharing the practice of yoga in a cheerful and loving way Adriene. I started following your videos when I arrived to Sydney last July.

386.0,"So listen, yesterday I had to skip my yoga because I was sick as a dog with a stomach bug and barely had the energy to move, and when I saw that it was a more challenging practice I knew I had to pass. Then today I've got a non-stop running nose so I started yoga with a kleenex hanging out of one nostril and I had to laugh when -- more today than in any previous video -- you kept specifying that we should breathe through our noses. I just reminded myself that I need to honor where I'm at today, and today I'm a mouth breather so I'm going to accept that.

Thank you for this journey, Adrienne. This revolution came into my life at the perfect time, surely in the need for physical strengthening but definitely in the need for self-discovery and peace with myself. On one of the first days you said we should commit to honoring ourselves exactly where we're at today, and I almost cried. I'm so used to feeling like I need to be more, and it's been so much easier to come here every day knowing that I can come as I am.",UgjvBmH5wVAHzHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-11T04:33:28Z,0.5044811964035034

522.0,"Loved it and my shoulders are feeling so good. I found the ""pickle jar"" suggestion so helpful in learning to keep the outward rotation and also the thoughtful :-) indications on the lower ribs and generally....YES a really careful thoughtful practice which is helping me feel ease in stiff shoulders and be more mindful in cat/cow sphinx ext.

524.0,"Hi guys! I havent done today¬¥s yoga practice because I¬¥m still in school, but I have a question for you guys... My mum hurt her head pretty badly this summer, and is capable of doing 1/10 of what she used too. It really frustrates her, knowing she can¬¥t do all the things she used to do. You know, she had like 5 jobs, and now she cant do the laundry... I really want her to try yoga with me, and I¬¥m looking for a slow, calm and not as challenging physically and mentally :) I don`t want to make things even worse for her, but I really think yoga can make her a bit happy, and calm. Accepting where she`s at today. haha, sorry for a really long text... If not responding, thanks for reading :) Have a lovely day:)",UghvsOnACtzch3gCoAEC,2.0,0.0,2017-01-10T08:30:37Z,-0.9614109992980957

529.0,You're right!! That was yummy. My back body was loving all that stretching. And that prompt to empty my lungs completely......I never knew how much air I wasn't letting out. It just kept coming! The first full breath after that was probably one of the most amazing things I have ever felt! Beautiful.

530.0,"I'm loving this. Even since I started a few months ago, I regained an inch of height. I was becoming an armadillo. But more importantly, I feel better about myself a little at the time, every time I leave the mat. The phrase that has stuck the most with me and that has helped me go back to being a person after being an armadillo for a while has been ""make some room for yourself"" I do physically and I do mentally. Thank you. I'm so happy I'm inviting all the people I can to live this experience.

531.0,"Hey Adriene! I've been doing yoga with you for over a year. I started when I stayed in Europe for a few months doing it like every day and have continued somewhat until now. Been doing the revolution which has been the best thing you've done, for me at least. I love it! I HAVE A PROBLEM DOE. While doing yoga with you I discovered my hips pop when I move my legs from up towards ceiling to earth, laying down. So laying flush with the hips down and all that you love to do, since its good for you, kinda sucks for me. I'm just wondering if you've heard of these types of things mending back to normal after doing yoga. I haven't done it hardcore for the past year but am doing it daily now. I work from a computer and its definitely done some things to me even tho i look like i somewhat go to a gym and exercise ha, lucky me! I'd love any feedback to know what you've seen n heard?",UghXvKA0k48EVngCoAEC,1.0,0.0,2017-01-10T07:18:31Z,0.9974468946456909
