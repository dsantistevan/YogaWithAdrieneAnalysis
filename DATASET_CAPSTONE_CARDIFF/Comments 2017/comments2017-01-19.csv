Anyway, I don't think I've commented on any of your videos before but I have to on this one. WOG to me actually has a real meaning. I used to walk/job several miles daily. When I left my house I'd let my family know I was going for a WOG. I love to jog but have never been able to work myself up to being a ""jogger"". I ALWAYS have to stop and walk.  Wogging made me feel like more than just a walker but quite a jogger :). That's what WOG means to me.

I can ground down through my feet and legs, do side plank, go from low lunge to plank without faffing around, stay still and find calmness and peace when in mountain pose with hands to heart, kept my cool by thinking ""lots of love in lots of love out"", find flow through breathing, learnt how to breathe, sit up straight and walk tall by thinking "" head over heart, heart over hips"", learnt how to claw my fingers when in downward facing dog, found something to keep me going when things get tough and probably many other things I cannot remember but I am sure looking forward to my feet flat on the ground doing downward facing dog.

I am really curious to know what other uploads Adriene has on her site as I went from doing The Self Love Yoga to this revolution journey.

In the last 20 days, I didn't think I was making many steps when it comes to improving my health and wellbeing, but I am finally noticing the small changes that have come through with these challenges.  I am focused on my breathing, I am pushing myself to my limits and I am trying to improve my yoga journey by staying with this programme through the 30 minutes, and taking a new step by following Adriene.  I still don't have flexibility but I am not worried but at least I am finding time in my day to really focus on myself and don't let the outside world get in my way.

Yesterday, I could have given up because family came around and it is so easy to say ""I won't do it, I will do it later"", but I stuck to my guns and found the 30 minutes in the morning to make this happen.  I am always grateful at the end of each session that I took the time, to come to the mat, work within my limit and also push new boundaries because when the time is up, I am always in a good place and I look forward to continuing my day.",UgyeZ4Li7ziPU2ymcMt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-12-12T02:35:43Z,0.9987199306488037

I took something so frivolous and made it into such a big thing...I am ashamed of myself and still think about calling everyone (not that many..2-3 friends) that I called that day and apologize for crying for after such a small and insignificant ""failure"". HOWEVER with this in mind, I must and will learn that sometimes we will just over-react and sweat the small stuff and only later will we realize that we actually have a beautiful life...a hard one but beautiful that just sometimes comes with failures as well. A freaking failed driving exam means nothing...I have a wonderful dog (a bit crazy but still...wonderful), a loving boyfriend, lovely parents that waited for me with chocolate eclairs when they heard I failed my exam, cause they knew the amount of money I've spent and the plans I had with it...but OH WELL.. the bottom line is , no matter how hard it was for me to do this practice, I will re-do it today when I go home because I know I can do better :) .
