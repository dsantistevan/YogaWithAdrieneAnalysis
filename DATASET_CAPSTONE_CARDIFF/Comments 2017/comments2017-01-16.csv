5.0,"Hmm it's definitely a difficult situation but I don't think I 100% agree with what you said about offering a different perspective, it's of course good to always stay positive, but some situations (like back pain) just suck and its okay to sometimes dwell/grief about it. Acceptance comes naturally and saying 'it won't go away if you think like that' can come off as invalidating their feelings, like they aren't allowed to feel it or something. Idk if you meant that but just my 2 cents on the matter",Ugz-SooVnG2qdnSFrOZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-11-10T15:00:32Z,0.51344895362854

176.0,"After waking up tired and having a late breakfast, the first thing I did for myself, was Day 16 of the Yoga Revolution.

Today's practice was about being sweet to yourself and I have to say, I have to say, that is something that I have been practicing for a while without really knowing it.  Even with this yoga challenge, I have been sweet to myself, by pushing myself through the daily challenges but not being hard on myself throughout because I have only been doing yoga for 17 days and with my wellness being on the low, I am listening to my body and knowing what is an acceptable level of pushing myself to the limit.  

To me, being sweet is being kind to yourself.  This week during my therapy session, a question was put forth to me about if I had accepted that I had been through a lot in the last year, and I said yes. To me, that is being sweet to yourself, knowing you have you been on path that has changed who you are mentally and physically and because of this I have found that I am on a new path that is about being sweet to myself even though the hard part is over.  Like everyone says, everyone is different, while I didn't struggle through chemotherapy and radiotherapy, it has taken until this year to realise that my body has been on a really long and hard journey and although some people go back to work with no problems, I was struggling.

I did go back knowing I wasn't quite there but I pushed myself thinking I was capable of doing at least one shift but it took a few months to realise that I wasn't capable of working to my full potential as I would go home and for the next two days or more feel fatigued.  I am even feeling the tiredness now when I try and push myself through the day instead of taking things easy.

To me being sweet is listening to my body and knowing when to stop and recover and that is where I am today.  

ps  Adriene asked us what our favourite sweet is, I am like Adriene where I like my savouries and I am really a chip person (potato crisps), and I like cheese and biscuits but for sweets, I do like the occasional piece of chocolate and cake.",UgyNjR5EM0QQk7PPdoZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-12-09T01:47:44Z,0.976592481136322

Other than lots of P.T./yoga/exercise the best things I found was Neuroplasticity. It's the same therapy used for stroke victims.

271.0,"I really like this series, but I was upset about this video. I felt that was a very cavalier (and not kind) way to discuss someone's pain that they have accepted as chronic. As someone who has a very serious chronic pain disease, I know that it is a HUGE act of self-love to accept your body for what it is, which includes the pain it gives you. It is so, so difficult to drown out all the judgy people out there who dismiss your pain as ""in your head"" and tell you to just not think about it or exercise more or eat differently or get your ears pierced or whatever. There are tons of lifestyle changes that can sometimes help with pain - trust me, I've tried what I feel like has to be all of them - but some of us have real, serious medical conditions that mean we're going to be in pain no matter how hard we try to follow all of the positive thinking and lifestyle change advice. That's just how chronic illness works. It sucks when someone doesn't understand what you've gone through and acts like they know the solution to your problem. I can guarantee you that people who have chronic pain have spent a lot of time thinking about what's happening to them, reading about it, going to doctor after doctor after doctor (and sometimes chiropractor after physical therapist after osteopath after accuptuncturist), which is to say: they know their body, and they probably have a better understanding of what's happened to it than bystanders. And, making comments about what other people are doing wrong with regards to their bodies treads in the direction of blaming the patient for what's happened to them, even when they are doing their absolute best to sort out the bad advice from the good advice and make all the lifestyle changes recommended by their doctors and chiropractors and others. I'm just saying, let's hold of the judgement here...it's hard enough to deal with chronic pain without everyone telling you that you're doing it wrong.",Ugg2c1yOS-VDlXgCoAEC,0.0,2.0,2017-03-17T02:40:28Z,-0.9950066804885864

I've done therapy and yoga and stretches and pain killers and heat and cold etc.all these things to make the pain go away, but it hasn't done so.

three reasons why you are jolly bloody brilliant at this yoga malarchy  drums and trumpets with a pied piper and a wee mouse in downward facing dog please.!
1. your humour.
2. your talk through is clear precise and calm

I work out regularly so it's not physically too difficult (except for the crow, of course! I'm not there yet), but I'm a really squirrely person so I have a hard time with the breathing and doing things slowly. Lucky for me, you're an excellent teacher! I'm so impressed with your level of body consciousness. Today's practice was particularly good. A back story: a few years ago, I broke my wrist and had to have surgery to get a metal plate put in. It took a year of physical therapy and another surgery to get things back to normal. I couldn't drive for 8 months. At the end of today's practice, when you had us touch our middle fingers to our thumb and then touch our other fingers, I got really emotional. I wasn't able to do that for a long time after breaking my wrist, and I just felt so, so grateful for having the full use of my hand back -- something we definitely take for granted in our day-to-day lives!

439.0,"Hi Adriene,

I've now been doing your videos for nearly a full year without a day's break (I was forty last January and it changed my life, for the good).  I must say though that Day 16 was one of the most frustrating videos I have seen of yours.  

Firstly, the initial fold: I can get my legs flat down and stay upright but I cannot bend more than a few inches forward.  I'd love to hear some allowance for this, as this part of my body seems to be my least flexible and toughest to work with (lower back, I presume).  I have good core strength, I'm slim and toned but that doesn't help with this.

Secondly: cow legs.  Again, something in my body type does not allow for this.  When crossing over the legs and going to sink back, I simply end up on one buttock with the other in the air, the hip not dropping.  If I tried to maintain a central lowering, I fear I'd badly damage a knee or my hip.  The video angles don't help and this seems rushed.  With absolute love, I must question how safe this is for beginners if Revolution were the first thing they tackled.  I know you talk about finding what feels good (which I do, so I just sat cross-legged, feeling slightly irked...mindfulness wandered) but any new yogis might feel obliged to push on.  I've felt this with a few things on the new series, that it pushes slightly hard for a total newcomer (e.g. the first video, when raising both legs without warning of the need for lower back support - this seemed potentially damaging).

I hope you take this constructively.  I love your videos.  They have truly enhanced my life (mind and body).  Keep up the good work!

PS - I had my first injury in a year yesterday when lowering into a yogic squat and something between hip and sit bone twanged - thankfully, it's alright today.",UgitSVHj-Ly4a3gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-17T06:36:11Z,0.8315085768699646
