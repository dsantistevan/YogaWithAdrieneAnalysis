3.0,"Wow... What a day. I would like to thank Adriene and all the people behind the camera for this most amazing project. It's not about only physical aspect, it's also so therapeutic in its own, gentle way. I'm currently doing December 21 calendar and finishing Revolution, haven't missed a day this time (it's my 5th revolution) and today I suddenly felt so happy, thankful and hopeful. These feelings were so real and strong, I haven't felt this way for a long time. I had very rough year due to the traumatic birth experience and completely lost myself.  And now I can say that I'm coming back to myself and it feels soooo good.

This creativity practice started nicely as always and then! The video stopped loading (I was staying at a friend's place) - so I said to myself - this is a creativity practice, I'll just do my own creative yoga sequence, and I did! And you were there with me, in my mind, giving instructions on how to move, how to tap into my inner smile and how to feel confident that by now I know what to do! I'm in love with yoga so much that nothing can stop me from practicing! 
So thank you again, you shining star of positivity and health! I wish you a Merry Xmas and can't wait for the new 30 day challenge to start on January 2021!! 
All the best, all the love to all of you practicing friends around the world, keep it up, you are awesome!

I was so happy living from the eyebrow up that any movement/physical practice was awkward, weird and terrifying. When I had the courage to try Yoga I religiously stuck to you but 4 years in my body was ready to move onto cardio (again the fear and terror came up). So I tried some workouts from Pamela Reif and MadFit and wow...the quality of space you hold Adriene and your guidance is very very different. I got the sweat I needed although it seems it‚Äôs coming at the expense of my relationship and rapport to my body and self. The obnoxious pop or dance music doesn‚Äôt seem to help (I often mute them to focus on my breath and quality of movement) and the one minute of one exercise is really too short - once I feel I‚Äôve got a hang of it and I‚Äôm enjoying the movement and breath and it‚Äôs over, onto the next one. Reif doesn‚Äôt explain how to do it healthily without injuring yourself so I rely on what you‚Äôve told me. You‚Äôre practically installed in my head at this point!!

69.0,"I think I just understood what going with the flow means. 
Sometimes we take our expectations, perspectives and definitions of certain things for granted so that we get hit by a wave when things turn out to be different.
Now, it occured to me that this is natural and that it can actually be profitable to learn - not only on our own but also from and with others.

How many times have I realised that I tensed because I wasn't content with how a situation went or how something is.
Yet, I don't have any influence on certain aspects and instead I found myself thinking that even if it didn't go as planned it will still lead to something great. 
Maybe even greater than expected.
Maybe it happened because I needed to find or learn something, to get stronger or maybe it happened because I was just not ready.

What I've learned is that everything happens for a reason and ""everything is as it should be"" (- as you said, Adriene).
Today, I still find myself stressing over things I can't control but now I am able to cut the loop by breathing in and out, smiling and telling myself what I really need to hear.
No feeding of that anxious, scared or aggressive inner voice but calming it and reassuring that something great can always happen with just a little more patience. 

A big part of this new mindset comes from you.
Adriene, you've had a huge influence on my life so far and I'm incredibly grateful for that.
However, a lot of things we have to learn and find out by ourselves.   
Yes, we learn from and with others as I said but we have to make our own experiences as well.
We have to go our own way while assisting and being assisted by others. 

Seems like I also got the ""serving others"" thing now üòÇüëè",UgzNnBZDLEUrjw8G1fV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-06-18T08:08:55Z,0.996483325958252

Yoga has become a place of stability and comfort for me, even when I struggle to get to the mat or the practice is super challenging. I never expected it to go so deep with me but I take my yoga off the mat and everywhere I go without even thinking about it now.
