The left side was more challenging, so I just moved my leg in and out a few times before settling in a position with my knee bent & holding my ankle :) Compared to the Move series we are moving much slower... Sometimes it feels very slow, but this way we also have the time to really get into the movements :)",UgyU0W6Jqc-2ly-85-J4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-16T07:49:46Z,0.9758283495903015

103.0,"Why *did* I start this practice... what a great question I haven‚Äôt asked myself.  As with everything, the answer is ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù... a dance major was required to take the ‚Äòbody modalities‚Äô course, taught by Allison Green‚Äîa highly trained dancer and yogi‚Äî in which we covered so many techniques to addressing the body. Feldenkrais, Alexander, gyotechnics, Rolfing, Pilates, and a slew of other techniques were covered. But daily, we practiced yoga. We worked up to holding poses for two full minutes‚Äîour bodies screaming for release as she walked around to analyze our form as suggest corrections (my right knee was my key problem area and I remember her sweet whisper near my ear, ‚Äúrotate from the hip, externally, drawing the knee open and over the pinky toe.‚Äù
I signed up for the class because it was required for my major. By the end of the semester, I had grown by 3/4 of an inch and my knee pain had changed. I continued practicing because it brought me peace and centering through my undergrad.

Ofc, I've got a long way to go, but I'm so glad to have stuck to the programme so far! Also, Adrienne is such a supportive teacher, even if she can't see me or anything, her small comments like ""we'll catch you if you fall"" are exactly what I need to keep on going, to get through and keep on trying for the pose even if it feels impossible to me.

I have always had good balance and so I didn't struggle with the balancing, I only struggled with my flexibility.  I did feel the burn in the legs and the torso while balancing on my left and right leg and I have to say, I really look forward to the time we spend on the mat and on our backs stretching, even if I can't do ""happy baby"" or any of the other movements where we bring our hands to our feet.  Like Adriene said, it will take time and I am not pushing myself to make it happen, I am concentrating on getting through 30 minutes and knowing that I had done a core work out in my day.

And then when we did it again, I ""heard"" my lower back on my right side start to speak, as weird as that sounds, along with a muscle in my hip.

200.0,"Adriene, I have so much to say to you and have no idea where else I can say it than here... so I really hope you see this. I've been attempting your Yoga Revolution series since the beginning of the year, but have always fallen off the wagon. The first time it was around day 15, the 2nd time it was day 21, the 3rd time I barely got far at all... and now 11 days into the 4th attempt, things are starting to click and I'm wondering if what I'm feeling now is exactly what you intended with this series all along. 

Last night doing your Thoughtfulness practice, I kept my eyes closed the entire time and really took it to heart. I felt a sensation that I've never felt during yoga...I suppose it's what it means to ""feel"" mindfulness? With my eyes closed, it's as though I could feel how every movement being done was affecting the muscles of my body, and it made me sort of tingly and lightheaded. I couldn't even really open my eyes because I was feeling everything all at once so intensely. It was so odd but also something special, so I started doing research on kundalini awakenings. There have been so many crazy things going on in my life since the end of 2015 when my father passed away, and I've had a couple magical ""spiritual awakening"" journeys where I've felt like I'm getting somewhere, but I didn't realize that doing yoga could activate similar feelings. Then in doing today's practice I could really see how you plan all of these to fit together like a puzzle. Yesterday it was about thoughtfulness...paying attention to what was going on in the body, and today it was taking those ideas and focusing on making it all work together to serve your body as a whole. It's like learning vs applying what you learned. You give rest and work where you see fit, which is why this series works so well!   

I was drawn to your videos years ago, but wasn't ready to fully commit until this year, but even then... stuff has been really rough and I feel like until last night I didn't truly GET it. Even now I feel like it's just the beginning, but it's SO EXCITING I had to say something! Your authenticity and positivity is so refreshing. Your words move me every day, and get me through the hardest times where I feel like I can't even get out of bed and function at all. I love how you stress finding your own way, accepting and honoring where you're at today. If I miss a day, it affects my whole being...even my fiance notices! Girl, this is powerful stuff!

In past attempts I've gotten choked up and shed a few tears during certain practices, but today during the balancing segment where you said ""way to be human,"" tears just started flowing down my cheeks because I feel like I FINALLY understand. Or at least I'm starting to. I never realized that this would lead to something so valuable and precious... activating this hidden potential within. And it makes sense... this is what you've been trying to do all along, haven't you? I really hope that others watching your videos have felt something similar, because I really do feel like you have embraced what it truly means to be human, and you're doing such good work in attempting to spread that magic to the world. 

Even though this is through the internet, I consider you my guru, and this channel my shaktipat on the journey to fully awaken that hidden potential. I am so, so grateful that you exist and that I somehow have kept finding my way back to you. Everything is aligning!!! Thank you SO so much for continuing to create these videos and being so honest. You have changed my life, and clearly thousands of others. This truly is a revolution :) Namaste <3",UgyHQfSwD2cz6J_2PQ54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-08-19T18:43:31Z,0.6943749069602726

247.0,"Im on day 11 (obviously) and haven't skipped a day yet, this is huge for me every other work out program has been a battle to do more than three days in a row. I started because I was having panic attacks about 3 times a week and my medicine was at its max dosage before I would need a complete overhaul and change everything. So far it has been really easy to show up for myself.. until today. I put it off for as long as possible, it's now 11:18 pm and I have just had a grumpy day. My panic attacks have lessened I'm at like one a week now and that's great but I think because I'm ""better"" it's harder to justify getting out of bed and doing this workout. Im going to stick with it though. I made it through today without a inner smile but forced an outer smile. I feel a little less heavy but I'm still quite grumpy honestly. I also wanted to mention it has become my bedtime routine to do yoga, wash my face, take a shower, brush my teeth, get in my PJs and watch 1 30 minute episode of whatever. This is huge for me too because I have always been someone who gets home and eats dinner then gets in bed for the evening.

Just some constructive feedback: maybe it would help to work on giving instruction that allows people to follow along with you without watching the video. I know that sometimes it's impossible, but at some points, let us know where you're going and then guide us along with you as usual.

Example:

Instead of ""Drop your hands behind you, place them on the mat and roll into a sitting position.""

Maybe: ""We going to try to move into a sitting position with our backs on the floor and our knees pointed towards the sky so drop your hands behind you, place them on the mat and roll into a sitting position.""

Just a suggestion

While it is good to feel grounded and capable to cope with whatever life throws at you, it is also good to experience excitement, the unknown and let life bring you to a new place you didn't know you were headed to ‚ù§Ô∏è",UgiugtmpDCqrZngCoAEC,1.0,0.0,2017-03-15T13:37:52Z,0.9998414516448975

I've been practicing yoga with adriene for over almost two years now (whoa!) and I've enjoyed the journey of discovering my body BUT I always had a voice inside my head telling me that I was never going to be able to do a headstand, do the splits, get into THE perfect pose, that perfect shape.  I can't even begin to describe the amount of gratitude and love I am feeling after this video!
 as soon as it started and I realised that it was about realignment, it was like the universe was giving me a little nudge in the right  direction. Like ""yeah girl, you're on the right path today ;)"" .Towards the end I found myself focusing on my own progress within my OWN yoga journey. i took that sense of pride in myself  into savasana. No, I can't do the splits yet (lifting my leg up that high is a happy dream at the moment) but I find downward dog such a delicious resting posture. my heels touched the ground for the first time, and I found balancing on one leg to be so peaceful (which was very untrue last year). My body feels stronger, more flexible and my mind can find ease  with almost no effort. I don't usually comment but I found this all very inspiring and I wish I could tell myself a few years ago...and any other new yogis....that it's such a blessing to be  a beginner, standing on the precipice of discovering your own potential.

Also when I do an ab workout, when i lay on my left side to do side crunches in p90x it is much weaker and harder to do than when laying on my right. I have also noticed my right leg seems to be a little shorter than my right. If you can make a video to balance me out that would be great!!! when i put a book under my right foot my breathing becomes 2x better and deeper.

This makes me so happy. And I also used to have problems getting into Shavasana at the end of a yoga practice. It usually took me 5-10 minutes until I was able to really relax and now I just lie down and I'm instantly able to let my body and mind relax.

430.0,"Only eleven days of practicing and I feel different. Small, subtle, mostly undetectable by anyone other than I. But the difference is very much present. As am I, it's not frequent. It's not constant. Sometimes my observer is thrown into the tornado of my life situations. It goes missing for moments, but my observer always finds a way back. And I am endlessly thankful because deciding to show up here has made the moments of my observer longer and deeper. More intense. My mom has terrible lower back problems, and I have inherited them but there is still hope to guide them into a less painful future as I'm still young. I work as a barista so I'm on my feet a lot! I think I've gotten sciatica in my right leg. It flairs up sometimes, but the way I stand throughout my day and the thoughtfulness I put into it-directly affects it. I have less pain because of my practice. I have less pain because everyday for longer periods I am aware of me equally distributing my weight on either feet. I am aware of my balance and posture more and more every second. The practice on the mat DOES effect my every day practice off the mat and I am forever grateful to myself for showing up. Like another yogi friend said, it is no longer a chore. It feels damn good to show up and be here with you Adriene and everyone else! I am so thankful for you. As I grew up and became more spiritual and more conscious and aware of myself, I found yoga but felt it was a lost cause in the western world because of the financial weight of it. I thought, ""what if yoga is the tool to save someone, but they cannot afford it?"" (Expensive classes, retreats, etc) Fortunately, there are people like you that do offer those things but ALSO offer an array of videos free. And I know that's not always easy to offer free services for people. So I get it. But I am forever thankful that a cosmic dust created you and you are here, to create a healing practice with and for us. You are so appreciated!!

Last year I was just finding my footing with all of these different things, but then once I started to balance, I settled on the word focus, so that each day, everything I did had intention behind it. My room is clean, I meal prep and study during travel. These things help...but this, Adriene, this has been awesome. I'll have to figure out a new evening practice to commit to myself after this ends  on January 31st. I already meditate for an hour every morning, and that commitment is easy to keep with myself, but by evening I am usually quite scattered. This is setting the tone for my year with grounding and settled in the evenings, and I really, really like it.
