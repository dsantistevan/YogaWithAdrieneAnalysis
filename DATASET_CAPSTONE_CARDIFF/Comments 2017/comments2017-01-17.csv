I do not promote an unmedicated lifestyle for bipolar, I'm not alone in this as I will consult psychiatrists and psychologists (I'm one myself so it's helping too) all my life I think. But my energy is stable for years now and I know for sure yoga is one of the answer.

87.0,Very thankful and love your videos Adriene.  I've been practicing with you for 5 years and developed an appreciation and love of yoga.  However I got my first yoga injury from doing this video.  My arms got very tired from being held outstretched for an extended time but I ignored it.  Now my right shoulder has been hurting for over 2 weeks and it hurts to lift it up or move in certain ways.  I never realized how much we use our shoulders and arms.  I'm getting concerned and hope that with a few more weeks of light movement and rest it will heal on its own.  But just rewatching this it doesn't seem as if the outstretched arms part is that intense?  The injury happened on my second time cycling through these videos and I did not get injured the first time.  I will be more careful next time.  Lesson learned.  I wanted to share this experience so others may prevent this injury.  Thank you for your awesome videos.  You seem like a very kind and sweet person and you have changed my life for the better in a million ways.  Sending you love and respect.

99.0,I was really surprised how my body reacted to the one nostril breathing. It elicited an anxiety response in my body and I felt the same way I do when I start to have an anxiety attack. It was really interesting to think of anxiety as a somewhat physical reaction and not just a mental thing. It also really solidified for me the importance of breathing when experiencing anxiety.,UgyNlGTniwAKydpLV4Z4AaABAg,1.0,16.0,2019-12-23T22:14:52Z,0.9978405237197876

121.0,"I didn‚Äôt think it was possible for me to do the thumbnail pose but thought ‚Äûeh i will try it‚Äú and holy shit i did it. It was such a rush and made me giddy. 

I mean i wasn‚Äôt nearly as graceful as her but it worked in a plumb kinda way. 

I see changes in strength. I‚Äòm slowly working through all 30 day programs (not in year order though) and do feel a change in the strength of my arms. Also the hovering pose killed me in the beginning but now it got ‚Äûcomfortable‚Äú.

I can‚Äôt talk about my flexibility, because I was always flexible (but not sporty), since I always sat/laid in strange poses. But it was cool to learn that poses i do because they are comfy and stretchy are yoga üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è poses in origin. 

In general i started yoga because of my mental health. I have major depression and tried to kill myself a few months ago. After this, to make a new beginning, next to going to the doc, taking meds, going to therapy and other stuff to turn this around, I decided to give yoga a go. I love that adrien doesn‚Äôt focus on superficial aspects, but on the person itself. It sits well with me because I was always a ‚Äûfunctioning‚Äú and success oriented person and did everything without listening to what I need. How I felt was of no value to me and I never gave me breaks because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äûdeserve‚Äú them. It was enough that I functioned in all ‚Äûimportant‚Äú aspects. Now that I have to take a break to get better, which is incredible hard for me, it helps to keep the thinking/feeling aspects of the vids in mind. I would say I don‚Äôt necessarily feel mentally better through yoga yet, but it is a progress and things take time. I don‚Äôt feel worse through it though :)

153.0,"Stillness.... my mind usually races during being still, but I felt like I was floating there a bit during shavasana, lol. Nice. I‚Äôm really trying to keep this feeling throughout my quarter, now that school break is over. That building is filled with anxiety, and once I see it in one person, it‚Äôs like it transfers over to me. Today went well though. No anxiety, mostly calmness, and I practiced my deep breathing listening to the professor‚Äôs lecture. When I think about how hard this particular class is, I can feel the monster creep up, and then I breathe it away. It‚Äôs such a debilitating feeling, this anxiousness, so I recommend yoga practice to anyone struggling with anxiety. (I honestly recommend yoga for everything) It really helped me to stop looking at all possible threats, mistakes, Yada yada insert negative emotions here, and dial it back and put one foot in front of the other, breathe, and then the other foot. Wash, rinse, repeat. Before I knew it, I was on the other side of a challenge I thought was huge. Practicing everyday retrains your mind to get back to the peace you feel on the mat, love yourself, slow down and be in the moment, be kind to others, etc. it creeps in.

182.0,"I came to the mat after getting everything that would have filled my head out of the way first and so I came to the mat with an empty mind and I am happy to say, it remained that way through out today's practice.

I even pushed my limit by doing downward dog instead of the puppy version and so I got myself in a good frame of mind while I was concentrating on my breathing and my movements through out the session.

It was really good to start the session with the breathing exercise where we breathed through one nostril out and the other.  It was a nice way to soothe into the movements that followed and I really enjoyed it.  I was focused and willing to push myself to a new level mind, you, I didn't get as far as putting my feet over my head.  While this was happening, I had some stillness time, where I focused on my breathing and just be in the moment.  Like I said, I didn't have any thoughts cluttering the mind and because of this, I felt I was in a better place where I could be in the now and not thinking ahead to what needed to be done afterwards.

I am keep on saying I am so glad I found this path on my wellness journey as the 30 minutes gives me time to connect with myself and with the movement I find I am at a better place when I step off the mat and I look forward to the day, feeling a bit more energised than I did when I woke up.

The tiredness is still with me but with the gentleness of these movements and looking inward, I am finding I am getting through the afternoon with a bit more energy, but only once I start to slow down, do I realise that I had pushed myself to a limit, I didn't think was possible.",UgwOBHYhg5EruDK07qF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-12-09T04:20:52Z,0.9940229058265686

Probably because I didn't feel like I had the energy to do it and I've been working non stop at work lately. But I noticed that I'm combating this concept of laziness in my head. At the end of the practice today during savasana, I was totally hard on myself because I didn't hold the standing foot posture as long as I could have. And if I dig a little deeper into complex with lazy I noticed I will find that during my adolescence in my family I was always forced to perform beyond my limits. I now appreciate this fact in my life because it's the reason I am able to even come back to yoga mindfully and purposefully and give my all with every pose I do and with an awareness of where I'm at today. I noticed that me not accepting myself at my worst has been a condition of others not accepting me at my worse.

212.0,"Dear Adriene,
I would like to thank you for changing my life. Half a year ago I started to have health issues. I had headaches in the morning and lower energy during the day with ups and downs from day to day. Because I had to stop jogging every other day, I searched for something else to stay fit and ran into your 30 days of yoga practice. Soon I found out that I really enjoyed doing yoga and I really liked your 'low-key' and loose way of teaching. In the past I thought that yoga was a very spiritual happening and that's why I never started doing it, but you showed me that yoga is fun and a good workout too! I think I did about 45 of your video's and started doing sessions on my own, without a laptop, and I am fitter than ever before. I feel in shape, strong, sexy and very stretchy :).
I am a touring artist and getting these health issues (which are still being investigated), I was afraid I would not be able to handle the sometimes tough life on the road. Lot's of airplanes, different timezones and of course the shows. It's been going very well and I think I will never stop doing Yoga. Again, I want to thank you for showing me that yoga is fun, helps me to be and stay in shape, clears my mind and is something I really look forward to every day! Keep up the good work and I'll pm you whenever we play a show in Austin :).
Love and Peace, Leon",UgxMJ8gkgNiIUbD-7aR4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2017-08-12T12:43:45Z,0.9995550513267517

327.0,"I have been practicing yoga for about 7 months, and this program has been a little more challenging than what I started with, mentally as much as physically. But I have been having some issues lately with my abdominal muscles. I don't understand what the problem is and it is very frustrating to me. It's as if there is a catch in my upper left abdominal muscle around my rib cage. I feel a discomfort/pressure there when I breathe and when I do poses.It goes from my rib cage area  and a little to my hip, like there is an air pocket in there or something. My right side is fine and can contract the way it is supposed to no problem, but my left side struggles to connect almost it feels like, and I have to focus a lot to keep it the way it is supposed to be, sometimes the muscle will jump/catch/move and that causes discomfort but then it feels like it is where it is supposed to be. I don't know what the problem is but it is causing me so much frustration. This practice means so much to me and I feel like I am not able to perform at my best because I am held back by this discomfort. It is something I have noticed my whole life but is just subtle, but since the last like 4 practices it has become a lot more noticeable, I think maybe because my abdominal muscles are becoming stronger than they've ever been and are working harder and I am more aware of them. It is making me very upset and discouraged. At the beginning of the program I was working out my abs and I felt very strong and stable, now because of this I feel weak there and not supported and very frustrated and discouraged. Could I maybe have injured myself or something? Maybe I just need some tips on what I should conceptualize regarding my abs. I know squeezing lower ribs in and belly button to spine. But maybe I need to reevaluate how I work with my abs, I might be causing the discomfort through errors in working them out.

This happens to me in certain poses and am unsure if it's a sign that my body is working towards improvement or a sign to soften the pose and not push as hard. Can you provide some feedback on that?

453.0,"Dear Adriene,

I found your channel after having been off the mat for the better part of a year+. I had to stop running suddenly (scooting forward awkwardly in my case) when my orthotics gave out. Until that point, I'd done multi-level yoga once a week at the gym. For whatever reason, most likely shame, I didn't want to continue at the gym so I scanned youtube for help. I found your channel, and binged on your videos almost daily for about 3 weeks straight. I've continued to practice a few times a week at home since then. #yogarevolution is my first yoga challenge, and I can slid into it almost as an after thought, but I'm on the mat every day.

Anyway, today is my birthday and your Day 17 practice was an excellent fit. Also, in honor of a promise to myself to cultivate community and be visible, I have subscribed to your channel (finally/first subscription ever) and posted this comment. This year is mine to ""find what feels good"" as you like to say. Thank you for providing a platform for me and others to do that.
