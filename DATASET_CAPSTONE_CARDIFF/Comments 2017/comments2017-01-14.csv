The violence and racial injustices barreling down my neighborhood and in our our nation is beyond measure. For a moment.

I am just saying there's a revolution in my mind, body and neighborhood and it's helped today to find a way to use this forgiveness toward meaningful living.

This is a tough regimen that definitely pushes me to my limits.  My favorite thing about Yoga is how it is more about life than a workout.  When we are trying too hard, we aren't listening to our bodies.  I may not be able to do every pose listed, but I am challenged to listen to my body and honor it, which is where Adriene and other yogis tell us truth growth happens.

It depends so much on how I'm feeling in the moment, in the day, and you have to do what is right for that day.

151.0,"With a scheduled appointment, I was hoping to be able to switch on the yoga early in the morning but it didn't happen, but as soon as I got home, I had the tv switched and ready to go and I am glad I did.  I always find I am put in a better frame of mind and having this one routine at the start of the day is beneficial too because I always feel better at the end.

Today didn't feel like anything we have done over the past two weeks and each day is always refreshing.  Yesterday, I started doing an at home resistance workout including squats and this morning, I am feeling the work out, so starting with the massage on the legs, was the best start to today's session, although I did not concentrate solely on the calf and ankle regions.  

I am finally getting to be in the present when I come to the mat, and listening to Adriene guide me through the session really puts me in a better place because I am tuned into what she is talking about and focusing on my actions on the mat and not caring about what is happening in my life at the moment.  I really liked the way the day started off with the cat/cow in a sitting position.  I found it to be a great way to start instead of being in a table top position.  

I found today's stretching really beneficial and I did find that over the short period of time, my thighs were not as sore as they were when I started the class for the day.  I am still not flexible but I do know I have good balance but for some unknown reason I wasn't well balanced when it came to today's leg work out.  Usually I am really well balanced and can stand up for awhile but today, something was a bit off.

As for tomorrow, I will be on the mat early and I look forward to the challenge ahead.",Ugx4_0ISkdEgZ0rE-tp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2017-12-06T09:30:21Z,0.9968156218528748
152.0,"Another check-in, this week has actually been a little harder than the previous ones, which has helped with my hip alignment and when I'm walking around getting errands done I can tell my steps are more connected and balanced! I normally favor a bit on my left side and even when I sit in chairs I notice i always kinda lean on that left hip. I'm working on it and this week has been killer on my upper thighs and hips which is nice to have a bit more of a challenge and I notice my body is slowly starting to even out with each day. :D I'm still going hard at it and doing about 1.5 hours a day if I have the time. I love that whatever I might be struggling with, I can target those areas with your videos and work on that strength while still getting my daily video done as well. (I learned my lesson last time when I worked my core and abs last week at the gym then got home to do the daily video and that day was all abs as well.

Im not very traditional orthodox, but this one i like a lot, and how symbolic is this this contemporaneity with todays practice! Its going to make this day even more shining.

476.0,"Hi Adriene, 

I love your videos. Thank you for making them.  I used to take yoga classes but they got too expensive. So this is a great free online resource. I suggested this to a friend but as a person of faith (as am I but I focus on prayer when we have to meditate), she is a bit concerned of the spiritual side of yoga that conflicts with her beliefs and is thus apprehensive for doing yoga even though she sees the health benefits,  is it possible to do yoga without the philosophy and just the exercises do you think? Or does it eliminate the effect of relaxing,  rest, mindfulness and release? Interested to hear your thoughts on this or even a talk video, for people who want to do yoga but have specific beliefs. I'm a Child and Youth Care counselor and I think it'd be a great thing for clients who have anger or anxiety to do to give grace and let go. But some as well do have conflicting beliefs with yoga spiritual practices. What do you think about this or what can be done? I hope you see this!

513.0,"This was the most challenging practice for me so far! Despite practicing yoga for about a year now, my hamstrings are thight as hell. Straightening front leg in pyramid pose? It hurts so badly! I keep it slightly bent but I feel that way I'm not getting the full benefits of this posture.",UgjFrKzp-nkheXgCoAEC,8.0,89.0,2017-01-14T08:47:54Z,-0.9965354204177856

515.0,"This was absolutely the perfect session for me today, I could have cried with relief when I read the 'stretching sore muscles' bit!  Why?  Because we're having a bit of wintry weather up here on the north coast of Scotland and at 2am yesterday morning my hay barn roof blew off, ending up in a neighbour's field, cutting off the power to the north end of the village when it bounced off an electricity cable and leaving all my winter hay exposed to the elements.  As you can imagine, yesterday was a long and physical day and I could barely move when I got up this morning, but this has loosened me off nicely.  Thank you :)",Ugj2S7uzi15n03gCoAEC,4.0,121.0,2017-01-14T08:15:40Z,0.9944118857383728
516.0,"Hi Adriene,
Dunno how much of your comments you get to read, but if you're reading this thank you so much. It goes on a bit longer than this, so if you want to stop now, that's okay!

I've been doing yoga with for quite a while now and at the beginning I was very frustrated (still am with some balancing poses!) and I wasn't practising self-care. I squeezed and manipulated my body into those positions. But now, I'm okay. It's sometimes frustrating if I can't get a posture, but I let myself do the 'easier' version (before I would head for the hard ones that were meant for more practiced yogis straight away!) 

So, all in all, I thought I'd really got this self care down.

But then you invited us to recognise our thoughts at the beginning. And I realised I'm STILL not practising self care. It's not early here - I started at 7amish - but I went out for about four hours yesterday. For most people, that would be nothing, but I suffer from pretty extreme anxiety and had a panic attack. Yet, dang it - I was gonna do my practice at the same time, course I was! What would have kinder to do to myself is stay in bed a little longer, read my book and recognise that I am worn out. It's a whole body thing.

So, I forgive myself for panicking at some school children yesterday. And I forgive myself for making the wrong call today. It's okay to get things wrong. This was a very moving practice to me.

Anyway, dunno if you're even reading this (!), but I hope that you get to read some of your comments, and just a thank you for helping me realise that self-care goes beyond the yoga mat. Although I really can't massage myself!

Much love,

Ellen

PS I'm getting the emails about each day's practice two days late - can this be changed? Or can one of our lovely group of Adrienes somehow email it to me on the right day? It's very frustrating. I dunno how that could happen without one of showing our email addresses... anyway, see what happens.

Namaste.",Ugh1FzuqhfOXBngCoAEC,7.0,72.0,2017-01-14T07:59:48Z,-0.9665309190750122
