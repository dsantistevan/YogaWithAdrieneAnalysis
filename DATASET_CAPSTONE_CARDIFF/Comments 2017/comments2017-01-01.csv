I‚Äôm am finally in the normal range! But I practically felt like my circulation was improving with the 30 days as the inversions(?) Stopped making me feel dizzy or headachy.

Really committing to my yoga practice is something really important to me that I want to focus the next month on. I am often frustrated with myself because I really struggle with discipline and consistency in all areas of my life. I really and truly want to improve in this way, and I am starting with yoga. I am hoping that it will spill over into other areas of my life.

366.0,"Adriene, thank you again for doing what you do. A couple of months ago, your videos got me into a routine of yoga and a body transformation where for the first time in my life I was exercising regularly and getting fit in a healthy way. I was gaining muscle and feeling lean and strong and confident. It started to decline when I worked overnight shifts for two weeks straight due to understaffing at work. It got really bad after a month in Europe (not that that's something to complain about!), but my routine, diet, fitness were all totally thrown off. After returning, I went to an uncomfortable environment and did not properly care for myself especially when I should have paid attention to my sensitivity to jetlag. I have been dehydrated, depressed, overeating, fatigued, and feeling terrible about my weight gain for the past two weeks. Today I wanted to slowly ease back into exercise, starting with yoga. I first searched for new videos, because I knew I was so familiar with yours, I figured something new was needed. But I found that you made a new series, I thought that would be good to follow. Played this video and your voice and method and reassurances made me feel so good and hopeful...I'm just so grateful to have your videos for guidance and I'm so excited to know where to turn when I need healing or change.

I've recently started practicing yoga. I have some question about yoga mats. First, do you need a mat at all? Right now I'm simply using my living room rug and I do find myself slipping at times so what would be a good mat to get? Last, What size should I get?

544.0,"I'm starting this today, I finished yoga camp yesterday and 30days before that. Yesterday was hard for me. I was getting frustrated in the simple poses and questioning my daily commitment. 

Backstory, I have a fully torn ACL and a tear in my meniscus, an injury that forced me to retire 3 years ago from the only physical exercise I ever wanted to do. Roller Derby. Long story short, after 3years of no activity, I found this channel in May and I've been GLOWING since. 

Back to yesterday, I was upset. Maybe it was the silence of the last day, maybe I wasn't mentally there. I don't know but I fought against the practice. I didn't stop, I QUIT. I quit thinking about how I was letting myself down and told myself it was just an off day, but I wasn't fully convinced. THEN IT HAPPENED! Adriene moved into crow pose. Crow is the difficult pose I've chosen to work towards. and I DID IT! I didn't even try that hard, my body did the work. I almost cried but instead let out a squeak of pure joy. And then fell over.

I'm here now 24(ish) hours later. I'm ready to revolt against my negative thoughts and I can't wait to see when I am in another 30days.  

THANK YOU ADRIENE!!!!!!!!!

I started with your Yoga for Weight Loss Total Body Workout a week back. And I am LOVING IT! It's the first time in my life that I've got a workout routine that I actually look forward to each morning. And I think that's because the you put the emphasis on the process, the mind-body connection and the commitment to the body; rather than losing weight or getting in shape. The fact that you focus on the process, instead of the target, is just so great!

I started following your yoga routine with the initial intention of shaping up; and I find that I have chanced upon something that's giving me so much more! In just a week, I can consciously appreciate the fact that I am less stressed, more mindful of myself and everything around me, able to better concentrate and focus and much less lethargic.

my name is jonas, i am a 27 year old guy from denmark. and you helped me alot! thanks!:D
you see, the past year for mee has bein plagued by a lot of injurys.  i had to stop working out, stop running. and by the end i had to even stop walking other than what was necessary.
i had about 30-50 trips to massages, kiropraktors, doctors, and everything inbetween.
you see i was desperate, and if i am being honest a bit depressed :( 
then i saw you here on youtube, and i followed your first beginners video.
the nekst day, i kinda felt looser in my body. i wasent compensating in my walk for whatever pain i felt in my injurys.
well not as mutch annyways. i still felt pain, but in a diferent way, it¬¥s hard to explain.
but come hell or high whater, i was gonna do that video again.
now after maby 10 videos or somthing like that i am almoast pain free. 
and i just committed my self to your 30 day practis.
i am so mutch better now because of you.
i guess i just wanted to say thank you :D so yeah Thank you Adriene <3

888.0,"THANK YOU SO MUCH, Adriene!! I have always wanted to get into yoga, but have always had a difficult time doing so. I am more interested in the spiritual aspects of it, and it seems so many are concerned with using it for exercise. I truly appreciate how often you remind us to breathe and pay attention to our bodies! And I can't tell you how much I appreciate your sense of humor! THAT makes me want to ""come back""!! Thanks to you, I now look forward to my daily yoga time!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!! 

For those of you in the community and on this thread, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ALL OF THE REVOLUTION VIDEOS!!!  Just go to 
https://gumroad.com/l/yoga-revolution

This is also a way we can give back to Adriene (No I am not advertising, I don't even know her personally). I just found this today! It asks for a donation of.. ready for this? $1.00!  Seriously! Again, THANK YOU Adriene!! 

SO if you have the ability to give more, It would be SO awesome if we try and give as much back to her, in appreciation, as she has given to us!! (again, I emphasize, I'm not affiliated with Adriene at ALL! I just believe in giving back to those who give so much for FREE! Contrary to what many people believe, the income she gets is most likely not even close to what she spends in time and money to make the videos. I looked it up and found this article. It's from 2014, but I'm sure the numbers are still close to being the same.
http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-youtube-stars-actually-make-2014-2

SO LET's SHOW HER HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE HER!!! By giving more than a dollar! Even if we all give a mere 5 bucks (and yes, that's a struggle for me as well at this time) I'm sure we can give her as much as she has given, in time, for us. Maybe. Let's try! :)

And I just HAVE to say again, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU Adriene!!!!!  Namaste!!!

902.0,"Today i've started the first day of Revolution and i suddenly felt really emotional... I realised how much this has helped me since i started, yesterday i finished 30 days of yoga, which i found last year in your channel after trying yoga for weight loss and failing so i started the challenge to get a little bit stronger and be able to do the weight loss practice and not die. To be honest, i couldn't finish 30 days of yoga in 30 days, when i started it i was emotionally in a really bad place, i was a horrible mess and even though i liked it, i didn't have the will to do things every day so i skipped days and had to start all over again, i used to have a lot of anxiety and eat junk food because of that. As the days passed i realised that each day i was skipping less and less and that i was doing the exercises a little less anxious and a little more calm and aware. Yoga has tamed my anxiety and now my mind is so much more clear and healthy and because of that, my body is much healthier too, i stopped eating junk food because my anixiety has been dimmed down, and lost weight, that even though was my initial goal i don't really care about it now, because i'm happy.

1024.0,"I came here after just finishing Yoga Camp. If you're thinking about starting this - DO IT! I suffered from anxiety for years and still now a little bit, but something about Yoga Camp and following the mantras, focusing on the positive, and on the self has really really  helped me. I feel like I am more in control of my thoughts which were the detriment to me in the past. I think that even just taking a break from the ""thinking mind"" like Adriene says, even for a few minutes a day really does make such a difference. Physically I feel like I have better posture too. I think we focus too much on trying to better our psychical bodies, trying to use yoga to tone and slim down but I think the mind is what gets neglected. But we use our minds more than we do our bodies so doesn't it make sense to exercise the mind too?

Besides going outside (which isn't all that easy or enjoyable in the winter) your videos are often the most immediate relief I can find when I get into bad head spaces..

Really good choice of word, I enjoy learning with you, looking forward to the next 30 days :) 

Sukha (Sanskrit, Pali; Devanagari: ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ñ) means happiness, pleasure, ease, or bliss, in Sanskrit and Pali. Among the early scriptures, 'sukha' is set up as a contrast to 'preya' (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Ø) meaning a transient pleasure, whereas the pleasure of 'sukha' has an authentic state happiness within a being that is lasting. In the PƒÅli Canon, the term is used in the context of describing laic pursuits, meditative absorptions, and intra-psychic phenomena",UggEp7lyTh4j0XgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-01-01T20:30:55Z,0.9997909665107727
