0.0,"This session continues to help us learn about the philosophy of yoga too.  

For example, snuggling up to the role of the observer has changed my whole life. 

Off the mat, this practice has allowed me to pause more, and notice my reaction before  I make a choice on how I want to consciously react to that emotional response. This has helped me to be a better listener, to move with more mindfulness, and to act with greater intention and purpose.",UgyL5OR-wHaVRQzBgr14AaABAg,48.0,1144.0,2021-01-09T14:18:54Z,0.9541642069816589

29.0,"I remember starting this series at the beginning of the year and not finishing it just like the years before. I've been struggling with lots of mental issues like anxiety, depression, and ptsd for all my life and there was a time yoga brought me peace. But I was 17 and stronger and more limber. Restarting yoga now in my late 20s- early 30s feels like such a struggle because I keep looking back to the younger me that could do this stuff no problem and that always made me feel bad. But your videos have really helped me to stay kind to myself during the practice and to be patient with myself and with my growth. 

I ended up quitting my job and taking a year off to learn to love myself and discover what I truly like and what I want in life and I decided to do one yoga video every day. So far I've been doing great with it, coming to the practice even when I'm tired or having a bad mental day. I think this time I can do the whole thing.

It's a long way of saying that I struggle a lot--to do things, to love myself, to treat myself well, to exist--but somehow these practices with you make it easier and teach me to be better to myself also. So thank you for posting these videos and all videos you've posted already too. You're a tremendous help for me, and for people like me too, I'm sure.

 Thank you so much.",UgytDmHD0zmVwMDmdop4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-10-10T04:43:41Z,0.9966524243354797

I still feel like I'm too stiff for some the exercises (when Adriene had her legs crossed and went to the forearms I couldn't even cross my legs properly), but I'm showing up and doing the best I can.

309.0,"I don't know about anyone else, but the practice today made me very emotional, especially at the end, laying down. I started to tear up when I realized that I could -and I hope this doesn't sound silly- snuggle up to myself, my soul. And feel held by myself. So often in my life I've been looking for someone else to cuddle me and hold me and make me feel safe. After this Leo full moon I told myself I was going to let go of the need for someone else to make me feel safe, and create it myself. And here I am, laying on my mat all alone-feeling like an infant held by their mother but it's all me.

He puts his head up my shirt duing downward dog and plank. He gets in my lap during lotus and twists etc. He nudges me hard for attention during savasana. I think I need to keep him in the other room. Then he flops out relaxed when we are done.

I'm not a religious or spiritual person in any way (no 3rd eye for me), meditation makes me anxious and angry and, physically, I could be the worst person at yoga ever (I'm over 50, I'm overweight, my heels have never touched the ground in downward dog, I swear my arms are too short as I can't even wrap them around my knees when on my back, I have arthritis in both knees and one thumb, and the only ""crow"" that will ever be in my life is the crow that I eat!) BUT I am so thankful for Adriene and these series as I can do them in the privacy of my own home and she never makes me feel like a yoga loser for what I can't do.  I've learned not to focus on what I can't do but to modify for what I can and at the end of every session, I find that I have improved, even if in the tiniest bit, in some form - breathing, flexibility, balance - SOMETHING.   By the end of a 30 day session (which honestly may take me 32-35 days) I feel better in my body and mind.  All of this to say, even if you don't think yoga is for you or that you can't do it...you CAN.

635.0,"Day 8:

It says some things about me that I waded through the first week of practice, in spite of aching muscles and poses I'd never seen before, and kept up every single day, and it's this kind self-care practice that I put off for an entire day instead.

It's been a long, hard, strange, terrible week, and I am being kind to myself this weekend.  I'm glad to have had this.  I'm glad to have brought myself to do it.  I knew it would be warm and good and feel good to do, and I let it slide away for a day and a half because, well, I didn't need to push myself and force myself to do something that felt GOOD, did I?  I only got myself to the mat by reminding myself that I wouldn't feel able to do the hard, important things if I didn't get through this nice one first.

The nice things are important too.  This was worth my time, not just as a necessary unskippable step in the thirty days, but on its own merit.  I'm glad to have done it.

Everyone else was on Day 9 today, but I'll do Day 9 tomorrow, and if I stay a day behind for the rest of the month so be it.  I'm still not alone.  Thousands of people are a day behind, or two days, or three.  Thousands of people will find this sequence in the future, next week or next month or next year, and it will still be worth it.

669.0,Such a lovely practice today. And what a difference it makes to be breathing correctly--inhaling down and exhaling up and out. I've practiced yoga for years and don't think I really understood that until this week. I could feel each posture being that much more beneficial just by proper breathing.

In every breathtake.
There is a endless horizon
And the time flies so fast.

Thoughts are like a rainfall.
Inside me, there is snow.

Fume widens my senses.
Thoughts fly far.
There is a swirling falling of snowflakes in the wind. 
But time stands still now.

My breath carries me and opens a thousand doors.
My world is revived in this moment,
I can feel it with all my senses.
Since the light of life shines in me.

I thank this glimmer of hope, I trust this power.
That makes me believe in myself
And what glories; to the whole world:
Creates deep connections.

Something about the way she phrases the benefits (snuggling up, comforting, deep relaxing) of these poses just triggers me into frustration and anger because I physically can't do these moves.
