163.0,"So I took a two-day rest because I was feeling knackered and sore. And the title ""strength"" scared me a little. But now I'm back! And I'm feeling a little silly, seeing it wasn't as bad as it was in my mind. Plus, I'm seeing day 20 is ""pause"", so if I had done this yesterday, I would have had my ""pause"" anyway. Here struggling to let go and not be a perfectionist, as you can see... 
Anyway, I'm really trying to master my breath. I've seen lately in so many sites that breathing in the chest is really bad, and we should all try to breath through the belly. Exactly like Adriene teaches. Mykie, from Glam and Gore (makeup Youtube chanel) is having serious health issues just because she breathes in the chest instead of the diaphragm. So I'm really trying to pay attention to it and be conscious.

232.0,"I love how I'm noticing strength building up as I show up to the mat 5x per week (I'm kinda taking the weekends off) my experience today in doing this yoga session proved to me even more that I'm so much stronger compared to when I first started!

Quick story: I started practicing yoga last 2018 (with Adriene's 30 Day Yoga Challenge) and practiced regularly until last year. So like I haven't practiced yoga regularly for a year or so, then I started with BREATH on January 12, 2021 where I found my limbs and muscles shaking even when simply in downward facing dog. At first, it was discouraging, but I followed Adriene's advice to follow my breath throughout the practice and focused on how I feel and what my breath is telling me. So one day at a time, I started to build up my foundations again and really enjoy the journey. I'm very happy with where I am today, and I commit to really integrate yoga in my lifestyle even after completing the BREATH journey in a few days from now. ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§ç",UgwRkkMuyf2GKTEfDy14AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2021-02-04T10:49:18Z,0.9993595480918884

Day  19 of the journey

Together with Aidlin and Benji, I trained my body and mind to be aware of my breathing.
I could feel the supple strength in me more than usual.

Even when I got off the mat, I tried to rift my chest and breathe with confidence( as I tend to lose confidence).

I hope that the strength you all have will help you. 
Thank you.

Although my body feels as weak as it's ever been today, I learnt so much about strength. Moving super slowly and doing the practices in the smallest gentlest way instead of 'hitting the pose' taught me so much about self-kindness. Even mountain pose and corpse pose felt a bit much to hold at times, so slow gentle modifications were essential. The stillness at the end and gentle pace helped me learn that strength isn't all about speed and aggression, but willingness to show up even when 'failure' is likely and you feel far behind what seems like 'everyone else' in the journey.

For example, today at the end she talks about the importance of recognising that we fail, that we are humans, and about how we need to stop, breath, focus, and try again sometimes.

I did yesterday's practice today by the morning, not yesterday (PMS is kicking my ash this week), but I was feeling so low and frustrated with myself that I couldn't focus. At half of the practice I just gave up at the half of every pose, and wasn't able to concentrate on anything that I was doing. 

I ended the practice feeling really really bad. But then I focused on my breath, on my center, and tried everything again.
And I did it. Not perfectly, but did it. And then today she talks about failing and trying again. üíï

1002.0,"I've never commented before, but just had to say this course has been amazing for me. I have a severe disability - multiple herniated discs in my lower back and neck, even after several surgeries to fuse a few of them. COVID shut down the pain clinic here where I received monthly injections, and as a result I ended up bent over and unable to straighten my back. I thought I might be stuck this way forever. I tried exercising on my own but without guidance or motivation I just ended up hurting myself more. I joined this challenge as several of my friends were doing it, and even though I can't hit many of the poses (Cobra is far out of my reach!) I have modified as necessary and done the best I could. This is the FIRST yoga practice that has moved slowly enough, with good transitions, encouraging modifications and listening, and on day 8 I noticed a strength I hadn't felt in several years. The instructions are excellent, this is the first yoga I've done in my life that didn't kill my wrists! I still cannot stand up straight, but I am a tiny bit straighter, and that is HUGE for me. Thank you Adriene for yoga that is accepting and loving and allowing EVERYONE a place. I am already planning to do another thirty day course when this is over, I believe I have found my way back from living the rest of my life bent over and getting more and more disabled as a result. I now have a target to be standing upright within six months! I didn't know it was possible, and now I believe it is.

You've got the strength to be there for your son."" It was like you were talking to me personally, like you'd made the video just for me to raise me up.

This is a reoccurring pain I get in the front of my shoulder and in my armpit.  It doesn't hurt when I am doing yoga but afterwards it burns and can become quite unbearable. I just wondered if you might have some insight to help me breath and move into a healing space here.  I have a very stiff body and flexibility is a challenge for me.

I'm on my period today and I was already afraid of that day because I still wanted to keep going with this 30 day yoga journey.

I'm gonna listen to my body and just do my best. No expectations."" And guess what? Today I needed less breaks than on ""normal"" days! Cause I always expect that I need to do it as good as Adriene - even though she always says it's okay if we're not where she is. And it totally is. But my brain keeps telling me lies.
