Normally I hesitate to bend forward in staff pose because I get a pain under my right shoulder blade...

But today for some reason‚ÄîI leaned into the pain, focused all my attention on that spot & stretched FURTHER... And it was like I BREATHED OUT the pain!! Then my entire spine clicked & released this HUGE amount of energy. It was so intense a wave of nausea swept over me and I started sweating. But as long as I held the pose‚Äîthe energy just kept flowing out through the entire length of my spine! It was unreal and I feel incredible!!

198.0,"‚ÄúThe love and attention we seek is actually within.‚Äù

Most nights, I spend time thinking about how I am not loved by my friends the way I wanted to be loved. I long for the same things I do for them - random text messages, small piece of chocolates, or even just a five-minute talk about our lives. I always go to the loop of how I always initiate, I always give, I always care for and how the acts of love I give isn‚Äôt the same with what I get. Today, I realized I can do the things I do for others, for myself. I can spend time with just hanging around, listening to music, drawing and writing, buying my favorite candy, and giving myself the kind words I always seek from others. 

I remember a quote I come across, non-verbatim but it sounded like ‚ÄúTalk to yourself as if you were your hurting friend.‚Äù If we can‚Äôt receive it from others, might as well give it to ourselves. No one is going to love us more than ourselves because we know ourselves inside out.

In the end I decided to go to bed and snuggle in as a burrito.

294.0,"Day 25:

You know, I wasn't going to practice today.

I've gotten kinder and more understanding with myself when I miss days, and I've been pretty consistent for the past several.  I woke up stiff all over, and managed to stretch a terrible crick _into_ my back and shoulder, rather than out of it.  Rounding my back twinged like a bad neck  from sleeping upright in a chair.  A few experimental cat-cows, just to try and loosen it up, _hurt_.

But it was the kind of hurt that felt like stretching and loosening up would help instead of make it worse, and I'm better at listening to my body now than I was a month ago, and I could tell the difference.  And I did a bit of stretching, and the easiest thing seemed to be to go for some of the stretches we've done together in practice, some of the things I'd learned from Adriene, because after all, I know them now, right?  And then five or ten minutes later, after I'd decided to skip today entirely, I was in tabletop position moving into a twist and I thought to myself, _you know, if we're down here already anyway, we might as well at least see what the day's practice is._

And there it was, exactly what I needed.  For my body, which hurts more than I wish it did at my age, and can't bend or lift or move the way I want it to, but which _does_ bend and lift and feel and work as hard as it can, which has always done its best for me while I've tried to do my best for myself.  For my heart.

Today was a good day.",Ugy6lP2p4HB9E7jRxRt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-07T20:02:04Z,-0.812727153301239

I love watching the sunshine through the window in your studio where you are currently shooting this 30 day journey, watching Benji looking out for the deer, birds and the wind in the grass. It is all so relaxing, and sometimes I can't keep my eyes shut because I just want to reach out and stroke Benji. This particular practice was one of those special ones. I closed my eyes at the end and really understood for a brief moment  about the difference between love and what I thought was love, but was really empathy and compassion. Love is different and that moment truly resonated with me. Then I looked up to see that Benji had sat on you in your burrito blanket! I had to rewind to see that it was just at that precise moment  Benji had decided to sit on you to show you his true love.

I hope I finish the month strong, and to anyone else struggling right, you‚Äôre not alone.

I think I am going to cry all along with the practice because I think that my body needs it, but isn't it self-love? To let my body free itself from the worries and just reset and love itself as it is now, a little bit broken and tired. Thank you, Adriene!  Thanks to you and these 10 months of practice I learned what it was to just feel, breathe and allow myself to love my body and my mind as they are, beautiful and unique in their own ways.

Once we got going in the practice, horsey lips caused her to sit up and take notice, she shifted around to watch the video, then observe me as if comparing. For savasana, she curled up nestled in my arm. I really felt the love!

It goes away in a neutral position but will come again in any other pose, even over one or two hours. I almost couldn‚Äôt do the poses where the tops of the feet lay on the mat because of the pain.

I had an amazing, charismatic cat called Bodhi that was my yoga partner for years like Benji is for you. When he passed a couple of years ago, it was a loss greater than anyone could imagine. I literally felt my root chakra dim - and started to limp because the left side (heart side lost it's anchor)  - but have got stronger in my practice as a result since I dedicate and summon his connection daily. Your crown chakra and heart chakra and 'hands' can be a portal to that energy...and just saying his name grounds me. I have seen your practice and  I know you will be fine in the event of....and your body will guide you through. I am only writing this because it looks like you have a lot of followers and are helping alot of people, so wanted to make sure you have a bit of advice that may help you, when and if you need it.

1226.0,"Growing up I had a very tough relationship with my body, it was all hate and no love. It was definitely conditioned by how my body never fit any canon of modern beauty and fit, the pressure I felt to be liked by my peers for what I looked like crushed me many times and so did the evil comments of young and adults alike. I started doing yoga daily more than a year ago ( a bit later with Adriene) and in this period of time, I felt the biggest change in my mindset. My body got more flexible and a bit stronger, without changing my weight or shape. But the biggest change happened in my mind when I finally learnt to love myself for who I am and started to let go of society imposed beauty canons. It's been a long and awaited journey but I'm glad I can finally be able to appreciate (most of the times) what my body does for me and how it looks like, too.",UgxPDyntPv1Q1imWnhh4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2021-01-26T12:15:45Z,0.9955039620399475

But I think I'll just do one of the previous breath days :) I'm so glad I joined the 30 day journey this time. My goal in the beginning was to show up for myself without the focus being fitness, changing my body, losing weight or comparing myself to anyone. I just wanted a sole dedication of showing up every day no matter what - a habit. And I feel like it's really happening, it is becoming a habit. 3 days ago I stopped eating sugary stuff but it felt natural without an ounce of force, I suppose change can be gradual :) I love this community and I can't wait to see what's next.
