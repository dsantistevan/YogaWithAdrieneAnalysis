23.0,"when I was doing this practice more than year ago, I was struggling so hard, I was in pain, and felt angry, because I couldn't understand how this practice can be so hard for somebody who was doing yoga for almost a year. I think it was the first time I couldn't breath breathing.  

but today I came back, and it was the most satisfying experience that I ever had. I felt good, I found a right way to place my arms, I was aware of mine breath. 

now I understand that the problem was never in this practice. a problem was in me living in a toxic household, being surrounded by anxiety and fears. through this year so much changed, I changed SO MUCH in myself, that this practice turned out to be the biggest inspiration to never give up.  

I am here, breathing, okay. I want to direct my ""Thank you"" to Adriene since her work means so much even after all this time.",UgxqVi7R_mbmB-qaByF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-11-25T17:31:38Z,0.9995960593223572

I couldn't take a full breath without coughing even over a year later.

My foot started going numb and at the end when I brought my hands together I was surprised at how cold they were even though I was doing this practice outside in the sun. I will say I've always struggled with slow inward breaths (slow exhales have always been ok tho) and today it finally clicked and I was able to tap into some very slow inhales! I still had room even after the 8 count!

95.0,"This is June 2021. I started this 30 day practice with a fizzle and then because I noticed that for the first time doing yoga I felt like I 'got the connection' finally because of how Adriene explains everything so organically. I love it. Since starting, even on the days of having very little sleep, I looked forward to getting myself onto my mat first thing everyday. I have never done anything like that EVER! A crazy busy time right now (exhausted) and a spasming hamstring, I did have to take a few days off to honour my body. It just felt like the right thing to do. Now today, back on track and all the busyness has abated so I am super excited to carry on with Adriene. Her 'way' has shown me a whole new way with yoga that I have never experienced before and I am connecting with my body in such a beautiful way. I love it/ I can't thank you enough Adriene for being here and committing to helping humanity in this amazing way that you do.

517.0,I'm always a bit slow. Last year I was 6 days behind this year only 4. Progress is progress but today I was dreading practicing thinking I'm so sore and tired so it was great to know this was a day of the breath. But how much more challenging it is than the movement. Sometimes I still get stuck on holding poses and forgetting to breath. I have asthma so it is so hard to breath already but I managed to survive to 7 count with a bit of struggling the 8 count I tried but went as far as 6 count by the 2nd attempt. But I'm happy I managed to get as far as I could wow.

i thought maybe y'all would like to read it, so here's the first bit:

the tension melts from my shoulders as
the wind tickling through the long grass
plays with my hair
 my eyes close but for a moment

the sky elongates above me
as though i'm in a snowglobe
encased lovingly with silence
and floating sparkling fireflies

 gentle brushing blades of grass
bending to touch my ankles
letting go after a quick hello
they return to their places

the only sounds that reach me
my slow breath, the softest song
a personal ocean crashes with grace
and retreats to return

thank you for this wonderful journey so far! see y'all tomorrow! :- )",Ugw02cUIpFjiPlDR3eJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-20T14:33:32Z,0.9937762022018433

All my muscles are working hard, they're not used to stay still on my matt. (I usually do my meditation on the couch and my back is bend in comfort haha).

604.0,"So much growth in this practice!

1) This is the longest I've sat in meditative cross-legged! My mid back really doesn't tend to like that posture; I really appreciate the encouragement to lift hips as needed.

2) Slowly learning how to make the cross-legged pose my own. I can't really tell without a mirror if I'm aligned in head-heart-pelvis, so today I focused on making the posture comfortable. I also permitted myself to pause the video and take some long, luxurious breaths through a repeat of the side twists to soothe my mid-back.

3) Speaking of the twist, ""inhale to expand"" is finally starting to make more sense! Especially the wide lateral breath...I can feel my spine slowly relax into the twist with each breath!

4) Finally, counted breathing is near and dear to me, as someone with panic disorder who has counted many, many, many a breath. So this practice was comforting.

644.0,"Day 16:

Today was interesting!  I was glad for a simple seated practice today (a bit of my spine has been a little twingy after the past couple of days, so it was nice to take it a little easy), but it was interesting to explore something I've suspected, which is that my natural deep breaths are _way_ slower than these practices seem to expect.  (I have swollen allergy sinuses eight to ten months out of the year, it's a miracle I can breathe through my nose at ALL).  This turned into a great practice in SPEEDING UP my breathing, figuring out how much air I could get in and then back out in only a 3-4 count.  How hard and intentional did my breathing have to be to really properly empty it out in only a count of five?  It was a good challenge.

649.0,"I just finished this practice, 2 days late but at least I did it! After the 6:7 breath ratio I felt really frustrated because I was so clumsy with it and couldn't control it. When she said 'notice how you feel' I suddenly felt a wave of emotion and release and started crying. I didn't end up getting the 8:8 like some others in these comments (well done!) But I just wanted to write this comment to let anyone like me know that it's not necessarily all about DOING IT RIGHT immediately; the breath is our tool that subconsciously knows how we are feeling before we do and it is simply magical that we are able to use it to discover ourselves. If you didnt get it today, or a few days ago whenever you're doing this,just keep going,please 💗 the release will come and it feels so liberating in that moment.

782.0,"Guys, so many amazing things happened that I got to share:
- I was doing the ocean breath from the beginning but it wasn't until the last cycle that I truly FELT it going through my throat
- usually when I practice breathing the hardest part is exhaling, as I feel like I ran out of air before the counting ends. But this time it was the opposite!

When you said try not to fidget it's like you were seeing me because that's exactly what I was doing. 😂 But I was able to stop right away with the reminder and experience stillness.

I took the unharmed fawn from Blue and we followed him/her back to her mother; then they ran off.  It was like a dream.
      I'm glad Adrienne left the counting breath practice until now.  I think it's more advanced.  As I enter our medical center there's a sign with instructions for ""mountain breaths"", with 5 seconds of inspiration, 7 seconds of exhalation with a 3 seconds of pause in between.  These intervals and this counting is too difficult for most people, at least the young patients I teach.

I'm so incredibly grateful to you. This is the first time I'm really sticking with your 30 day yoga journey, and at the same time I'm trying to raise a border collie puppy I got on 9 January. I'm learning patience, awareness and acceptance. When I'm trying to get my puppy into a relaxed state of mind, I call it ""Benji practice"" :) I begin to see very surprising (at least for me) benefits of a daily practice: I am not so afraid to feel emotions (what a strange thing to say), and sometimes I'm paying attention to transitions while trying to find a comfortable position on a couch :) Day by day I'm more stable in high lunge, my toes turn more and more where I want them to in Warrior 1 and 2...I feel confident and proud in Warrior and Mountain pose, humbled and grateful in Childs' pose...I FEEL now, I'm more at ease with myself and - most importantly for me - I'm slowly, veeeery slowly, allowing myself to be proud of how far I've come, to accept and love myself truly. As I grew up in an abusive and dysfunctional family, I'm so happy now to slowly uncover myself thanks to yoga and therapy. I will return to the mat the next 15 days and beyond.

1256.0,"I am learning so much about myself on this journey, it’s unbelievable. Thank you, Adriene, for choosing this topic, which may be one of the most difficult ones you could have chosen for me, and probably for many others, too. It is very emotional for me, which at first is so hard, but then becomes incredibly liberating.

With Discipline as the theme for today, I dreaded a very hard workout... and of course, I put yoga until the very last minute. I’d have never expected this practice. It showed me that discipline can be many things, and that there may be room for me to reframe the concept of discipline in order to achieve a healthier relationship to it. Hey-ho, you never know what a good old YWA class may reveal to you! Sending lots of love to you, Adriene, and to the whole YWA community!

1257.0,"The fact that Adriene is wearing socks during a ""Discipline"" practice makes it for me. Discipline doesn't mean being harsh on yourself, or sweat or eat like your robot, just... Listening to our bodies, being gentle and finding ease, and somehow the rest will follow. This was wonderful to experience.
So grateful for the blessing that is Adriene, and each and everyone's breath.

1275.0,"Oh, my.  I have been really lucky to have been able to complete every single one of these practices - usually I’m behind by one or two (or more) by the half-way point.  It has been such a sublime pleasure!  Adriene, I have practiced with you for a few years now.  During this morning’s practice, it occurred to me how we have had the pleasure to see you grow and learn - and the good fortune that you have been kind enough to bring us along with you.  Each January brings a new chapter, and so far this is my absolute favorite.  It’s hitting me just at the right time, when I feel the need to practice more wholistically.  And big unexpected bonus- my running is improving by leaps and bounds (pun intended)!  I have found that I hold my torso more vertically when I run, and that makes breathing way more comfortable, which makes running a bit more fun.  I know you have practices for runners (they are in my library) - but I never realized how much cobra and even baby cobra would strengthen my back to hold me in a better running position.  Gifts hidden all around!  Please keep that spark of curiosity for all of us.  Love you!

1286.0,"30 min of breathing was what I needed today. The past few weeks have been super overwhelming and emotional due to things in my life and my family changing a lot in a short time, and yesterday was especially hard. Coming into practice today, I wrapped myself in a blanket cloak, cried a little bit, and breathed with everyone here <3

Side note, these ratios were super challenging for me, probably for the opposite reason than most. As a classical singer, I’m used to drills breathing in on 1 or 2 and out on 8, 16, even 20. In singing, I’m trained to be able to take in lots of breath very quickly, so inhaling slowly was a good exercise. Even the first 3 was a struggle, and every one after that proved a further challenge, but a good one.",UgxVcz2h9WF6oLbGoTR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-17T20:46:25Z,0.9795029163360596

He agreed, reminding me to call for the oxygen if needed. So to make a long story short whereas for months my oxygen levels hovered between 88-93, I recently saw it up to 95! First I've had enough hat in many months! Can't prove it of course, but I'm sure your wise guidance and my discipline in returning to the mat every day no matter what is the reason! At 78 I'm thrilled to still be able to find my self fighting for me! not always a pretty sight to be sure but always beautiful in its own way. Thank you Adriene.

Last year, like so many others I began a more regular practice and it got me through some of the darker days of lockdown here in the UK. The more I practiced the more I began to connect with and realise how integral breath was. I completed a few of your 30 day challenges last year and this is the first time I've completed it in real time, as it is being released. It's keeping me and my husband grounded through another lockdown here in the UK. I'm noticing my body growing stronger and how yoga poses are beginning to show up in daily tasks, helping me to move safely and minimize my pain. I'm very grateful.

I'll be honest - I didn't want to sit and just breath when I was feeling so tired and instead of using my breath to move through how I was feeling with it, I skipped the rest (after the first breath ratio round).  Some days you are not up for lots of movement and today I was not up for lots of breathing haha.  It's okay because I will come back to this practise maybe tonight or tomorrow.

I think I needed some stillness to bring some awareness to how I have been feeling and how I want to feel. I can't believe I've made it this far and I am so blessed to be here with everyone else on this journey or breath and discovery and healing. I'm pumped for what's to come!

1867.0,"I had an ex who often, when I asked what he was thinking about, would say ""nothing"". I was baffled. How does a person think about nothing? My mind is always whirring with a million things at once. He told me he has a ""nothing box"" where he can just think about absolutely nothing. 

When Adriene gets us to focus on our breath, there are tiny flits of a nothing box for me. Tiny moments where I feel like I'm just released from thinking about things. It's an incredible feeling of just being--just existing.

Before coming to the mat I'm constantly ruminating on my to-do list. Whenever we finish I just sit in peaceful bliss, not caring to move, wondering what was so urgent that I almost convinced myself I couldn't set aside 30 minutes for yoga (30 minutes I would have undoubtedly used to scroll aimlessly through TikTok somewhere else in my day). 

This is the first time I have managed to be consistent, and I have a feeling just having made it this far will be the motivation I need to make it to the end of the 30 days. But I really hope I have the discipline to continue on after because this has been such a sweet and beneficial part of my days.",UgzXuXVaAe2Rl0aaEKt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-17T13:48:47Z,0.9966999888420105

1881.0,"So, fun testimonial regarding this journey; I had planned to do a 30 day diet and workout from Jan-Feb, adding in some more disciplined time for study and meditation, and cutting out some of my worse habits. Part of that study was working through the book of John in Greek. In chapter 3 of that book Jesus speaks with a man named Nicodemus, and Jesus explains the nature of the spiritual life to him. No surprise here, Pneuma (Greek) and Ruach (Hebrew) can mean either Spirit, Breath, or Wind. After a couple years of practicing Wim Hof I was already pretty keen to the spiritual possibilities of breathing, but I'm very thankful to this practice for helping me to really dig into it right as I'm reading about this super enigmatic relationship between it and our spiritual life!",UgwdQgcmJhjcJOlpejR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-17T13:42:31Z,0.9929922819137573

1954.0,"Wow. This was a really special day. As I was doing these breathing drills, I reflected on the types of breaths I see during my shifts as a nurse on a daily basis. I reflected on images of my patients breathing during tonight’s shift. I listen to lungs at the beginning of my shifts, asking my patients to take a deep breath as I listen to the front and the back, each of the lobes. I give them medicines to help make breathing easier, maybe helping to remove fluid from their lungs so they can breathe better. I help them on and off of BiPAP or CPAP to assist them with taking breaths. I pay attention to the muscles they use as they breathe - is there a great work of breathing or is it natural and effortless? When they sleep, I notice the rhythm: is it regular, or are there pauses? And rarely (thankfully), I am at the bedside as I listen to final breaths. During this COVID pandemic my attention to the breath has only become that much more acute. I stood outside my family member’s door while they stayed in my hospital’s Covid unit battling the disease for an entire month, watching the breath, grimacing as I saw how difficult each one was for them. Watching how tired they got day after day just trying to breathe. On my unit, I watched their oxygen saturation while I went about my shifts, pleading with it to stay up high enough. I sighed with relief when they proned and the oxygen saturation improved. While that family member lived, I lost two others to this terrible disease this year. Unrelated to COVID, I watched another family member, at end of life, have their chest rise and fall with the assist of a ventilator. And I watched as the doctor extubated them and they breathed on their own for a time. I remembered how grievous it was to see my loved ones without their chests rising and falling from the breath when their life had gone from them. And as I breathed along with this video, reflecting on the breaths, my chest and belly expanding, my own lungs filling with air, feeling a sense of calm as I slowed my breath, engaging my parasympathetic nervous system, pumping the brakes on the seemingly endless fight or flight mode that is nursing, a sense of complete gratitude washed over me for the gift of breath. Our breath fuels our life. It’s so simple, so astounding, and as we breathe, we are partaking in life. We are blessed with such a gift. And as I finished the 8 second inhale and 8 second exhale, “exquisite stillness” being the how Adriene chose to describe it, i felt something very similar. A moment of complete calm, a respite from the sympathetic nervous system being constantly revved up. That lovely stillness was a gift from the breath. Thank you, Adriene. Thank you so much for helping me find a moment of reflection, gratitude, and peace. My soul was thirsty for that reprieve. ❤️",Ugx63L0FzIv_3huBhsx4AaABAg,10.0,33.0,2021-01-17T12:36:33Z,0.2207653499058607

1974.0,"This was so good!! I always forget to breathe in daily life, which sounds weird, but I just mean that I have dysregulated breathing patterns sometimes. I hold my breath frequently, particularly when I'm anxious or stressed, which leads me to sigh a lot too. I never used to notice this, it must sound like I am annoyed all the time, but I'm not - I'm nervous! Practising this discipline of breathing really, really helps with that, and really helps to calm me down when I can remind myself to breathe out.
I've also heard that breathing out slowly can convince your nervous system that you are not under attack, and so is very calming.

If you find yourself half naked
and barefoot in the frosty grass, hearing,
again, the earth's great, sonorous moan that says
you are the air of the now and gone, that says
all you love will turn to dust,
and will meet you there, do not
raise your fist. Do not raise
your small voice against it. And do not
take cover. Instead, curl your toes
into the grass, watch the cloud
ascending from your lips. Walk
through the garden's dormant splendor.
Say only, thank you.
Thank you.

2066.0,"When I started the video, I felt some discomfort in my body which was very distracting, and I thought about stopping and returning to the practice at another time when I feel better. But then Adriene started talking about how we can *use* the things that distract us, how we can bring them with us to the mat and work with them. That really was an eye-opener for me. 
I continued with today's practice, and it turned out to be EXACTLY what I needed! The breathing exercices brought so much calm to my mind and body. And as my nervous system was slowing down, the discomfort I had felt at the beginning also started to disappear. 
Yoga with Adriene is a true gift. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, dear Adriene. And thanks to everyone in this beautiful community for taking this time for yourselves and for practicing together. You are awesome!

2069.0,"Hey Adriene, hey fellow journey mates. I promised myself that I would only comment after getting past half the journey, coz then I'd know that I can and will finish the full 30 days, and it's funny that day 16 is Discipline, so synchronistic 😂😍. I can't explain fully in words how rewarding and fulfilling this journey has been. I had prepared a lot of words in my mind to tell you Adriene but now I'm falling short. I'd just like to thank you, deeply, for everything that you do, for a world you know nothing about. You're such a beautiful beautiful person and I hope you never forget this strength and power that you have. You're saving the world one breath at a time. You're saving my world. I'm eternally grateful.

Everyday I tell myself, if Adriene can wake up every day to do this for people she don't know, I can wake up and do it for myself. 

So far my experience is best described as FULFILLING. 

I am learning to honour MYSELF. 

I am learning to celebrate LIFE.

I am feeling ALIVE, BEAUTIFUL & LOVED.

May the sun always shine upon your life Adriene, and to you too, my fellow journey mates. This world is us. Be aware of it. And as Adriene said on day 14, take up space my darling, you're worthy of it all.

My friend Cowan studied Kundalini yoga. That focuses on opening the chakras, the seven energy centers of the human body.
