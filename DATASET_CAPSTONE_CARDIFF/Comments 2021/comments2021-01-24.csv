163.0,"Todays practice was really special and memorable for me. This is the 4th month I've been doing yoga with Adrienne 30 day challenges, and I've set the goal to do yoga with Adrienne for one year. And today was the strongest, most grounded, most centered I've ever felt on the mat. I started to have doubts about myself the last few days feeling like maybe I should be more advanced in my practice by now but today I felt the lesson surface that I am making progress, because I am coming to the mat everyday. And I am seeing that progress today. I was able to really pay attention to my center in every single move. And I'm finding that all the poses are becoming more healing than difficult. Poses like downward dog, or lunge, or even plank are becoming easier and more healing and rejuvenating than feeling like exercise. There's still very much more I will be improving on, and there are poses I still can't do or have trouble doing. But I know now that I am making major progress, and that feels HUGE!",UgwXBFsYUsp-6MsGj9t4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-19T20:29:40Z,0.9994798302650452

The down side of getting better at focus, at being in the moment, is that I have less to record at the end of a session about how I did with it.  The up side is that I know I was _in_ it as I was doing it, not thinking about what was right or wrong or what I'd say about it later, simply doing.

Day  23  of the journey.  At first, I mistook it for ""delicate"".(laughs)  For the past 23 days I've found myself dedicating time, energy, and breath to myself. And when I write this comment, which is my dairy routine, I pray for you all. And your comments are so full of Love that it makes me happy too. Perhaps dedicating something leads to receiving something.  love to you today too!

262.0,"January has been really difficult for me. One month ago I got the news my parents are getting a divorce. My best friend is very ill and was hospitalised the first week of the year. A dear friend of mine moved across the country. Depression and anxiety(GAD) are things I’ve battled for years. And in all this I’m just an 18 year old girl trying to figure out school, life and myself. I had a cold two weeks ago(didn’t practise) so I’m a few days behind but I’m honestly so proud of my myself for showing up on the mat everyday. Even on the days when leaving bed is a challenge.
Today, 30 seconds into practise, I cried. A lot. I tend to keep everything inside so that’s a pretty big deal for me. But it was a well needed release. Sending strength to all of you out there who’s also struggling atm<3

385.0,"During the practice today, there was so much external disturbance. A part of me kept getting a little annoyed and wanted to have a perfectly silent yoga environment. The minute I got into downward dog, a crow started cawing. Usually, that means it wants food so I kept thinking, just let me finish my yoga, I'll give it after. Then I thought for a second, I paused the video, gave the crow food and continued. The practice was so peaceful after that and the crow was happy.. It's like Adriene says, you fill your cup so you can serve yourself and others. It was a reminder that even though I live in this body, others also have things going on and they deserve kindness.

It makes me feel I can commit to anything and practicing makes it easier...this is a practice..and it is working.,Ugw7J3jyvVpZm02xIBN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-25T03:52:39Z,0.9474664926528931

Today, after feeling fatigued, I almost felt like crying when I sat on the mat and I realised how important it is to put this daily break for myself in my day. Today I totally lost sense of time and was surprised when the practice came to an end, I was enjoying it so much and was just in the moment. It would’ve been so easy for me to say I was too busy to stick with this series but I’m SO glad I haven’t given up on it.

541.0,"""Finding your breath is finding yourself"" Thank you for that, Adriene. I'm in a long period of healing from deep trauma, and often I feel I don't know who I am anymore, and it frightens me. I've been working to soothe myself and remember that I'm not a problem to be fixed. I can't ever be lost, I'm right here. And even in the midst of endless worries, I can find my breath, and I'm home. It reminds me also of a poem, 

""Just sit there right now
Don't do a thing
Just rest.

For your separation from God,
From love,

Is the hardest work
In this
World.""

- Hafiz

Reading your words,  knowing you are there, and being part of this community adds immeasurably to the ""Yoga with Adriene "" experience. Yesterday I turned 68 years old. Today I finished Breath Session  #23. I have started to pay attention to my breathing at other times, not just when I am on the mat.  Until three weeks ago I had never in my life done three consecutive days of yoga classes.  What a wonderful progression. I sort of feel like I am meeting myself again for the first time.   While I grieve for the loss, pains and sufferings of which so many people are having to deal,  having this experience reminds me of mystery of life and the love, beauty and amazing healing power of the earth.

572.0,"This was a weirdly emotional practice for me today. I’ve been super stressed tonight which spilt over onto my family, so when I got to the mat and was alone in the space I just burst into tears. At the end of practice though, I had my hand out at my side and suddenly it felt like someone was there holding my hand and I ended up crying a bit again, because it just felt so beautiful.

573.0,"First of all Adriene I loved your love letter today! So sweet and loving. Also, don't put  pressure on yourself. You can do it either way. Today I dedicated my practice to my mother. She is suffering from depression and today at the mat I felt like i was sending her all my energy. She needs it more than me so here it is. And as I am saying that, I feel the energy on my body 10 times more than I did before. Wow. I loved the practice today and one thing that I realized is that shavasana is also one of my favorite poses. I like to feel the earth especially on the summer barefoot. So laying on the round breathing with all of u helps me feel the earth, the ground and our roots so much more.

On my right side I even need to stand and place it. I try to make more space by making sure I move on an exhale but still it can't go. Is it about flexibility?

The time flew by and each movement felt great and it was like I was able to release that agitation and I feel so much better now. I am dedicating myself to keep up this practice more regularly throughout the year instead of letting it fade away after the 30 days. I'm actually starting to feel stronger and more flexible and I feel like this 30 day practice has produced more results than the previous 2 or 3 I've done.

711.0,"Today, I dedicate my practice to my Grandmother. I left my homeland of Poland to the United States at the age of 13. My grandmother was one of my Mother figures. I have missed her and my grandfather every day since. He passed away 3 years ago, but my grandmother is still alive at 83, and remains in Poland, all by herself. Every child of hers has moved to the US, and therefore so are her grandkids. My heart aches every time we talk, knowing that she is there, all by her lonesome. It just doesn't feel right. I haven't shared this with anyone in my family yet, y'all are first... BUT I'm 31 years old, still single, with no kids, and have been seriously considering moving back to Poland and spending the last years of her life with her. What a treasure would that be.. Today I cried, as I dedicated my ""Breath"" to her, and became that much more affirmed in my decision.

At 68, w extra padding on those legs combined w 🦖 arms I have never been able do do this, which frustrates me to no end.  Today hand on chair back, creeping down that other leg, grabbed that foot!!!

811.0,"This practice is working for me because I do so much better with a short daily practice as opposed to the conventional much longer practices 2 or 3 times a week. I am able to internalize the awareness of movement and  breath and retain it. What also works is the Hatha yoga discipline. My experience is that it is slower and deeper, with a wholeness of the combination of breath and asana. Sweating and panting is not my idea of a nourishing practice. Thanks Adrienne for all your hard work. You have invested so much into these lessons. It takes great effort and humility to prepare 'seamless' instruction for us all here every day.

When I read the email, I was really happy because it was once again particularly relevant to me and timely, as I've been planning and plotting projects in my head for the past few days, especially thinking of ways to bring more meaning to my life, show up as the best version of myself, and being of service to others. This was a reminder that dedication is key, but something I've been struggling with in recent months and years. Then, stepping on the mat showed me that it can indeed be difficult, and things don't happen overnight, as the body or mind (or both) can get in the way of the best of intentions. I wasn't 100% into the practice physically, as my body felt pretty tired and weak, but I definitely worked on the mental and spiritual aspect of it. I now feel more convinced than ever that those changes I want to make are needed and important, and I'm ready to really, truly dedicate myself to them. Thank you so much, Adriene, as always.

I was so wrong. I've always struggled with certain moves because of joint problems and weak wrists, but today I did the most planks/dfds since starting, and really holding them too.

1054.0,"Really enjoyed this practice! It was a nice full circle moment for me: When Adriene said in the beginning dedicate this practice to someone, the first that popped in my mind was to dedicate it to myself. I actually felt quite happy and proud that I was able to prioritize myself and self-care in the moment. I really was able to enjoy and complete this practice for myself. Then when we neared the end, in childpose, Adriene asked to breathe out love to someone else. At that moment I dedicated every single breath out to a different friend. This made me really feel the power of first caring for yourself before you can be there for others. A really powerful realisation, and that in just a short practice, thank you Adriene these practices mean a lot <3",UgxUP2KJdF0jeAL4zQ14AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2021-01-24T09:40:00Z,0.9997310042381287
