57.0,"Day 13: Not Done. Left around 12:10. I was pushing off doing yoga. I really wanted to go out, haven't stepped out of the house much in the last few months, even though the pandemic wave has receded for now and things are open. I wanted to go out today, on my own, but I guess I just didn't have enough courage to. I am not sure where I will go, what will happen, I am a bit scared. While doing yoga today, my right wrist did not feel right more than a couple of times. I stopped to rotate it a bit but it did not feel right. I know there might be something wrong with it or it is just a bit stiff, more than my left wrist definitely. Even my right  shoulder area felt a little stiff/ache today. So I stopped and I am a little disappointed and sad with everything. Even the slightest (bad) change in my emotions disrupt everything. I try that they don't, but it becomes difficult and I keep breaking down or feeling so, so low.

 Does this happen with anyone else too-- the wrist thing (left and right wrists feel different)?

I will try to come back tomorrow and do this practice from the top. As soon as I went to write this comment, I saw the one mentioning depression and thought ""oh I am definitely not depressed. I know what it looks like. I have been at a much, much low place than this."" But just feeling low and not doing anything is very disappointing. Maybe I will order some food from outside today. I don't know what to do to make myself happy. I will try to take a walk outside maybe tomorrow. 

Stay strong everyone. Life is one day at a time and I don't know why today even the breathing practice, or voice of adriene didn't work like it has all these days. I have been trying to learn to relax on command. I keep finding these small things like this routine that makes me happy or atleast helps for a while but just for a while. Then I am miserable again. How long can I go this way? Finding something new and then something else, and then something else, just to stay okay?

Sorry. Much love but today is not a good day.",Ugwi3ZiZQiFAGAS3QCd4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2021-07-19T13:45:22Z,-0.9988353848457336

I find that no matter where I am coming from, if I want to move a lot or wind down, your videos always help me to come back home to myself. <3

This is my second time trying 30 Days of Yoga. Attempt 1 was in spring and after 2 weeks I started to skip a bunch of days. For this round, I haven't missed a single day yet!! :D Between now and the last attempt, I've been doing any random videos that suited my fancy, sometimes everyday and sometimes a few times a week. :P Now, I miss when I can't do some yoga. 

Do you know if yoga eventually help to correct my hip hinge so that I can touch my toes in flat back? Also, I'm always curious what plant you have in the background. It's adorable.

350.0,"I'm nine days behind, but it's okay, because every practice I do is exactly what I need that day. Recently I've been putting myself through a hard time by overthinking a situation, I was numb, stuck in a loop of negative thoughts with no way out, crying myself to sleep every night and yoga (with Adriene) is the only thing that can get me out of my head when this happens. Even if I just lie on the mat and cry. Yesterday's and today's practice really helped me sort it out. I needed to Drop it and then allow myself to Feel good again.
So today, I'm feeling gratitude. (however clich√© that sounds)
Mantras are not my thing, but I'm a sucker for good quotes, and somehow, every single one of Adriene's sayings ends up rooting into my brain and becomes a part of my everyday inner dialogue. Some of them I don't understand right away and it takes a while until something happens and suddenly they become more then just pretty words and everything clicks into place. 
Today, it was ""Find what feels good"". I always liked this idea, but only took it in a physical sense. Today I realized that I don't want to listen to the doubts that only bring me down anymore, because they don't feel good. But there are also good things worth fighting for, giving me hope and that's what I should focus on because that's what feels good. I have hope that I can fix the mistakes I've made, and if not, then that I can learn from them for the next time. 
Thank you, Adriene, for helping me fix my moral compass, replacing my negative inner dialogue with positive thinking and helping me become the best version of myself that I can be each day. You have no idea how many times a day I tell myself to breathe, lots of love in and lots of love out, find length and grounding, smile... and it works! :)

When I'm here doing the practice, I feel myself healing and growing strong and learning to understand and love the body I now find myself in. This has become a highlight of each day.

I was hoping she would provide a modification other than lifting heels ( as if my heels have ever touched the ground in  that pose before lol).  Can anyone suggest an alternative to that squat?   I hate to just go back to childs pose where i feel like i lose my momentum and flow.   Thank you!  Namaste!",UgzaFmA-qqtag6mNGR14AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2021-01-16T14:39:09Z,-0.999091386795044

632.0,"I am so grateful for this practice! 

Today was hard to show up for. I was busy all day and then sometime in the last hour or two I got really nauseous. Normally, I think I would have tried to force myself through my regular workout and burned out by the time I got to my yoga practice but with the daily reminder/emphasis on self love and self care I.... took the night off. 

Which is new and different, for me. 

I decided to come to show up for ""Breath"", before relaxing the rest of the night. Today's theme of focusing on how we feel was especially interesting because I think I actually feel considerably better than when I unfolded my mat. Physically, I DO feel really tired, I DO feel nauseous. I apparently have a little bit of a headache too, and some of my joints are stiff and bothering me.  I think I have a little nagging anxiety floating around somewhere in the background. But I realized how much I need to ACTUALLY let myself rest. And now I will do just that. Because I deserve it. I deserve to rest and recover.

So I've been frustrated a couple of times during this program 'cause my body cannot do some stuff, but just connecting to my body is such a win for me. I listen to it, and I adapt to what feels good. I now try to be very mindful about what my body is saying, and I can feel tightness in some parts, soreness, where I put the most amount of pressure, even some sinus pressure (lol)... but just that by itself is huge for me. Is a deeper way to love oneself and one's body. So thank you, Adriene, and the whole YWA community.

773.0,"Wonderful session as usual.  
      A modest suggestion:  A friend of mine with spinal stenosis like me, but worse, so she had surgery said she tried this program but stopped because she couldn't do ""half of the moves"".  I replied I couldn't do about a third of them but I still enjoyed it.  I thought about how tonight I could do a boat with no problem, I have trouble with simply sitting cross legged for any length of time because I tore an ankle tendon two years ago.  Adrienne, you're great at presenting alternatives for many postures, but maybe you can include options for even simple things - like sitting or doing a cobra (again tough for people with back conditions).

778.0,"Day 13. Check! Today was very special to me. First of all, it was the day I felt most aware and present. I could tell that in the boat pose, where I felt extremely strong, the strongest I ever felt in that pose. I did everything as I wished, as I felt, and I noticed a huge difference. At the end I even enjoyed the meditation part, which usually feels bitter sweet to me, because even though it makes me feel good, it also makes me feel frustrated and impatient.
Second of all, this practice got me thinking about feeling fear. Sometimes I struggle to control my thoughts, and at times they can fill my whole mind with negative things, mostly related to my fears. So here I am, asking this question to myself, Adriene and everyone else reading this: how do you cope with this feeling, with fear?
This is an important subject to me.

859.0,"I‚Äôve been practicing yoga for about 7 years now on and off, and for several years following some of Adriene‚Äôs videos. Today was a challenge getting to the mat. I was a bit low energy and had already went for a jog today so I wasn‚Äôt very motivated. This was the perfect practice that I needed. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt so deeply rooted in either boat pose or the yogic squat. I‚Äôm not naturally very flexible and always struggle with core-centered poses, so both of these have come such a long way in my time doing yoga. I used to have to hold on to my legs for dear life in boat and couldn‚Äôt even come close to a low squat (it looked more like a high squat with heels raised). Now I can fully extend my boat pose with relative ease and come down completely in the squat with heels down and no support from my hands. Yoga is all about the small moments that make you feel connected and accomplished. Thanks for another great 30 day journey, Adriene!

1122.0,"Hello from London, my lovely friends! When we were in boat pose, it made me think of something I heard recently from Roshi Joan Halifax, a Buddhist teacher. She says, ‚ÄòStrong back, soft front.‚Äô

In her own words: ‚ÄòAll too often our so-called strength comes from fear not love; instead of having a strong back, many of us have a defended front shielding a weak spine. In other words, we walk around brittle and defensive, trying to conceal our lack of confidence. If we strengthen our backs, metaphorically speaking, and develop a spine that‚Äôs flexible but sturdy, then we can risk having a front that‚Äôs soft and open, representing choiceless compassion. The place in your body where these two meet ‚Äî strong back and soft front ‚Äî is the brave, tender ground in which to root our caring deeply.‚Äô

Just thought it was wise and beautiful, and seemed fitting. I‚Äôve had a very chaotic day so far, but this practice felt like a total energetic reset so I can move through the rest of my day stress-free, amongst the chaos ü•∞üôèüèª",UgwcBP0e3vdQHuUU8Zp4AaABAg,4.0,220.0,2021-01-14T17:27:42Z,0.9859974384307861

I've been dealing with the aftereffects of a frozen shoulder for the better part of two years; physical therapy helped a bit but I didn't get to 100% movement and I didn't want surgery. Since I've started yoga my shoulder has been gaining movement and strength, so the tears are of joy.

1238.0,"Obviously (tho who am I to define obvious) this journey and yoga, in general, has a lot more depth than just the fitness aspect. However, the fitness side is nice too and what I thought of today, was that working out, exercising, moving your body (which ever ecpression you prefer) can be sooo much fun! The process of putting in the work and seeing your practises grow is so rewarding. I wish more people could see it this way because the fitness culture kind of makes us see what's missing, what we need to get rid of, how we can shrink etc. What if we, instead, thought about how we could grow and noticed how far we've already come?

Then I decided to just do these videos especially since some of them are longer than 20 minutes. Even though I still do like meditation and pilates, this yoga journey is exactly what my body and soul have been needing this month! I am reading a book right now about how to let go of shame and how about embracing your vulnerability actually gives you power over your feelings. And it really aligned with today. When we were in a seated pose in the beginning and Adriene was talking about letting go what you think you know about yoga and how we need to just feel it out, I realized I was not feeling it. I was feeling shame for being hunched over and not having enough energy to sit up straight as much because of my back and neck tightness. I realized though that, that was what I needed to feel, not shame but feel how my body was feeling today. When I wiggled my way into what I was actually feeling and not what I thought I should be feeling, the entire practice changed for me. And also with the wiggling and finding how my body moved in cat/cow and then to downward facing dog, also helped me just feel for myself. Thank you Adriene!

1521.0,"In the squat.... Adriene: ""Ground through the back body"" Me: grounds so hard I roll over backwards! 
Seriously though, today brought me to a little revelation. I started looking into yoga a couple of years ago now as a way to stretch and improve my flexibility, having always scoffed and turned my nose up at it before as some sort of hippy thang. Adriene sold it to me so much I've lost count of how long I've been doing a video (almost) daily, sometimes even twice a day. And although I've gained some flexibility and can get into poses I couldn't to start with, I'd never really stopped to think about the mental aspects. I've lost count of how many times my husband has complained that I've changed over the last couple of years, moaning that I stand up for myself now and don't just bow down and take s**t like I used to. Hadn't put the two together until I listened to what Adriene was saying today and the penny suddenly dropped: yoga has taught me to care for and about myself! It has changed the way I think about myself, and that has changed the way I act and react to the world around me. Possibly not good for that world, but good for ME!",UgxexsMCb80E3ZHdQvV4AaABAg,2.0,35.0,2021-01-14T09:51:01Z,-0.7396412491798401

But I have a question: I hurt my back during class a few days ago and had to pause (I think it was Day 7 or 8). Now I‚Äôd like to get back into your classes again. Where do I start? Just where I stopped? Or at the current lesson? Or should I start all over again?

Kind regards and many thanks,

I forgot to be graceful because, well, there is no one to present myself to. But this, this practice made me realised there are so many ways to take care of oneself and others, there are so many things that are worthy of my gratitude, and most importantly, I am here for me. So I can choose to be graceful for myself, because I have been showing up for myself every single day for the past five years or so on the yoga mat.

And the more I notice, the more I understand not to take my body for granted.

1633.0,Im a senior in high school right now and needless to say it's been a rough year and my grades haven't been doing so hot and with everything going on in the world I don't really feel comfortable going out of state for college anymore. I actually managed to stumble across this channel by accident since I was just trying to find something to do in quarantine and I've been overweight since 6th grade but I never thought about doing yoga and I can say with certainty that this is the most motivated I have felt in a while. When this first started I could barely hold plank and downward dog but I can tell how much I've improved and it's a GREAT feeling.

1690.0,"Adriene, there was a time in my life where I was in pretty bad shape with ptsd. See, I am a paramedic, or at least I was. The stress was getting to me. I wasn't sleeping, I was so on edge at work that I would become really unwell even when I heard other crews calls come in over the radio. I was in the worst shape and had to make a decision on how to move forward. Either deal with my mental health, or... well I decided the alternative wasn't an option. 

I found Revolution. The 30 day challenge you did back in 17 (I think). And I think it was in one of those videos, when holding a plank far longer than I thought I could, you said ""find your inner smile"". I don't want to oversell this, but those four words and the practice that they represented, well, it may have saved my life. 

Thank you for being your caring, authentic, amazing self. Thank you for sharing your practice with me, and millions of others. You'll never be able to know how grateful I am. I know that the opportunity will likely never come where I am able to repay you but I want you to know that because you were able to help me, I've been able to help others.

Telling my riding students to find their center or find an upward current of energy up the front body  and a downward current down the back. I love that these simple ideas are a great help to something as intricate as horseback riding, which has a lot to do with posture, balance, and emotions.
