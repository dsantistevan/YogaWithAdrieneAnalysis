Both emotionally and physically I find power through my breath as I go about my day. Finally, I wanted to note that I attempted to touch my head to the ground like you and... misjudged...

Day  14 of the journey

""space""
I practiced, wondering if these meant room or universe.

I felt that they could mean either.

It is the space within me, and it is somehow connected to my internal room and the  internal universe.
That feeling seemed to deepen my practice.


May the wonderful space you all create help you.
Please take care of yourself.

447.0,Hi i love your videos. What does it mean to become part of the membership> wasn't in this video but i was wondering about it in another video when i heard something about the Yoga wA Membership. What does the membership include? Just curious... I'm so greatful you help me through this time with so much fear around. Your Videoso just help me to center and relax. I wished we wouldn't live in fear but i can't change it. I just think you help many people being supportive and to come back into the light. Yoga is a great tool and you're so light hearted. That makes it different from many other teachers and its fun to do Yoga like that .. thanks for that!,UgzJVvEyoC4LISwq_M14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-21T22:56:36Z,0.9996050000190735

It's nice to realize that, even though I'm not keeping up with every single day all 30 days in a row, some 4,000 people did this practice alongside me today.  I feel good.  I feel not-alone.

Going to keep taking Saturdays off and continuing on with whatever day comes next on Sunday, I think, at least through the end of this 30-day journey.  It's wonderful to realize that, even though I very much did need the break, my body was ready and so very happy to work as hard as I asked it to today.  My core is a little stronger than it was two weeks ago.  I've figured out how to create enough space in my downwards-facing dog that I actually can step a foot all the way up between my hands in one step, at least sometimes.

652.0,ah Bliss. It was my birthday yesterday and somehow I didn't find time for practice so I am a day behind. This is just what I needed.. but could i locate my foot with my leg in the air - no!! It made me laugh .. there it was - visibly up there hovering but connecting my hand to my ankle - a little beyond me.. I nearly caught it one side... Looking forward to progression with that. What has been noticeable is that I no longer have pain in my left buttock just walking around. Now it's painless.. I've lived with that pain for about 5 years. This fortnight is the best gift I could give myself. Namaste x,UgztcVRxskcA6VaiUId4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-16T17:16:09Z,0.9893039464950562

That when I stood in that star pose and you talked about taking up space - it was like a huge wave of emotion washed over me.

I just wanted to lay in bed forever and sleep, because that's the closest state to being dead that I can get like NOW.

For the past three months, I have felt pain in my left arm (had some diagnostic tests this week) and some hip discomfort ( a little osteoarthritis) but I feel more aware of my body now and an overall sense of comfort and elongation and space and more openness --despite the fact that yoga is new for me and some of the postures are difficult for me--along with the movement from one into another.

So far my experience is best described as simply wonderful. It has not all been wonderful, some days I have wanted to cry, felt so frustrated and annoyed at myself for NOT BEING ENOUGH! But, I think what has made it wonderful is that as the days have gone by, I have developed a deeper connection to myself and my breath and body, a connection that I had lost along the sometimes thorny and winding path of life. These past 14 days I have spent learning to honour AND celebrate the beauty that is being alive, to throw away the notion that there is any part of me that is not ENOUGH. I still get frustrated. But, I have smiled while falling out of poses more often than I have frowned. I have learned, I am learning, to breath like I love myself and really, really, deeply mean it. I wasn't expecting this when I stepped on the mat on the first day. I almost didn't step on the first day. But I am so, so grateful that I did, to myself, to Adriene and Benji, and to every single person who has stepped on their mats with me everyday, to share in each others journeys.

1243.0,"Hi Adrienne and yogis,
I‚Äôm so enjoying my daily sessions of me time. And I have an analogy that came to mind doing the twist on the floor, which I wanted to share with you. Imagine I am a towel that has absorbed worries and baggage and in the twisting move, all that seeps away ( just like wring out a towel while you remove water). Then as I breath in, I am able to absorb clean clear water to reset/start again. It all goes with the breath so it‚Äôs a purifying feel.
I hope you like it.
I feel cleansed and ready to start again now.
Love to you all

I wish I could say that at the age of 28, that I was closer to having all my ducks in a row, but I do not. However, coming back to practice with Adriene always reminds me to accept where I am today and to try staying in the present moment. Challenges will always arise, whether they are out of your control or you're struggling to fight with your own inner demons that constantly tell you that you're not good enough. The important thing that YWA teaches us is how to combat those moments in a loving and mindful way. I have to learn to forgive myself for being so hard on myself about how my body is, how my degenerative scoliosis makes me feel as if it's holding me back from doing amazing things.  But, I know that ultimately it's my mindset that I need to work on and that even if my back/hips may not go back completely to normal, I can still reach my goals and aspirations. That's what I keep trying to tell myself anyway and daily yoga practice continues to help me with that.",UgwZht_49vWS1kDY_y14AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-15T16:37:34Z,0.9972255229949951

By the end of the practice it hit me that it's like a repetition to what happened two years ago. But everything worked out just fine even if I struggled. I know it doesn't make sense to anyone but it does to me. And it made me cry again. I can do it! I just need time.
