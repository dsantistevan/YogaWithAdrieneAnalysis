4.0,"I started this practice last March, I stopped halfway through due to some circumstantial situations and I stopped doing yoga all together. In my new home, with my new job, I decided in January that it was time to complete this practice. I started from the beginning and here I am- a month and a half later- this made me so proud of myself. To say I do my yoga again and to realize how much change I made in my life in just a year. 
This practice made me cry, groan, and sweat. But I kept coming back. I feel more in tune with my heart, my mind, my body and for the pun, my breathe. 
I'm so grateful for this life we live.

No matter how rough the times are and how hard it is to hold everything together, Adrienne and Benji have always been there for me, guiding me through a practice, which on some days was the only thing that somehow worked well.
Today was the first time I literally cried during practice. Not because I was sad for it to end (a new 30 day challenge is already waiting) but because I felt such a wave of relief during ""knocking on heavens door"" after a particularly hard and sad day. I couldn't stop crying and smiling and laughing all at the same time. Never have I experienced this in any other workout. ❤️

Today I found myself turning my head/neck in bad ways to see on my laptop screen what was going on (very glad I wasn't just using my phone today!). For example, I probably lifted my head about 5 times near the end to see if I was still supposed to be in corpse pose.

You're helping me change my life, today is day 30 of the journey, day 16 since I went back working, and not one single axiety attack since. Also, I could never in my wildest dreams imagine that I could practice by miself for 34 minutes (that's how long my self made practice went by),.

I'm very impressed with the power of this little tired brain of mine.

Thank you, I will never forget this.

114.0,"Adriene,
Thank you. I have not practiced yoga in maybe 6 months. I last practiced on day 29. I cannot pinpoint where I lost the connection, which saddens me. Then out of a strange sense of shame, I found myself afraid to get back into the practice. I don't know if I wanted to avoid the self shame of not having taken care of myself, or if I was afraid to dive into the self intimacy that this practice brings. With that said, I was terrified to learn that you would not be there to guide me through this. I was sure I wouldn't remember what to do or how to do it....but I closed my eyes, I trusted, and I breathed. And it all came back to me. Eventually I found comfort in opening my eyes and knowing your guidance would be there to inspire me...an acutely spiritual metaphor for living with a higher power. Not only was doing this on my own okay, it was exactly what I needed. And it reminded me of what I am most grateful to you for: you did not give me this gift, you taught me to discover it within myself. I am eternally grateful for that. My experience teaches me that I often do stray and do lose track of who I want to be, but I promise to always come back, and im blessed to know that this will always be there for me, because it is within me.",UgyEHDORKoys46FDxlN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-10-06T21:11:10Z,0.9979388117790222

Now that I am free of those rotten bonds of an abusive and deceptive relationship, I decided to dedicate the month of September to redoing Breath. I didn't miss a single day, showed up for myself, and I was saved by Adriene yet once again. Day 30 was 100% me, with Adriene's voice constantly ringing in my head. When I finally got to savasana, and when I was about to say namaste, I was overflown with emotions and I started crying like a baby. Adriene has saved me from my darkness time and again. This journey of breath was an important one. I even got a ring that has the word ""breathe"" engraved on it. Thank you, Adriene, for bringing joy back into my life, thank you for reminding me to keep breathing. Thanks to you I know that I will be alright.",UgzQNJMB6VWJETaXxkh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-10-01T10:28:52Z,0.9987344145774841

I started in June (5 months postpartum) and fell off…I felt like I couldn’t move the way I used to and my body was still betraying me…

I tried to pick back up where I left off in mid July (6 months postpartum) and thought ok, my body has been here before, it’ll know what to do. But I fell off again and felt discouraged.

I decided to re-start the journey from the beginning in August and I successfully completed this 30 day yoga journey with only one day missed and I am so happy I stuck to it. My body still doesn’t do the things it did before my pregnancy but I feel like it will eventually get there someday with practice. It still feels good to move!

185.0,"Hello, Adriene! 

I just want to thank you from all my heart for your yoga practices. I started my yoga journey with you 28.01.2021 and been doing yoga for every single day (I missed only two days). Thankfully to you I created a great habit and found for myself the best way to know and listen to myself. 

I started from your first yoga challenge - 30 Days Of Yoga, I liked this challenge a lot and then decided to do another one from you, and another one and then another and here I am. Today I finised all your yoga challenges that you posted for now, I feel myself stronger, physically and mentally, I feel relived and I found activity, which helps me to feels myself better in all ways. 

I want to thank you for this, my guide, which showed me the way in this amazing journey. I really appreciate this practice, I really appreciate you. You helped not only me, but thousand, maybe even million people with this practice. I feel myself grateful for this and for being your student, even if we don't know each other personally.
Thank you a lot. 

From all my heart to yours, namaste.",UgxRWxo3TFPV550ctld4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-08-28T17:50:22Z,0.9996938705444336

Even when my mind is racing I feel swept up in the movements and am learning to accept things as they are. Adriene is wonderful in so many ways.

187.0,"Hey Adrianeeeee, I have done one of your yoga videos every week day, not weekends, since the first of Jaunuary, but like the third, or second week of August I  slowly stopped, because now I have to be a lot more time  than before at school. When I come back home at 5pm, after 9 hours, I have to shower, do homework, study, and when I end up with all that, I just want to watch youtube or instagram. But this week was especially long, becuase I had SEVEN tests in total, so I really needed some of this, Im probabyly not going to make it til the end, cause its late, and I have to take dinner, but I´ll update y´all later. 
Please keep taking care of yourselves and get vaccinated if you can
Well, I have done 16 beautiful minutes, and I loved every single second, not only my body needed it, but MY MIND.

I wanted to follow the whole routine with Adrienne but in doing so had to constantly look up!  Maybe in the editing process a subtle cue (chime) could be added to know when to change.

190.0,"I was going to skip this last one because I HATE endings and goodbyes (I usually won't even watch the last couple of episodes of TV series lol). But this was so beautiful and I discovered so much about myself and my relationship to yoga. For instance, I realised that I love taking some more time at the beginning of practice to meditate, breathe, and do some twists and stretches while seated. I realised I really love me some runner's stretches. And I actually really DO have the tools to find what feels good - for 50 minutes too! It brought tears to my eyes by the end.

197.0,hey adrienne... great 29 days.. but just some feedback .. day 30 wasnt so good. it is very hard to do the yoga practice and try and watch the tv at the same time.  yes understand about breath but suggest you scrap the silent stuff.  maybe dont do the breath but say what pose you are in.  we had to turn the tv off after five minutes and change to a different one which kinda wrecked the 30 day journey.  btw we love your yoga.. just didnt like this one day.,UgyPjRor9G0iY_Q_Byp4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-08-23T20:26:11Z,-0.9930209517478943

Cuz sometimes i get paralyzed and do need guidance, i do need help. So today, the feeling of confidence in my self was so overwhelming, i almost got to do the crow pose and started crying.

I've very much enjoyed the series! Thank you for posting. 
Without the spoken guide, I had to continually watch the screen to move through the flow. That constantly took me out of the meditative flow of the practice.

239.0,"Hi Adrienne,
I can express to you enough how you’ve helped me to change my life. I’ve been doing to odd video here or there for the last year along with other YouTube channels but always enjoying yours the most so returning to you frequently. But I was new to yoga so I would stand in my living with reiki healing music on just focusing on breathing and basic stretches that’s I enjoyed from head to toe. You taught me from one of the first videos I watched of yours to “have the experience” forget about what you look like...feel the move...so that’s what o would do, unguided for myself. But life got in the way and I dropped from 5 days a week to 1. A month ago I decided to change that and as I’d seen your beautiful free programmes I decided to pick on and start my daily home yoga practice.
From the first session I cried either on completion or at some point along the way, it was so releasing and healing I can’t even put it into words. It has been beautiful.
I feel so blessed that I’ve found you. I’ve created a group on telegram and am sharing each video each day with some friends and they are beginning to change their lives too through this gift of your awesome guided videos.
Adrienne, you are an Angel on earth, a light worker. Honestly I am changing my whole life because of this experience and that with your help. This last episode blew me away!! I was sweating and crying and I just couldn’t believe how far I’ve come with this one programme
Thank you for existing in this lifetime in this way. You are an old soul and we are blessed to have you in our world helping humanity to shift. Bless you and you beautiful soul!

246.0,"This entire journey with breath has been beautiful. Some days it was hard to sit still and just breath-I wanted to get moving! Now I use these breathing techniques and awareness in everything that I do. My default is chest breathing, but these 30 days practicing filling up my belly and sides with air has been eye opening. I realized that I’m constantly holding in my stomach in to look skinnier, which isn’t conducive for full belly breaths.

An honest note about this final practice: I was absolutely NOT interested in performing my own practice. When you took your mic pack off I had a mini panic attack- what was I supposed to do for 50 whole minutes 😳 I just came here to follow instructions!! Thank you for pushing me outside of my comfort zone and forcing some confidence down my throat in the most nurturing way possible. You were right, I had everything I needed already and I completed the whole 50 minutes! 

What an incredibly empowering life changing 30 days, thank you so much for everything that you do! ❤️❤️❤️",UgydsYLLneGBZvQJKil4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-07-30T04:45:10Z,0.9947395920753479

255.0,"This is the first time I was truly able to enjoy the 30th day practice. I did 30 days of yoga and yoga camp before and the last day would never leave me feeling content like it did today. I'd been returning back to my mental challenges after a steep recovery (of course with Adriene being a strong pillar of my journey). I didn't feel anything during the last week of this practice but decided to continue nevertheless. The last 2 days were extremely difficult due to a personal issue and I found myself somewhat spiralling back. And then this morning my mindless scrolling brought me to Adrine and Benji on instagram and somehow that was enough of a push to jump down from the bed and get myself together for this practice. I couldn't believe that all these poses which once seemed challenging in isolation were a part of one full length practice with no audio cues and yet I had the mental and physical strength and energy to do it and feel replenished after the video. Adrine might never know the ways in which she has saved me and continues to save me. I have come to trust her process on days I can't trust myself or anything about life. The process eventually works. Might take days, weeks or months but it does work.
This is my second time commenting because I just had to let these feelings out and this feels like a truly safe space that you guys have created. Much love. Thank you Adrine, Benji and this lovely community. Here's to a lifetime of Yoga with Adrine. :') <3",UgxF6QEZtvmhblkd1q94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-07-26T08:02:39Z,0.9940436482429504

271.0,"Even though it took me over three month to complete this challenge, I am feeling proud of myself to complete this beautiful journey that has allowed me explore and reconnect with my breath, body, mind, spirit, and the present moment. As for this last practice, when you said you were going to turn off your mic and we were going to freestyle it, not gonna lie, I freaked out for a second since I saw that the video was 50 mins and I didn't know that I could freestyle it for so long. However, your trust in me that I already possessed the necessary vocabulary and movements to do this really helped me tranquilize the doubts of my mind and thus, I trusted that my intuition and body would guide me to do the asanas that will feel good for me and.... wooowwww! Free styling yoga is something I'm for sure going to be doing more in the future! Since I was solely focused on doing what felt good for me every step of the way, all of my focus and energy were concentrated in that instead on what the instructor was indicating me to do, thus my movements and my breath felt stronger, more committed, and flowed easier from into the other. Thank you, thank you, thank you Adriane for creating this space for us to explore this beautiful practice.

I love the familiarity of each year's theme integrated into the music, it wakes me up a little and reminds me of the place I learned to be in through each of the 30-day journeys.

301.0,"Today has been very emotional for me. I started doing yoga with Adriene almost 3 years ago at a very dark time. I was struggling mentally, I wasn't happy with where I was, I got diagnosed with a panic disorder and had health issues due to my anxiety. That's when I said I was going to turn it around and I started the very first Yoga with Adriene journey, 30 Days of Yoga.

I told myself I wouldn't force myself to do it every day but I completed the journey. Since then, I did all other 30-day challenges - Yoga Camp, Revolution, True, Dedicate, Home and now Breath. Sometimes it took me several months to complete the journey but I did it. 

And now as I am completing this last yoga journey (at least until next January) I found myself crying at the end. Although I turned my life around during these 3 years and found happiness in many ways, with Covid and everything, my panic attacks started coming back. 

So although I feel yoga helped me tremendously, I somehow felt like a failure as I was completing Day 30, I felt like I was back at square one. 

But I'll take this Adriene's sentence with me: ""If you are ever unsure of how to begin again, may this practice remind you to start with a new breath.""

So tomorrow I'm starting again, with a new breath, and going back to where it all started - Day 1 of '30 Days of Yoga'. And then I'll do it all over again. Well, maybe not tomorrow... but the day after that for sure. :)

Thank you Adriene. You are a blessing.",UgyOSBgLSvpeNJiid2N4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-07-05T20:41:53Z,0.9060348868370056

373.0,It took me 2 months. I took on this journey because collage and work were really stressful and the time I took for myself always feel empty but this was a challenge. To let it go.

374.0,"When I realized we were doing our own positions, at first I felt angry! I had been finding peace in letting go of analyzing whether I was doing the ""right"" thing in each moment. 

Then I felt alarmed and anxious - that I would do a bad job, that I wouldn't try hard enough, that I'd be ""lazy"" and only do ""easy"" positions. That 50 minutes would be way too long.

I started, trying to focus on my breath. My mind was a room full of ricocheting ping pong balls. It took a little bit, but finally in a forward fold my brain started to quiet. 

Then there was this wash of realization that I had 50 minutes in which to move -- however I wanted to --. 

And then i cried during yoga for the first time. What a feeling.


Thank you, Adrienne.

(p.s. - I've restarted this journey 2 or 3 times because I lapsed for so long between videos. April was when I started it this last time - got here today, June 8. I'm really motivated by the saying ""anything worth doing is worth doing poorly"" [not that any yoga practice done earnestly can be done poorly, but ""anything worth doing is worth doing {even if our reality will be different from our goals and/or expectations}"" just doesn't have the same ring.])",Ugw_6iFoph8iVS6kBll4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-06-09T03:06:59Z,-0.9963961243629456

380.0,"I just finished the 30 days, started 33 days ago! 1 day I did no yoga as a break (during the first week when it felt very tough), another day I was out of my house all day and found no time to dedicate to it, and 3rd day I re-did Heal as I'd just had my first vaccine shot and my arm was too sore to do anything strenuous. 
I don't think I've ever cried during any of the days except for today. At first I felt a tiny bit of panic when I realized there'd be no mic and it was all on me, but I trusted in Adriene and myself, and within a few minutes I was using my breath and remembering the flow. It gave me such warm fuzzies every time I'd take a second to look at the video and see her either doing something completely different or the same pose as me. At one point when I glanced over, she glanced over at the camera at the same time and smiled, and I smiled back. At the end of it I'm feeling emotional, to my surprise. She was right, I was capable of doing it. <3

403.0,"Adriene,
This was a wonderful journey and the first one of the 30 day yoga journeys I completed (took 6 weeks but I did it). I just wanted to let you know that while the thought behind the cue-less class is beautiful, it's also ableist and I'm certain you don't mean to exclude anyone. 

Visually impaired people rely strongly on the verbal cues because they cannot follow your movements very well, some people not at all. Can you imagine the frustration of getting through 29 days only to find on day 30 that there is no way to complete the journey? That yoga is just another thing that the world is telling you is not for you? I meditated on this for the entire final practice and I do have a suggestion, if you would consider it. You could try doing an alternative video where you just say the names of the postures as it's time to transition. This would still let visually impaired people participate and trust themselves to know what to do since you're not giving all the cues just signals so they know what the practice entails. 

I love how inclusive you've made yoga and how it feels like practicing with a friend. I hope you consider my suggestion. Thank you so much for your channel and the fun you bring to the mat.",UgwnQNhgNe3cgPcFNRl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-06-01T18:38:48Z,0.9969902038574219
404.0,"I first started yoga at the beginning of lockdown with the Home practice. In a time when many of us had no choice but to stay in our homes during quarantine, the Home yoga journey provided me with some much-needed stability and peace of mind, giving me something to hold onto as well as the fortitude and grace to make it through a difficult year. Now we are hopefully nearing the end of this pandemic, and it finally feels like we can begin to breathe again. Home was what gave me the tools to make it through, but Breath is what helped me understand how to live (and breathe!) again. I know everyone says it, but it really is true that yoga has changed my life for the better.

408.0,"Today was day 365 of my yoga journey. I've been doing Yoga with Adriene every day for exactly a year now! I never expected to complete a whole year of daily practice because I don't much like doing exercises, but I actually did it!! 

I started out following the monthly calendars (although I used to switch up the days a lot) but during the past two months I've been trying to choose a practice that aligns with how I feel. That's hard for me though, as I don't like intense work-outs but at the same time often think a practice should contain a certain level of intensity so that I get stronger or burn calories... As a result, I often dreaded doing yoga and look at the clock a lot during practice to count down the time that was left. 

Today I took a moment to reflect on my yoga journey and what I have learned. The first thing that popped into my head was Adrienne saying that yoga is all about connecting body and mind, and finding what feels good. But then I realized that I had not really been trying to find what feels good in this past year as I mostly followed the practices from a feeling of obligation (I didn't want to lose my streak and have to tell everyone, thinking it is important to exercise for health benefits, making sure I have that body that people want to see on a women, etc. But not because I actually liked it). So this might explain why I didn't feel as amazing as all the other people posting comments about their yoga journey: because I had not yet found what feels good for me. I did become more flexible and a little stronger but not much more than that.

So I decided to give it another try, by chosing this practice and listen to what my body and mind told me would feel good. This turned out to be a very gentle and slow practice, but it was 33 minutes long (which is longer than I have been practicing lately) and I hardly looked at the clock! And although there were some thoughts trying to guilttrip me about not working hard enough, I really enjoyed the practice and it brought me so much peace. 

I've been thinking about whether I want to continue doing yoga this next year and after today's practice I have decided to do so. I now know enough to put together my own practice, so the challenge will be to listen to my body and mind and find what feels good. Thank you Adrienne for this insightful journey and teaching me to listen to myself. Let's see what that will bring, I am excited for it!

And I love the music on this video btw! :)",UgwCyPGE1B8yJJ2CsLV4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-05-31T20:50:17Z,0.20994502555955116

The past 29 days have been a truly amazing, enriching experience and I've loved every video up until this one, but by minute 32 of this final workout I felt so frustrated, and angry, and disjointed that I could not be asked to care anymore. I just wanted it to be over, and five minutes later I sat on my mat in tears and turned the video off. 

Since there is no audible cues I spent most of this flow a step or 2 behind, with my head tilted in uncomfortable angles to see the screen, or checking every 2 seconds to make sure I hadn't missed a transition. I could not for the life of me feel connected to the practice or to myself because I spent so much energy trying to keep up to someone I couldn't see or hear, and these workouts have been my ME time for the past month where I finish feeling exhausted after but so centered and proud of myself for pushing through.

546.0,Thank you so much Adriene for this 30 day challenge. Day 30 was my favourite - so much energy - I was able to keep up to you for just about all of it except for the elbow plank where you rotated side to side. It certainly was a challenge for me and I've noticed improvement in core strength and flexibility. Namaste!,UgwdPabYJRleT8sRPGl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-04-28T03:11:45Z,0.9997765421867371
547.0,"I am a bit late to the party, but still wanted to write this comment.
This was the first time I committed to something longer than 2 weeks! And while yes, go me, good job, I have Adriene to thank for this journey<3
For putting so much love, effort and compassion into each session.
I was watching them before I went to sleep everyday, so I couldn’t really comment on each episode, on all the moments she’d burst into songs, or walk “with an attitude”, or make funny jokes and then disregard them as if they weren’t funny:) I was cracking upxD 
& I really appreciated her being human:3
Especially the times, when right before I thought my hands can’t handle my weight anymore, she’d switch to another exercise❤️
I loved that it wasn’t about “pushing your limits”, but about showing up, being there for yourself and slowly building your strength🙌
I was bawling my eyes out during the last session, because I didn’t want this to end. And though yes, there  are lots of other videos, and it’s not really a goodbye, for a while there this felt like something real coming to an end:3  and to every “namaste” at the end I’d say “thank you Adriene”, and not hearing “namaste” on the last session broke my heart a little😅
I truly hope that this journey will mark the beginning of something great, because now I know that I cAn do something for myself every day. I just have to find the right thing and put less pressure on myself, because the hardest and the most important part is showing up;)",UgwPCHN_GQsXLRmbYg94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-04-28T00:18:05Z,0.9866129159927368

I’m a complete novice, aged 48 and overweight
I am a nurse and have found the last 12 months some of the hardest in my life
However I decided to start the 30 days of yoga on the 1st January 2021
I finished it today!!!  I know not the 30 days planned, but it’s 30 more days of yoga than I have ever done in my life!
About a month ago with growing confidence in myself I also started to eat healthier and have almost lost a stone
I feel good!

thank you very much for your patience and dedication. Such a nice way to start a day with your warm and bright energy. You are amazing. I love your vibes and the way you teach. 

I feel more energetic now and I am more motivated to practise yoga everyday.

I was surprised on day 30. But I understood later that it is your way to empower us and to let us listen to our own needs. 

If you have time, can you explain to us why we do the downward facing dog and how we should be doing it properly? You do it with so much grace!

33:59 where Adrienne smiles at the camera after that balance position like she is saying 'I told you you could do it'. Turns out she was right and I was able to do it. In fact I was surprised at how much I had learned ove the course of this yoga journey - the way I instinctively knew where she might go next, the way I was naming the positions in my head as I went along, the way I was aware of my form and knew how to breathe through the movements. 

I had a very moody day yesterday, just an off day which led into a lack of energy and will this morning but after doing this I felt so energised, refreshed. I moved through this morning with ease. It's now 10.20am and I am focussed and filled with clarity. 

I will forever be in a committed relationship with my yoga mat.

683.0,"Thank you Adriene for transforming my relationship with yoga. And, to all the people around the world who were part of this journey, I am proud of each and every one of you. I know stepping into the mat and be present took a little while to do, but you were able to do it nonetheless.

Thank you also, my dear self, for being gentle, encouraging, and strong. I will continue doing yoga, not for its grand poses, but for connecting with my breath and to be with myself.

Kudos to Adriene and your team for planning and producing every episode down to the core. And what more is that everything is free. You, guys, are the best!

(p.s. can i just say, I am slowly developing Adriene's nuances and sometimes I hear her speaking inside my head like ""Move where it feels good."" Damn, you are a legend, woman!)

689.0,"Wow, wow, wow! I did it! Total noobie to yoga. Day 1, my upper back muscles were so weak and tight that it hurt to do the sitting pose in prayer. My wrists hurt so bad they were on fire and I thought I can't do this, my body is too broken (cos of lockdown) Day 30 and my upper back feels stronger and my wrists don't hurt. I feel lighter, stronger, but what's incredible is how I feel about doing daily yoga. It's empowering and rewarding. I learnt discipline in BJJ but lockdown stole it from me. Yoga, this challenge, reminds me of what I'm capable of and to never let them get me down. To keep fighting and to keep moving, no matter what (depression). Thanks Adriene. Perfect intro to my Yoga journey. I WILL do daily Yoga in the AM. I plan to book privates to master basic fundamentals of Yoga as I do not want to injure my back and knees. Until then, I can do the basic poses I'm capable of and will, and i promise myself this, I will be able to stand on one leg (flat feet) by end of the year :D :D :D Congrats to anyone who managed to do the challenge!

696.0,"ADRIENE, GUYS, EVERYONE, I DID IT!!! When I started this practice (March 1st), for some reason I decided to really commit to doing it every day this time, even though I can hardly ever be that dedicated and consistent with anything. But I did it, 30 days of yoga in a row without missing a single day!!! I've been showing up even if when it was hard, even when I felt exhausted both emotionally and physically, I even created a personal encouragement for such days — ""Just roll the mat out and start the video, don't think about what's next"". It was always worth it, every single time.  And this last practice... It went so much better that the previous 30th day! I really did create my own practice, only peeking at the video now and then for more ideas or just to look at our beautiful mentor. I truly felt like I was meditating in motion, not just exercising. Thank you a million times, Adriene, for helping me transform and improve. Also, now I want to continue doing yoga more regulary — if not daily, then at least a few times each week. I love you.

I heard Adrien’s voice in my head and what she had taught me over the last 29 days even though I could not hear her. I felt connected. I have been trying out yoga for the last year, jumping from one session to another, never finding what I was looking for. I have learnt more in the last 30 days than in the last year.

Because I don't wear my glasses during practice my vision limits looking at the screen and an auditory cue would be helpful.  Finally, I would like to start another 30 day series.

864.0,Thank you for this wonderful journey. However I feel as though Day 30 undid the benefits of the previous 29. I could not relax and enjoy it because I was constantly watching to see the next move. At no point could I close my eyes and concentrate on my breathing.

Adriene, you make it easy to look forward to each lesson and I really enjoyed the email letters that came with each days practice and quote at the end.  Sadly, at 59, I wish I had tried yoga sooner.  Always thought it would be too slow and boring as my fitness has always been running, blading, cycling and hiking, etc.  Anything that brings me outdoors.  But the years of strenuous fitness activities have taken a toll on me physically.  Your class helped me so much.  Helped me to slow down and be kind to my body.  Learning the tools of breathing and stretching and posture, have spilled into other parts of my life and have brought calmness.  Your sense of humor cracks me up and having Benji there is so sweet.  I have a cattle dog of my own who loves to be near me when I practice.  Anyways, thank you, thank you, thank you for providing this to the community.  It was fun knowing I was practicing with others even in my own home.  I can't wait till I can try a practice a studio when it's safe.  I hear it is amazing.

i did find this last session difficult to follow though. it was a bit too quick and forced me to constantly check the screen to follow the sequence. i lost that beautiful sense of presence and focus on my movement. the focus was outwards and made feel a bit rushy. i believe it would work best to keep the meditative flow but use a few verbal cues. actually i think this could be a great idea for a series! 

lots of love darling Adriene.

I realise now I might have misunderstood the last session haha! I went exploring on my own and only looked up to get some guidelines from time to time. It might not have been what was intended, but it was so much fun (and terrifying) to improvise and follow my breath through everything you've taught us.

1000.0,I love these practices sooooo much and have been trying to do the 30 day challenge for years and never been able to complete it or stick to anything in my life. This is the first time I've ever made it the whole way through... it's the 5th of March but have been been doing Adrienes 10 minute sun salutations most days in between. I almost cried when I couldn't todays one... I started to feel panicy because I didn't know what to do so just sat there feeling badly. I couldn't come up with moves myself... which I know is my own fault... and I couldn't see what Adriene was doing because I have to take my glasses off during practice. I just really wanted to do this!!! : ( I feel a bit defeated. I know that is on me... just wished I could have been brave enough to get there : Z Not all of us have the same skill sets and some of us just aren't ready to go it alone. I trust I will in time... but yeah ... just wish I'd finished my first 30 day journey cos it meant a lot to me to do so.

I would like to say though that while I can appreciate you wanting to take a break from verbally guiding us, I found it extremely distracting to have to keep looking at the TV to see if you had moved on and to what pose.  I would appreciate it if you could just please name the pose you are transitioning into so that I can continue to participate while paying attention to my body instead of the tv.

I was really scared to start because I am overweight and I was terrified that I wouldn't be able to do poses correctly or be able to lift myself off the ground. The progress I've made with your help in these past few weeks has been tremendous, not only physically but mentally. I'm not scared to step on the mat anymore or try new poses. I allow myself to make mistakes and to try a pose in a different way that works for my body. I've begun to accept myself, ""flaws"" and all.

1024.0,"I started on Feb 1 because I was challenged (I know it's not the best frame of mind for this, but it got me to show up. That counts for something, right?) by dear friends of mine and finished yesterday.
This has been eye-opening for me. I have been a martial artist for most of my adult life and that was a journey to my strengths that I desperately needed in my life.
It also left a lot to be learned.
These past 30 days have been a journey to my weaknesses: my impatience, my inflexible hips, my short hamstrings, the clenched jaw... It was very exciting to be in a space where I felt welcome with how I am right now and where I get to explore without a need to arrive anywhere. It even allowed me to have fun with these weaknesses to an extend that I feel confident to engage with them in the future without getting discouraged by them.

Unsurprisingly the warrior poses have been my favorites, especially followed by the counter twist. My biggest achievement was finding a second of balance in crow that surprised me so much I lost it again. This last session I free-styled and I the hair on the back of my neck stand up with excitement about how nice everything was. I will keep on doing Yoga, probably dealing with lower back and hamstring first.

Side note, a friend and I have been wondering throughout the series... 🤔what is the blueish/dark structure behind you in the yard. Is it a fence? Tarp? A shadow? Retaining wall?

And once I got started and realised quite quickly that indeed I could, the tears came. As a bonus, I was just lifting my hands to my head, lips and heart (for the right thoughts, words and deeds/feelings) when the video closed. Thank you for this wonderful 30-day journey.

1156.0,"As a former yoga instructor, I really enjoyed this series! My daughter in-law got me to do it as a challenge with her. Just to add to Adriene's amazing teaching, I would like to add a little encouragement. To those of you who had trouble doing a class with no verbal instruction, I understand. However, A is trying to teach you the very important aspects of a home practice. The name of this series, BREATH, is so true. Breath connects your body, mind and spirit. It helps you get through the more challenging poses and it keeps you in the moment. If nothing else, breathe! That is the most important thing. Next, FEEL; you notice how A stops for moments throughout the practice just to check in on how she is feeling. Tune in to your body! Lastly, Trust. You may not be able to do everything in the course. See how you feel and do something else that your body is prompting you to do. It is YOUR yoga practice! Listen to your body and just go with the flow. I have had wrist tendonitis throughout this course so Plank Pose and Face Down Dog were out. I either adapted the poses by going onto my forearms or I stayed in Childs Pose or I just did what I felt like doing! When it's a home practice feel free to do whatever your body tells you to do.
Lastly, Adriene, it was a real pleasure to take this journey with you. I do a lot of your classes. You have a beautiful way of explaining things in a clear fashion that is also soulful. I picked up a lot of nifty variations that are so much fun! Thank you and keep up the great work! Namaste, Susan",UgxFzuAqy5oPojwGR494AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-25T18:33:45Z,0.9992471933364868

I can’t believe it I did it 
Thank you so much Adriene 😘
Finally I did yoga I was afraid of it and I was procrastinating it , now I did 50 minutes from it I can’t believe it 
Thank you again 
I notice a lot of advantages from it not only 
Improving my flexibility, I became more awareness in the moment , less anxious, and I learnt how I breath and I relax , and improve my ankle and knee after a years from injury I was recovering from it but no like with yoga at was another else for me 
Thank you so much

1199.0,"Wow. What an accomplishment for everyone who made it to this day! And thank you Adriene for being our teacher and guiding light thru it all. I really learned that it's ok to start off a little rocky, missing days yet you can always come back in. Around day 12 was when I finally set in my mind to stay with it and stay consistent - just showing up to the mat is an accomplishment (of course we all know what happens when you get there!). The second most important thing - ""my breath is my anchor."" I really appreciated that mantra and find it very useful. Physically, I'm a big, tall guy and very inflexible. I loathe sitting crosslegged and especially getting on the floor. So my intention for my practice is to change that, to get comfortable with these motions. It's part of my culture, my son loves when I come to play on the floor with him, and I paint murals for a living so I'm always having to be on the floor. This 30 day journey has been a blessing for me. I'm more flexible, more calm, and feel more centered.

To everyone who experienced frustration at the silence and wished there were cues, I totally get it, I had the same reaction my first 30 days of Yoga which was in 2018.  I remember stopping the video and doing a different one instead because I couldn't 'keep up' and 'get it right'.  If I'm honest I felt a little cheated!  I've continued to do at home yoga with Adriene since and my experience of the final practice in January 2020 and this one in 2021 is so different.  I start slowly, making my own flow and then glance at the screen when I can for ideas of flows or poses to move into in a few minutes.  I love that I can create a whole practice for myself with a little inspiration from Adriene and I absolutely see and believe in the rationale for doing it this way!

1236.0,It took me 50 days to do this 30 day challenge. I have such a hard time with perfectionism and was afraid that not completing every single session the day it was realized would give me anxiety and lead to me giving up as soon as I missed a day (which was inevitable as a person with a small child and a baby and a full time job). I even talked to a therapist about this and she said why do you have to do 30 days of yoga in 30 days? I felt like such a dummy. I'm so proud of myself for completing this journey!!!

It’s incredible, I truly have no words. It’s amazing how one person can create such thing like this. Everyday, I’m doing yoga on my mat, alone, but I never feel alone. I feel supported, I feel connected, I feel stronger. I’m so so grateful that I discovered this. I’m a vocal coach and I’m telling all my singing students how I’m such a fan of “Yoga with Adriene”. The connection of the mind, body and voice is so strong, so I’ve already started thinking about implementing yoga in my singing classes.

i'm feeling very emotional right now because this journey has come to an end. it's especially emotional because this is the first 30 day journey i've completed since 2017! there have been a lot of difficult things and I had lost trust in myself to commit to a practice, but I wanted to prove to myself that i was capable, and I did! it took a bit longer, but i'm proud of myself for completing the full 30 days! i'm especially proud because this was the first time i was able to go with my own flow without hanging around waiting for Adriene to tell me what to do next. even though the 50 minutes was daunting at first, i ended up needing extra time at the end!
it's been a pleasure practicing with you all, and I'm honoured to have Adriene (and Benji) as my guide and safe place. here's to trusting ourselves, and trusting the process. it's worth it. you're worth it.

But with your reassurance and all the tools you taught along the way I stopped doubting myself and just trusted that I could:) I even shed a few tears during my meditation because of how grateful I was for dedicating the time and effort to myself for 30 days to start prioritizing my overall health.

1297.0,"I remember stumbling upon this channel a couple of years ago and trying to do yoga... and failing miserably, hating myself every step of the way. Blaming myself for not sticking to routine etc. 
Now I understand that then wasn't the right time for me. 
Last year I started my journey of self love and radical self acceptance. It isn't easy and not every day is great, but I'm still here! So it's a win! 
I did this 30 day journey from place of self love and, most importantly, self acceptance. Adriene's words helped me so much through this month and a half (I took breaks:) ) and today was surprising! No guidance! It was so interesting and freeing letting my body flow freely. By the end of the practice I am filled with such joy and love! And surprising sense of unity? Of being a part of something bigger and better. Feeling the world around me.
It was like coming home. Like a warm hug.

1303.0,"2 weeks late with a few days' break for an injury (not YWA-related lol), and when I first heard this was gonna be an almost hour long one I thought I'd never make it through. Even during the opening bit, when she said it was okay if we laid on the mat the whole time, I thought that would be me for the last half of it at least. 

Did I stumble a couple times? Yep. Did I fall out of the one-legged poses a couple times? Heck yeah I did. 

But did I hold out to the end, even when I was sure my forehead sweat was making my mat slippery during child's pose? Why yes, yes I did. And did I also hold crow pose for longer than I ever had before? Hell yes I did.

Thank you, Adriene. After this 30 days, I feel stronger, healthier (mentally and physically), and more centered than I have in... years? decades? Ever? I can't decide.

1311.0,"Adriene, oh I have got so many things to tell you about. In 2020 I decided to create my own bucket list. Mostly because of things that happened in the world. I realized that I have so many things that I want to do but I have never done. One of them was yoga practice, two weeks straight, at least two weeks. Also in October 2020 I started my first year at uni. And it was the whole emotional rollercoaster. By the end of that year I felt blue nearly everyday. I felt like I was living in the nightmare. Stress and depression were literally my close friends. I thought that I was hopeless, that I can do nothing. I had big dreams that I thought I would never make come true. And that was a time when I noticed that you have just started this yoga journey. It was a sign for me. I joined this journey 30 days ago. Now I'm here, after all of the journey, feeling so good. You helped me, when I thought that nobody can help me. Yoga taught me not giving up. There was many poses that I had to struggle with but even though I tried. Also I noticed how my body strength improved. Now I'm starting to love my body again. And loving myself. I'm proud of myself because I HAVE TRIED. If something is not for me, if I did it wrong I'm not mad, because I know that I did my best. Yoga helped me with feeling down, with my anger issues and show me that I can do everything, but I need to trust myself. Thank you so much for this journey. When I saw that day 30 is 50 minutes long and without your advices, I thought that I won't do it. I literally panicked because I thought I'll do something wrong. I did it without any break. When I collapsed, I told myself that I'm doing great and came back to the practice. After these beautiful 30 days, I know that I'll stay with you longer. I'll definitely check your other yoga journeys. Maybe it's time for Home? 
It supposed to be just two weeks but you show me the beauty of this practice and made me fell in love with yoga. Thank you so much for just being yourself 💕

It is day 30 for US, and the place you lay your mat may look different, but it’s the same above the mat.



The world may have been hard during these 30 days.  Maybe you wanted to quit.  Maybe you did, but then came back.  Maybe this was easy.  Maybe it was hard.  Maybe you should just sit on your mat and think how awesome you are for making it.


I know that when I walk away from this laptop and enjoy my final day right now, I will sit on my mat and think how thankful I am to Adriene.  I may have thought you were bending me like a pretzel, but you really have changed my life and I can’t thank you enough for that.

Then I re read the comments and changed my mindset, I didn’t need to copy Adriene - she was my guide  who I could follow if I wished but I could also just go with the flow and follow what I wanted to do.

So I did and enjoyed it. I could often here Adriene’s voice in my head from the 3 years of yoga with Adriene.

I will return back to this session again.

I find that this sort of video just makes me look at the screen more than usual because I don't know when you've moved onto a new pose.

I wasn’t consistent every single day, but it was the perfect one for me because this year my main goal is to practice more self love and I always remember Adriene asking the question “what if your breath was your spirit?” That always felt true to me and if that’s true than this was the best practice for self love as I got more in time with my spirit. 
I gotta say this nearly hour long kind of freestyle with no guidance really was uncomfortable and awesome! It helped me listen to me.

I'd dome all of them up to day 27 without a break, and I'd been so proud, but then life happened and I'd fallen of track. I worked hard to remind myself yoga is about finding what feels good, about choosing every day what's best for me and not some perfect score, but a part of me was still disappointed. today I came back to this last practise, and as soon as I sat down in the mat, I started crying. The following 50 minutes I just spent with myself, paying attention to what my body and mind needed. it felt so cleansing, so healing.

1465.0,"To everyone who's struggling without voice cues and has their experience ruined by looking at the screen: you're not supposed to! If you can't do it on your own, you've missed all the lessons of the previous practices. But if you trust yourself and try, you might find that you can do much more than you think! Just breathe and move. Everything you need is already in you <3

On my first 30-day challenge finale, I was also annoyed and frustrated at the lack of vocal instruction. But now, a few years of daily yoga later, I look forward to it because I really do have the vocabulary, creativity and trust to simply listen to my body and find what feels good. I've already been ""veering off the railroad tracks"" and doing yoga with eyes closed lately, and I don't need the voiceover because I can hear Adriene in my head anyway, even off the mat. But this time I made the practice completely my own, with lions instead of dogs, deeper focus in certain poses that I'm normally too distracted to truly enjoy and an involuntary pause in the middle because the HOME theme song made me cry, of course. I ended up just staring at the screen for a while, mesmerized by Adriene's gracefulness and finding new motivation to keep going because I want to be like that someday.

Thank you so much for letting me come along for this journey, and all the people in the comments creating the most wholesome community on youtube. I'm so happy to be a part of it.
Keep Breathing.

I reflected on where I started inactive and battling depression. Now I’m down 7lbs and losing inches. I’m stronger and much more disciplined.

I often couldn't understand the words , until today.
Today's practice, I surprised No words. But, Adrien said we have a ""Vocabulary"". It was truth. We did it! We had gotten the vocabulary through 29 days journey. I impress this thing. It is a big awareness. So, I trying now, also English too.

1494.0,"As someone who is new to yoga and was learning a lot throughout this process, I was really disappointed in this video. I don't know if the intention was for us to improvise or to somehow be able to follow along without audio but I found it incredibly frustrating as someone who doesn't quite have the vocabulary yet to create my own flow.

I appreciate the knowledge and the guidance so not trying to be too negative or anything but I really think if this is being geared towards beginners, keeping the cues in is a good idea. How am I supposed to know what is happening on the screen? Is there some yoga secret I am missing? A TV built into the floor of my mat? 

I don't know, I just found this last one to be frustrating and it was sad for me to end such a positive and fruitful journey on such a flustered and confused note.",Ugxh5f7zPsLLxXU-Uq54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-02-12T02:15:14Z,-0.9897331595420837

1585.0,"Man, all I can say is thank you, Adriene. Of all of your 30 day journeys, this is the one I feel I grew the most over the course of the 30 days. Not just physically (although I did find the bravery and ambition to add in a few more push-ups and stick with those core exercises a little bit longer 😋), but as we went along I found myself not just saying ""I am brave"" or ""I am worthy"" or ""I love myself"" but actually believing it. I was spending a lot more time checking in with myself physically, mentally, and emotionally. To my surprise, I ended up really finding that connection to center on day 18 that has stuck with me to the end. And, appropriate for the name Breath, this journey was where I really feel like my connection to my breath stuck with me through most of the practices. I don't know where the road will take me next, but I'm excited to find out! Thank you again, Adriene.

1591.0,"This was probably the most challenging and life changing 30 day yoga challenge of all but I am so glad I made it through with y'all!  Around day 16, I fell down some stairs and hurt my knees, hip, and ankle. However, I didn't take a break, I pulled through. I couldn't follow the challenge at that point because I couldn't do the table top position. So, I just did my own little yoga sessions with things I was able to do without causing more pain. After a couple of days, I was able to continue the challenge. So, I technically finished this on day 37. Now, I feel the urge to continue the streak and see how far I can make it. I hope by sharing this some people feel encouraged to keep going even if life throws all kinds of things at you. Sometimes I had to do yoga just before bedtime because I was too busy all day and other days I had a hard time motivating myself.

A few times, I was looking at the video and once to my surprise, I was doing the same pose as you by accident. The other times, I was looking for inspiration :D This last session was also really helpful in respect to perceiving this yoga as self care and me time instead of a challenge (and I really needed this as I sometimes get a little bit too competitive). Thank you very, very much again.

1649.0,"This was one of the most special practices I've ever did. I was caught surprised when you let us “find what feels good” and I thought I shouldn't do it because I didn't feel ready for this kind of yoga. But I dared to try, to blend with your music and sequence. 
Firstly, it was real yoga. I did those asanas I knew and put myself into this completely. Although we were doing various asanas, I was really pleasant when I looked on the screen and saw you were doing the same exercise that me! This feels incredible for some reason, a gentle flow of our unification. 
Secondly, when I did all of those dynamic moves, I started to perform the lighter ones. Lying on the back, noticing my breath, playing with my feets... Essentially, this act turned out to be fully meditative and my mind was like still water during this. I felt like the threads between me and my surroundings, things around me were synchronised and we were acting from the same natural way that lies at the foundation of everything. 
Thirdly... After my meditation, my mind began to rise and bloom with colourful light. I felt waves of inspiration breezing on me, filling my imagination with creative energy like they easily flow into my mind. This was really important for me because I am a novice author and I am going to compose books, so this inspiration gave me answers and keys to the questions about my world building that bothered me for a long time. 
I noted I became more flexible, tranquil, stronger... This day I could grab my toes in the those asana where we lie on the legs and reach for them but not curving them. Also, I paid attention I could get into the ""happy baby"" pose and feel completely comfortable in comparison that I couldn't do at the beginning...
...beginning. Each conclusion is another start. When I started, I was inexperienced and open for knowledge you offered, now I know a lot of exercises and have some experience at yoga. Essentially... I realised now I am at the new beginning of something even further, my personal practices and new attribute to yoga. Before I have always been doing it with your guidance and I felt incredible but today... With the freedom you shared with us, I composed something new, my own sequence. Today is the switch between those times. And I got ""each ending is another opening"" means we exist in continuous process of moving from one point of present into another one. 
I greatly appreciate your journey you guided us through and cleared our minds for something greater up ahead. Thank You for Your gifts You gave us we will never forget and will always keep it in our hearts. Namaste. 💜💚",UgyKLvbBv1lFGH7YmMt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-08T17:36:24Z,0.8254027445461907

I lost myself in this practice and the music was incredible. The music starting at 41:16 resonates with me as it was played in the first-ever Yoga With Adriene video I watched back in 2018 from Day 10 of her 30 days of yoga series in 2015. I watched that video so many times before I ventured into others and was from then I became a fan. Finally at the end of the practice as I lay on the floor,r a big smile crept on my face as the soundtrack for this entire 30 days started to play. Adriene, you truly are a powerful woman.

I have been exploring for a few years now with you Adriene from the days of Revolution all the way to Breath and all the videos in between, (it's been a few years). I don't have the words my darling to say exactly how I felt at the end of this practice, the nostalgia when I heard the themes from the practices over the years and the challenges I faced over the years whilst practicing with you til today. The theme from 'Home' almost made me cry so I was already a bit tender, but when we got to the end, whilst lying in Shavasana, everything came pouring out, love joy, sorrow, pride all of it. Adriene, thank you, from my great soul to your great soul, thank you. This post was long but is goes a very tiny way to explain how grateful I am for you and the community..

1773.0,"I started this on the first along side everyone else, and it’s was so amazing and beautiful. I missed a few days in between due to feel sick or exhausted, and even though I was two days behind I felt strong and amazing. Towards the end of the challenge I had to miss two more days and I felt devastated, I wanted to show up every day, I felt disappointed in myself. I came to finally finish the challenge today, and I knew the no mic was coming. I came with low mood, as I was sad to finish today and not when I initially intended, but as soon as it started I decided to do my own thing, only sometimes looking for inspiration. It was life changing. I’ve done the other challenges and always strained to follow Adriene, but today I just did what feels good. Looked at the clouds and blue skies, the flower in my yard, and breathe. I didn’t want it to end! I kept extending it. I felt powerful, and I knew I was meant to do this today. As I cried at the end I said out loud “ I am powerful. I am worthy. I accept where I am today and I am proud of myself. This challenge will be important to me for the rest of my life, and I can’t wait to do it again. Thank you adriene for this gift. I love you. I love joining everyone with this practice!

1785.0,"I just finished Breath today and I’d like to share my deepest gratitude. I’ve always had a negative relationship with exercise and my body. I used it as a punishment, and so I’ve never been able to cultivate a regular routine or a good relationship with myself. I was always down on myself for not meeting a certain standard, not being strong enough, etc. And then a friend recommended YWA. Adriene, the way you carry yourself through this practice helped me see that working out or using my body was not a punishment, but a gift. You don’t TELL us to do things, you INVITE us. And those invitations showed me how to communicate with myself in a nurturing way. So when we got to corpse pose, I just started crying, because for the first time in my LIFE, I’ve been able to show up for my body every single day in a positive way, and watch myself become stronger without any other emotion other than LOVE for who I am and where I am on my journey. This was my first YWA 30 days, but tomorrow I start HOME. Because in many ways, I have finally found home within myself.",UgwYX19T9eUztW4ckXZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-06T15:56:04Z,0.9940209984779358

I find myself moving more consciously this month, paying attention to where my body is and how it is working together and with my breath.

1797.0,"I found this practice the most challenging of the month. I did it 6 days late, and nearly skipped it completely. I thought I'd be lost without a guiding voice, and at times I was. I ended up going off the ""script"" and feeling my way through, with a stiff body and period pains to navigate. And by 30 minutes, I'd exhausted myself by going through lots of positions (maybe) too quickly. So I just lay still for the last 20 minutes and focused on accepting my own journey and resting my tired body and mind. Very interesting experience!

I had some difficulty keeping up, because my job and life in general can be so exhausting and overwhelming, that it felt like my body wasn't capable to do anything more than to go to work on some days. And on other days, I learnt that yoga is the exact thing I need when I am exhausted.

1805.0,"I´m sure nobody will read this, since I was a little late to this challenge; today was my last day. And I feel like I need to say how much of an emotional rollercoster this whole journey was. Especially today. 

When I heard I will do this on my own I felt so lost. And the music sounded so so sad. I thought I won´t make it. or at least not without crying half of the time. At this point I need to say that I have a huge problem with ending things; no matter what! Could be a video game too. So that was a surprise that I made it that far in first place.
Anyways. I felt lost at the beginning and tend to look up every few seconds. Than I heard Adrienes voice in my head from the other days and began to breath, relax and slowly find my rhythm. It was such a great feeling! And I can´t say how greatful I am to say: I´ve made it!

But as I realized the familiar music in the end I began to tear up... man... I wish I could start again. I mean I can, but it´s time for the next journey.

And what makes this one stand out from the rest, for me, is that this is the first time I've ever committed and completed something like this. My goal, when I started this, was just to be able to prove to myself that I could be disciplined enough to finish this journey. How little I knew back then about how much more I would learn, feel, and embrace in these thirty days. I am so thankful. 
It felt so affirming to put all the vocabulary and tools in place, and to trust myself to find what feels good and lean into it.

1821.0,"I have seen several comments that are critical of this practice without the guidance of Adriene's voice, and I totally see where your fear and discomfort comes from. But I thought I would add a comment for those coming to this video for the first time who may be scared away by those comments. After doing the 30 days, I promise you are capable of doing this practice without her voice. She follows the same patterns that she has for the past 29 days, so you will certainly be able to follow her flow, only checking in every so often. It also feels so liberating and empowering to do what feels good for you too! It feels so good that I can do movements that feel good for me, then meet Adriene back in the next downward dog and continue back with her when I'm ready. It takes trust in yourself to do this flow without her guidance, but if you honour the principles of the past month of moving from your center, trusting yourself, doing what feels good, etc., you will find value in this. For those feeling a bit lonely in this practice, I totally see that and you are valid, but I also think it's so nice to just simply do yoga along side her, rather than trying to copy what she does. I would put your laptop somewhere high, like a desk or bed, so you can easily look up and see her. I felt amazing after this, and you will too!",UgxrfLtI0-YtOiorDEB4AaABAg,1.0,7.0,2021-02-06T01:03:59Z,0.9993991851806641

Yoga was the only thing I could do that that helped in my small space. During these 30 days I have moved to a happier home for now and will continue to take these mindsets with me.

besides the breath, im also really happy to say that ive felt myself getting stronger and my mobility has definitely gotten better. before breath, i was able to touch just my fingertips to the ground while doing forward fold, but i now can almost touch up to my palms on the ground! my calves have also started unlocking. i used to dread downward facing dog, but i dont anymore. my arms, back, core, legs....everything got better! again, thank you so much adriene!",UgzSVbl_S9rAsUuqqq94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-05T18:28:53Z,0.9929226636886597

The length of this video was daunting, I'll admit, and even more daunting was finding out I wasn't getting any audio directions. But I'm proud of myself! I made it through 35 minutes of guiding myself, just listening to the music and hardly looking at Adriene. I found my mind wandering more than usual without that guide there but I brought myself back to my breath and sometimes I could even hear Adriene's voice in my head. I never ever thought I would guide myself through a practice but I just did!!

1942.0,"Thank you Adriene for prompting me to realize that I know much more than I sometimes think I do. I  was surprised at how the simple reminder to myself of ""breathe in, breathe out"" was most constant as I practiced, more than body cues, and that that was all I needed to keep moving. The movements sort of happened on their own. My other reminder to myself, during the second half, was ""I'm strong."" I needed those reminders today, and every day. I've never done a daily yoga practice but I've known deeply that it would be nourishing. I am going to use this inspiration, along with the strength and commitment I experienced this month, as fuel to continue to begin again each day. It's been good Adriene, very good.

The last months and especially January were not easy for me, and as I used to love my own practice, this last months I really needed your guidance. I picked a video every day since October. It felt very comforting to be guided by your voice. This last day of the journey, I was able to make my own movements again. You taught me so much this 30 days. Sometimes I peeked at the screen and saw you were doing the same, a few seconds before or after me, which felt like we were doing a dance, haha. I really loved the music, it helped me to get in my body and in the flow. Peeking at you, seeing you doing your own practice, gave a great unity feeling. Also realizing the fact a few 100 or 1000 other yogi's practicing along with me.

2004.0,"I finished my ""30 days"" today, February 3rd. It was an honor to do this class and really connect with breath, myself, and feel a part of something special, good, and healthy shared with stranger friends from around the world. As I did the last class with Adriene, I heard her voice in my head: ""root to rise"", ""breathe love in, breathe love out"", and ""find what feels good"" at different moments. I followed Adriene and did some of my own thing too. My crow didn't get off  the ground, but felt strong and with more of my body engaged than in the last 30 plus years of practice. I've worked with a lot of yoga teachers and learned something from every one, but Adriene is my favorite, this lifetime, so far.

2059.0,"I am not gonna lie, it was not an easy final chapter for me as I found it difficult to practice just on my own for 50 minutes. For half of the time, I kept peeking at the screen, hurting my neck, forgetting about my breath and then.... I just decided to screw it and let it flow. Let my breath guide me to find what feels good as I remembered that was the purpose. And that's when I started to fully appreciate this practice. Yes, it was challenging. But it also made me feel incredibly empowered because I felt like I truly knew what I was doing - simply building on everything the last year with Adrienne and this 30 days journey taught me.

Getting used to a certain way of practice for 29 days and then bam, it's different in the very last day it just made me uncomfortable. What is the point of having this marvellous teacher if she doesn't guide you? I guess I'm a creature of habit and will find the answer after a few more 30 days journeys with Adriene.

Always a challenge to go without guidance, to listen not to your confident voice but to our doubtful minds and bodies, to find what feels good for us, for as many breathes as we need not as you cue... a very humbling and powerful experience.

2119.0,"Adriene, thank you so much! 
I did the 30 day challenge last year and it got me into doing yoga (almost) everyday for the whole year. Before that experience I never new what a difference it makes to practice daily instead for longer sessions once or twice a week. And how much easier :-) and way more transformative for body and mind it is! 
Last year on day 30 I followed your every move and was so proud to do that without your voice. 
This year I am even more proud and touched because I flowed freely, found what feels good (a little tree dance for example) and only glanced at you doing yoga beside me from time to time. 
I think this is the part of your work I am most thankful for, that you teach how to feel and enable others to do yoga or any other movement on their own according to their own needs. 
And what a cool thing to practice alongside so many people from all over the world.

I do the whole month and then I can’t do the final video, which is usually the best one! PLEASE, Adrienne, consider doing it with cues in the future.

2143.0,"Thanks Adriene you have given us so much and so many tools to work with.  I admittedly felt a little frustrated in this last class b/c I had a very hard time following along  in my living room (aka ""gym"") without your voice guiding me.  I have learned, through your guidance, to trust enough to just listen to your voice and not necessarily watch you, but this time I had to keep twisting my head to see and felt like I was scrambling the whole time.  Despite that, I have extremely enjoyed all of your kind, gentle guidance and cueing and while I could often hear your voice in my head telling me to breathe and relax and to let go of that which doesn't serve you,  I'll admit that especially in the resting poses, I kept popping up to look - ""what are we doing now"" loll  Thanks for spoiling us and giving us your gifts of guidance so graciously throughout these 30 days.

2145.0,"I am a bit late adding my comment, but just wanted to thank you Adriene for this 30 day journey. I have followed along each day and found myself gently challenged and encouraged. I am still not able to get my feet off the ground for the crow pose and I suspect it might be some time yet before I do! But while I still sometimes lose my balance, I feel stronger, calmer and a real sense of accomplishment to have followed this through. This final session is always a challenge for me as I find your voice guidance during the class so beneficial to keeping my flow. I understand that it's to help us begin to see we can guide our own session or journey, however at this stage in my yoga journey I miss the vocal guidance. BUT, I was pleased to learn that I have grown on my journey and was able to lead myself along for a good while before having to resort to peeking for inspiration! Throughout the practice I could actually hear in my head little phrases you use, most of all 'remember to breathe'! I genuinely felt quite emotional when the closing music began as this has been such a great comfort and inspiration at a challenging time for us all. It has given me structure and focus...and time to breathe.

About 1/2 way through I went a little rogue and “found what felt good” to me. Then 3/4 through, my husband was done, so he picked up the mic and guided me verbally based on what Adriene was doing. 😆

2243.0,"I absolutely loved this month Adriene, thank you! I've done a few 30 day series with you now and have loved each one! I have to say I struggle with Day 30 of each though... Maybe I'm missing the intent here, but I don't get into the flow like I do with the regular classes where I can just close my eyes and listen for your cues. With this one I'm craning my neck every 10 seconds to see where you're at and what you're doing so that I may keep up and get the most out of the order of things. I would prefer an audio only class vs visual only for the last one. Unless of course it was something we worked towards, like a specific practiced or memorized flow, where we're just doing it side by side. The mic-off instruction doesn't make sense to me.

I still tried to follow along with the video for the most part but there were times when I guided myself... after our 29 days of practice some of it started to stick.

I will defiantly try to keep doing yoga. Also the tightness around my shoulders has been gone since first week, so that amazing. But I must admit that this last practice was quite a challenge for me, because of the missing introductions. Usually I will just close my eyes and follow your voice, so I can let everything out, and just do the patrice.

I have never considered myself especially talented or creative, I cant dance, paint draw play a musical instrument. but what happened here was remarkable.  I found myself just wanting to flow with the music, incorporating the yoga moves, kind of following what you were doing, but just going with my body, I was a ballet/latin/indie/tai chi dancer, just interpreting the music and expressing through movement what has happened in my life, what is happening in my life, gratitude for all that I have  .    I was certainly curious today, I found something I did not know was there.   Thank you for all that you have taught me for the past 7 years.

2309.0,"Oh gosh! As I started this video I thought, in quick succession, 
""I don't have time for this.. I'll just do part.""
""I will always look back and either know I did it, or I didn't do it. I'd prefer to know I did it.""
""If I don't do this now, doing a 50 minute yoga session will become an additional thing on my to do list.""

I did the whole thing.

It was very interesting to have no talking. I enjoyed being able to follow my breath better by not having to think about the vocal directions and incorporate them in. I did lose my breath as I was wrapped up in my family's recent judgments about my four year old (and I suppose my parenting). But I .. feel like the yoga and movement worked me through it? By the end I reached the conclusion (for now), that judgment is ignorance, and the antithesis (I believe I heard a monk once say), is observation. And I am upset because I feel judgements direct behaviours and become self-fulfilling-prophecies, however, I can still sift through people's judgements for any true observations, and take those and TRY to leave the rest behind / try not to engage. 

That thought cyclone, I feel, would have been a lot more painful and effortful if I hadn't been doing yoga at the time. I look forward to signing up for the next 30 day challenge. And will be adding instructionless yoga to me, 'things to do while pondering issues' list!",UgxZkENLl9nNLu2-f0B4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-02T11:26:52Z,-0.9901178479194641

2360.0,"I can't thank you enough Adriene, although todays practice was a little bit different, it was so empowering. I was brought to tears just 10 minutes in as I lead my own practice. Realizing how much I have learned, how much I have taught myself, and how much I have grown over these past few transformative months for myself. I loved the freedom of listening to what my body and soul wanted with each movement, and I could catch myself in so many poses correcting myself ""pull the left hip crease back"" ""square the hips"" ""inhale lots of love in, exhale lots of love out"" ""relax the skin of the face"". You have taught us so much, I'm so grateful for you and your team for all that you do. Thank you Adriene, Namaste:)",UgzB-oz5gtGLTaDA42t4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-02T03:30:23Z,0.9997450709342957

No, I'm proud because this year marks my 4th time doing a YWA journey, but it is the first year that I do it entirely. One video per day every single day. And I understood how much it is important to do it like that. The change in my internal system (not just the physical body the whole thing) is so remarkable! I'm impressed, and so glad to have do so.

2418.0,"To be honest, I almost didn't do it today. It was a long practice and I was really tired from the day, it's been raining for 2 full days (which is weird here in the summer) some places are flooded and I had to go to the office. But I did it and I'm lowkey amazed. I got through all the practice without falling like a sack of potatoes, when at the start I could barely hold a plank pose with my muscles all weak and unused after my breast reduction surgery.

2425.0,"Oh Adriene thank you so much for this wonderful resource that you have created i am super grateful for your guidance. I first found your channel back in 2015 and I was a yoga wannabe but I only motivated myself to do maybe a couple of sessions a year. Then in later years I've attended a few classes irl, did your video here and there but it kind of wasn't sticking or wasn't regular and then I stopped altogether. I then got a desk job in 2019 and my back was gradually getting more and more painful. I knew I had to do something so last spring I started doing some basic stretches  for 15min each morning and that already helped. Then I finally did some therapy and ayahuasca which I think helped release some old patterns and helped Reconnect back with my body and since then I've been able to stick to a daily practice! I've switched from my basic stretches to your videos daily back in mid November and km on it since. Might have skipped a day here or there but not frequently. I just completed your 30 day challenge (seemed unachievable even a year ago) and I think I find comfort in a daily practice now and made it a habit, I hope. I also find a lot of comfort in hearing your guiding voice and having your gentle presence on screen (love your random singing too). So thank you so much again because my recent achievement wouldn't be possible without you. 🙏🏼 Virtual hugs 🤗

But, I decided this morning to do the practice despite my hesitations, I did all the other 29 days, I should ""trust"" myself more to do well, and ""believe"" that I can stay committed the whole length of the practice - after all, the first practice was nearly so long, so I put my mind to this practice, and let me just say - I'm so glad I did, this was one of the most wonderful practices I've ever done. I don't know what I was so afraid of, I had all the skills and tools I needed, and when I fell, literally or figuratively, I returned to my breath and returned to my pose. I felt that Adriene and everyone else practicing was there with me the whole way and it was truly beautiful. I feel like I have such a deeper love for myself and my breath after this journey, and this practice in particular.

It was too stressful as we did not have your voice to guide us. Yes, I agree that we have learned the language and it makes it much easier, but I did not know what was coming after the poses. Here is an example, if we were doing underdog, I did not know what was next or how long we were supposed to stay because I could not see my computer from that position. Same when I was in a twist position or on a standing position.

I have endless gratitude for you, Adriene and your work. I'm right in the middle of a breakup, the peak time where sometimes you feel like you can't breathe, and the whole first half I was openly and wildly weeping through the practice. I keep waking up in the middle of the night with those great big aching pains reminding me that my person is no longer my person. But every breath allowed me to move with grace through every tear, and by the time warrior came around, I felt strong and whole. 

I keep telling myself that I'm going to get through this, and now I believe it. I am strong. In the same way I don't have to look down anymore because I know the earth is there for me, I'm a little less afraid of moving forward on my own, because I know that this and my breath will always be there for me.

Moreover, during Shavasana, the tears came with a powerful emotional release which I welcomed with open heart.

2477.0,"I've been doing yoga for years, but this is my first time doing yoga every single day for a whole month and I'm having trouble believing how my body and my relationship to it has changed in these short weeks. I'm completely shocked at how much more flexible and strong I am and how I can feel and see the physical proof of that during and after the daily practices. I'm also no longer getting frustrated with what my body can't do. This is my body and it is capable of great things and I don't get angry when I can't reach, hold, or balance because I revel in what my body CAN do. Adriene, I cannot begin to express how much I love the way you teach and guide yoga. You take your job seriously, while also bringing a great playfulness and lightness to the practice that I've needed greatly. Today felt so incredible practicing alongside Adriene and I felt for the first time that I could completely trust my body and trust my breath. I could go on, but anyway, thank you to everyone involved in this journey. I've already printed out the February calendar to continue practicing daily with my best friend, who joined me halfway through this journey and previously said she thinks she'd hate yoga and yet she now loves it.

2499.0,"Thanks for this beautiful challenge! It helped me so much through the month, to show up for myself. I am going to therapy as I am trying to navigate trough life with past trauma, and doing yoga helped me to breath and be present when I do something challenging. This year has been tough with covid and the challenges I took but it's so worth it. I'd like to share my thoughts as I was doing this practice and I was a little bit lost in my head, I noticed something. As I was stretching and looking at my knee I saw an old scar, that was made when I was 5 years old and fell on a rock. The memory of it is so fresh, it's like it was yesterday, but there were no pain and no rock left. My past traumas feel like many scars, but it's like I still carry these rocks with the memories too attached from it. Like I can feel the weight and the anxiety. I think I never let go of these rocks. I'm still learning but I think I just got one important lesson guys, I can stop trying to fix myself. All this time I just had to let go, don't pressure myself to do well but instead just be myself, with kindness and good intention. I think I was trying to protect myself from what could go wrong but it no longer serves me. Maybe in a near future I can let go of these heavy rocks, and even if the scars are still there, and I still remember how it got there, I no longer feel it, and I will move past that.",Ugz8EW-smCNGVX5nJcR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-01T19:39:55Z,0.9959415793418884

I don't have the ability of putting this into better words: thank you so much, Adriene (and Benji), what you do is truly a gift to so many people, I put so much faith into these 30 days, I felt so lost before, and they weren't at all what I expected, and from the bottom of my heart I feel so grateful for them, for what's coming.

I will say, after my first 30 day journey a few months ago, I was so frustrated at the silent long practice and made a comment saying as such. I come forward now, humbly apologizing. Now that I know what to do with a bit more confidence, this practice was amazing. I still peeked every once and a while to get an idea of what sequence to do next. But most of the time, my body knew what to do, my breath anchored me and kept me from hurrying along to try and keep up with Adrienne. And by the end I was emotional in a completely different way! It really is a process and a journey and I wish I had understood that earlier. But everything in it's time. Thanks so much to Adrienne and everyone who came along!

""But I don't wanna fly!""
And. Because my Chromecast wasn't working all I had was my phone, and it's difficult to follow silent yoga cues on a small screen... 
""So how long do I hang in downward facing dog? What is Adriene doing now?""
Hit Pause. Rewind. Try again.
After several attempted rewinds and trying to do Exactly what Adriene was doing, I decided that letting go of my codependency and ""flying"" on my own might be what I needed to do. I decided it must be as important to trust myself as much as I trust Adriene's lead in yoga. 

The cool thing was.. what I really appreciated... was that I still heard most of the cues in my head. ""Relax your shoulders and face. Press into the four corners of your feet. Rise from your core."" Etc etc

But Having this journey and showing up on my mat daily, the consistency, the community, its kept me going! I've been following YWA for about 5 years now, I even bought a tee Shirt this time as I just wanted to give back! Thank you Adriene for being a beacon of hope, for giving your time and passion so selflessly, for helping so many of us around the world who need these practises now more than ever! 7 months ago I broke both bones in my left arm and following surgery to have metal plates in, I didnt think I would be able to chaturanga ever again! but here I am 7 months later finally healed and following the practise and even managed to try crow pose again!

This is not my first time doing one of the 30 days of yoga series but it is the first time I did it consecutively which makes me really proud. On the 3-4 series I've done so far, I always felt really lost on day 30, sometimes I would start and then give it up because I didn't really know what to do or I would feel discouraged, others I'd just skip it.
This time, I wanted to stick with it, so I did. And boy, was I marvelled that I did almost the 50 min without doubting, trusting myself and with a smile on my face!! (And barely looked at the video!) I hope this gives hopes to anyone feeling uneasy about the day 30 practice ""alone"", you can do it!

And thank you, Adriene, for the tools you gave us through this journey! 😊

I must admit i was a bit scared of the fact that there is no voiceover guidance, but it was very easy to follow and super rewarding! a great conclusion to these last 30 days!

The 50min (which at first felt intimidating) went by so fast and I reached a wonderful state of inner peace and accomplishment.

2764.0,"I've been trying to complete the 30 days of yoga with you since the beginning of the series. I never did; there was always something - I was too hungry, too full, too tired, to energized, had too much time, not enough time. Searching for the 'perfect' moment to do yoga took me more energy than, now I realize, actually doing yoga. This year, I changed my perspective. I did yoga full, hungry, extremely tired, one day I even did it a bit tipsy. I asked myself - What is the worst thing that can happen, if I do yoga in X condition? I knew halfway through our journey, that I will finally do it this year, because my mindset was completely different. But I guess this is something that all the other 30 days and my yoga journey up till now taught me, I just needed more time than I expected :) Thank you!",UgzABLhmw7Dw8cmQ-Z54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-01T07:29:44Z,-0.9989153146743774

2830.0,"I don't usually have trouble with Day 30, but it was difficult this year. This past year has been so lonely, and I think the connection of hearing a voice guide me along - even though I know I'm capable of guiding my own practice - has become such a comfort for me throughout the months of lockdown and working from home and missing just being around people. Practicing without that today left me feeling uneasy and disconnected. That said, the other 29 days of this have been so exactly what I needed right now and really resonated with me and I'm so so so grateful to Adriene for sharing these beautiful practices.",Ugwy7wElO_c6CIVE1T94AaABAg,6.0,119.0,2021-02-01T05:46:01Z,0.9985583424568176

2870.0,"Definitely a bittersweet practice today. I'm sad that it's come to a close but I'm so proud of how far we've come. I've been practicing yoga for a couple years now (pretty inconsistently) but this year was the first time that I was able to practice everyday and complete all 30 days. I was admittedly scared of day 30 because I knew there would be no cues or guide but I trusted myself and felt like I didn't even have to think about my next move.

This practice has opened my heart and has truly helped me stay grounded off the mat when things might seem out of control. Yoga has become an important part of my daily routine and I'm so glad that I said yes on day 1. I successfully held back my tears during the practice but definitely cried like a baby when I heard the outro in shavasana and all could think was 'I did it! I did all 30 days!'

With all that said, thank you for taking me on this incredible journey.",UgyRgGBq6Dik_ptbcNp4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2021-02-01T04:55:23Z,0.9994773268699646

Thank you so much for these last 30 days, Adriene. In the beginning I frequently stopped to cry because it was so hard for me at the time, mentally and physically. This being after so long at home alone every day with my desk job, not getting any movement because of the pandemic. It hurt and I felt weak and embarrassed. Your emphasis on showing up being the hardest part rang in my head any time I felt like not putting in the time or effort- so I did exactly that, and showed up. Every day. I could spend forever talking about how this has changed me, but I'll sum it up by saying I feel a lot more human and I'm finally strong enough to call downward dog a resting pose haha.
Getting back into yoga was one of my three New Years resolutions- Breath really was the perfect thing, and at the perfect time for me. I will be showing up again every day, starting tomorrow. I can't wait!",UgwKnUJbJc28siBLLGV4AaABAg,1.0,5.0,2021-02-01T04:53:43Z,0.9980680346488953

I did not feel comfortable without guidance and didn't make it through the entire video today, but I am still proud of making it through all 30 days and giving today an honest attempt.  Now I have something to aspire to in my practice.  Normally I would beat myself up over ""failing"" today but that is an old version of me.  My new story is of a man who shows up, makes an attempt, and accepts when growth is still needed.  A man who is present and is connected to his breath.

2884.0,"In a way, this was the most beautiful practice this month. I'm so incredibly proud of myself for making it this far. I've never completed a 30 day journey...I usually don't make it a week. 

I'm proud of everyone else who stuck this far! It's sad to see the views dropping so dramatically in the beginning after the first few days, and each video gained less and less... so for those of you that made it here... congrats!

There were times I kept up with Adriene, and there were times I closed my eyes and did my own thing. 

There were even times that I glanced up and saw that Adriene was doing something I just did, like knocking on heaven's door. It felt so natural. 

There was an emotional realization about halfway though of ""I did it... I did it!"" And I felt complete and total freedom. This journey was beautiful, and has changed me for the better. I plan to continue my daily yoga practice, and I look forward to looking back in the future and realizing how far I've come!",UgzTP5Kpu9Y6z40Ilbh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-01T04:40:23Z,0.9993413090705872

2904.0,"dear adriene, I have always loved yoga but gave it up as a practice almost twenty years ago because of persistent and sudden bouts of vertigo - i basically plan my activities around not inverting my head and triggering an attack. Found you in december rather randomly when i was looking for some lower back exercises, and then decided to embrace the 30-day yoga practice. It has been amazing every step of the way - you reminded me of why i used to like yoga, but i also don't think i have ever encountered an instructor who taught with as much clarity and empathy as you do. 
3 days ago - day 27! - I had a sudden attack of vertigo during a side twist - and I thought I would have to just give up as I have in the past. But your encouragement to always practice modifications and work with what you have gave me courage to complete the last 3 days, and also not to live in fear of bringing on a vertigo attack. It happens, i still can survive. I can't go on, I go on. 
I look forward to many many more days of yoga to come, and also practicing *with* vertigo as that is part of me, too. Thank you for everything.",UgxAiEMsKakCahmFW_R4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-01T04:21:33Z,0.9971181154251099

Always an emotional moment at the end when you bow to us. We bow to you equally. I thought this one was never gonna end, the longest 30 days it seemed. Will you make the next one next year a tad bit more balanced with breathing & exercises combined in each session, please. This felt like sometimes we had only breath and sometimes only packed with asanas, one after the other. I like it more when each session is more equally spread. Also, may we have DAY1 released a day sooner please, beause Australia/Europe are ahead of your time zone. You are an angel. BTW. your SI Joint VIDEO has helped me a lot 1,5 year ago.

I have tried to commit to a 30 day yoga challenge so many times in the last few years always starting from the point of hating how I looked and sometimes so determined to change that I would attempt 30 days of yoga on top of daily exercise routines and additional cardio. Usually made it about a week. My body was something to be critiqued not something I even felt connected to. This year after a crazy year I decided to try starting with loving myself for who I am right now and seeing what I could accomplish. This was the first times I’ve been sitting here after a Day 30, successful. Showing up everyday, actually focusing on my breath not waiting for more planks.

I sat on my mat and cried for a minute, feeling the absolute enormity of not having her voice in my ear guiding me and making me smile and reassuring me. It felt deeply vulnerable, asking me to trust myself for an hour and guide my own practice. So I cried. And then I sat and grounded in my breath. And then somehow I DID know what I needed. I moved through my practice with so much love for myself and for this space. I felt strong and graceful and more connected to my body and my movement and my breath than I have in a long time.

Last year I really started doing yoga, but I didn't really do it regularly till late November.

This month is the first I've done every single day without missing a day :) Nothing wrong with missing a day, but any time I thought about skipping I kind of just said, screw it, and came to the mat. Though I didn't last the full 50 minutes today, I did do my own 30 minute routine and it felt amazing. I'm planning on starting Home tomorrow, just because I want another 30 day journey to go on.

My mind needs to return to my breath. I feel more connected to it now than ever. That was the most zen practice I have had in a while. I teared up a little when the theme music played at the end. It's been a wild ride everyone, and I am so glad that I was able to practice with all of you. Knowing we are not alone in our practices makes them just a little bit more interesting.

This was my very first 30 Day Journey and I was very surprised when I learned that we won't be guided for this last session. Though I was anxious at first, I just decided to sit on the mat, breathe (get it??) and do what my body wants, then I ended up with a flow that I enjoyed (which I didn't know was possible just by doing this for thirty days).

To those who didn't like craning their heads to look at the video every so often, maybe try coming up with a flow just by listening to your body? That's what I did for this session and maybe that might work for you, too.

Day 30 is aways a little intimidating for me at first, but I've found that once I get started, things start to flow, and it's really fun to decide what direction to go in! 

I also flashed right back to this time last year when the Home music played, and I remembered working my way through Dedicate this past spring and True in the summer when I heard those themes. Yoga has helped so much with the isolation over the course of the last year, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels that way.

People were literally asking me things mid practice and Jesus that was hard to deal with since it doesn’t normally happen (I don’t have kids or sweet fur babies so normally it’s a bit of peace).

This is my first 30 day challenge of yours that I've completed and I didn't know about the 30th day tradition: let me just say, though there were of course times that I paused and got a little lost, I can't believe how freeing this experience was. A couple times I looked at my screen to see we were in the same poses! It was a magical feeling to use my breath as inspiration - it really made the time fly and kept me curious during this very long session. It really gives me hope for the days to come, hoping to incorporate daily yoga from now on.

3153.0,"dear Adriene,
I can't believe I've made it. I've learned more this month than I did for years in my life. I've gained knowledge about discipline, focus, love, breath. I've realized that's okay to feel vulnerable. that not everyday is gonna be a good one, but that's not the end of the world. that breath is always there for me. although there's still a lot to learn, today i feel more mature about my relationship with my mind and my body. and that's thanks to yoga, and to you as the amazing instructor and human you are. this feels like a sweet ending, but it's also the beginning of a new journey, and I'm letting you know that I'm taking you with me! I will be forever grateful.

3155.0,"And here I find myself at the end of an incredible journey... showing up for myself every day for 30 days without fail. While the physical changes i've experience have been great, it's the mental aspects that have really changed my perspective. I've been practicing with you since 2016 (albeit inconsistently) yet this month I noticed an incredible gain of flexibility and strength of MIND. Even without your guiding voice today, as I flowed alongside you, my own voice came to me. Only kind words, words of affirmation, ""I'm doing great, keep going!"" ""I am strong"" ""I am love"". Adriene I cannot begin to thank you for the amount of worth and love you've instilled in me, or perhaps it was your guidance that awoke it and brought it out of me. For the entirety of today's practice I had a huge smile on my face, amazed by how incredible and beautiful my body is for being capable of doing this. You always thank us for sharing our time and practice with you, but today I was to say the biggest thank YOU for sharing YOUR time and practice with us. Thank you for always being here for me over the past 5 years. Whenever I need a place to relax or clear my head, I always find my way back here.

Day 30 is often a struggle for me because I miss hearing Adriene guide us through the practice—not just the instruction but also her humor, thoughtfulness, and soul-searching ideas/prompts. But one thing I love about Day 30? Listening to the theme music from all the previous 30 Day Journeys. It's a nostalgic wave of good feels every time. 🥰

I have strength, flexibility, balance, and the ability to manage my stress in ways that I never knew I was capable of before you gave me these tools.

3256.0,"I used to have a recurring voice injury, and I was stunned when the doctor told me I was “breathing wrong.” How could I be messing up something that’s instinctual? Apparently, I held my breath too often, or used up all my air before another inhalation (think: stuck in the Kumbhaka).

I eventually became a speech-language pathologist, but not before I’d accumulated years’ worth of compensatory habits (lifted shoulders, strained neck) and psychological trauma from being unable to control my voice and breath (croaking in unexpected moments, fear of singing). All of which I’m still unlearning even after 8 years after my last injury.

Yoga with Adriene was the only thing that got me practicing regularly, after dabbling in yoga for years (even hated it back in college!) Last March was when I did my 1st 30-Day, Home, and have been on the mat consistently since. In the span of one year, I’ve been healing my mind and nourishing my body with every inhale, and not forgetting to exhale!

On the last day of Home, I froze and cried when Adriene said she’d go off mic; I felt sad that it was ending and panicked that I wasn’t ready to flow on my own. But I found my own pace, and my body found its own voice.

At the start of today’s session, I found myself crying again, but this time from so much joy, and acknowledging how far I’ve come, and thinking about so many people around the world with their own sets of struggles, but all journeying with me. How much more fitting when some of the music from past 30-day challenges accompanied my movement, like a soundtrack to my growth? No sadness now that “it’s ending,” because so long as I have breath, I’ve stopped deciding where it ends.

3271.0,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I think this turned out to be my favorite day of this series.  Breath was difficult for me to land in despite (or, perhaps, because of) the fact that I spent 2020 grounding in yoga and using it as a tool to center myself.  I found myself mildly dreading this day, even though it has always been my favorite, especially once I found out how long it was.  But I arrived, I took a breath, and I allowed myself to land, finally, wholly.  I finally looked at some real fears I have been aware of but ignoring the last month.  I finally surrendered to my intuition.  This day healed me as it always does - always when I need it.  I am so excited to move into February after this beautiful journey.  I know I gained and grew so much in these last 30 days and will be discovering just how much for a while, I'm sure.  I think I'm going to spend the next seven days in a chakra series and then the rest of the month listening to what I need each day and finding a video (or meditation music) to fit it.

Yoga has truly taken all the scattered parts of me and made me whole, connected.  Adriene, I have been returning to your videos for several years now, but recently made a commitment to yoga every day June 1, 2020.  Thank you for your support and this community.

I know I have the tools to practice on my own but I kept looking at the screen- I was more than a step behind every pose. I couldn't get myself to relax into this practice even with trying to focus on my breath and trying to go free style. I obviously have more work to do as I'm not ready for a solo flight. Thank you though for the wonderful journey.,UgzM0lEbTNJdbIQ0VOt4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-02-01T00:07:02Z,0.8843553066253662

Are you going to start another 30 days with Adriene or maybe concentrate on individual postures? Feeling like I was part of everyone doing this together got me through some of the tougher practises but now I'm not sure what to do tomorrow.

And in reflection to the current situation I hope that the souls who pass on everyday due to C-19 thier last breath is a peaceful and calm one. We continue to breath for you. Happy day 30 YWA yogis.

3322.0,"Wow, that was the most beautiful experience. I did Home last month, and day 30 was such a breakthrough for me, I cried the entire time. But I copied your movements, I followed the video pretty much the whole time. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I got so much from that experience last month, and that was exactly what was right for me in that moment. But today, the music moved within me, today I followed my own heart's song. It's like the yoga movements that were right for me just appeared in front of me. It was as if I was performing a dance. Every once in a while I would get a pang of anxiety or a thought would pop up like, ""Wait, how long have I been doing this?"", ""Should I catch up to Adriene?"", ""What if I forget what I did on this side when I get to the other leg?"", but I just moved through them. I continued to follow my heart. A few times I would notice you were at a similar place or pace as me and I'd decide to join you for a nice knocking on heaven's door, and then I slipped back into my own flow. And I expected to be sobbing through this one like I did the last. I cried in the beginning when you were speaking about new beginnings, but once I got started, all I could do was smile and laugh. I was flying. As someone who struggles with PTSD, who has been long trudging through grief, I never expected this. And I couldn't be more filled with hope. I couldn't be more grateful to you, Adriene. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Daily yoga is undoubtedly something I'm going to continue for the rest of my life. I can't believe I went so long without it. Namaste and Abundant Love to All. 💓🦋✨",UgyzpqYoz8cS6UvkzUN4AaABAg,0.0,11.0,2021-01-31T23:51:56Z,0.9942238926887512

I feel like I've gained so much in this 30 days and I don't think I went a day without wondering how something that was so good for me could feel so good in the process. This journey really helped ground me every day and gave me a chance to self-reflect and sit with my emotions which is so very important for me. The practice today was awkward at times, and I missed your voice, and I spent moments wondering if I should be idling in a pose so long, (until i remembered the flow of my breath) but it was beautiful all the same.  I only did 35 minutes of the practice today and I wasn't upset with myself about it, I just did what felt right which is such a euphoric feeling!

3332.0,"Thank you so much Adrienne, you are an angel. I am in tears and I cried the whole practice today. When you said you were gonna take your mic off today I felt such a pang of panic in my heart as I knew this was the end and you were letting us go, on our own. It felt scary, and sacred. It felt generous, and empowering, and I started panicking in my head because I thought ""how am I gonna do this without her""? This is how I have come to rely on your voice, your guidance, your kindness, your empathy, your presence in the past 30 days. You have brought true light and love into my life and you have showed me how it's already inside of me, and today was the day where you revealed to me that big secret, that I had it inside all along, and I could do this without you. Today, I could see my own strength so clearly, maybe for the first time. I know these are big words and they might sound crazy, but I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm practicing yoga since a few years, and I have never really experienced an opening of the heart like I did today. I'm feeling very emotional right now. With everything happening in the world, in my life, in others life, all the misery, the sadness there is right now, the desperation, the fear...

(Yes, there were a few breaks just to sit in child's pose and have a big old cry!) 

Thank you, Adriene, and the community, for giving me the tools to achieve something I never thought I could commit myself to.

My body isn't as strong as it used to be and poses that used to be simple were so challenging. I had difficulty finding stillness and there were so many days where I almost gave up. But I was determined to stick with it to the end (I haven't made it through one of these challenges since 2017). I had to make modifications and take breaks during some of the videos, but I made it. Every day, I got one step closer. I'm proud of myself. I didn't meet what I thought my ""expectations"" should be, but I showed up and I did the work. My body might not be as strong as it once was- but it got me through the last 30 days. And I'm proud of it.

Looking at the screen to understand the sequence took me out of the moment through the sequence. The music just didn't match my practice and often distracted me from my breath.

I glanced over from time to time and either saw that you were doing something I had done earlier, or something I hadn’t done yet and hadn’t yet thought to do, so it definitely helped me get all the way through this long practice, but I was so heartened to see that I could do it on my own, without specific instruction the whole time. This was a great 30 days, and I plan on continuing after, taking some time, even if just a few minutes, each morning to feel my breath and my body.

It was an honor to be here and  keep showing up on the mat each day with y'all. I kept listening to my breath off the mat as well and doing the breath techniques you taught us in stressful situations, and it really helped.

That is such a treasure that I take away from this month. Stronger yes, but more able to connect to the breath, that I truly believe was breathed into us by our loving God.

3436.0,Thank you so much for this journey Adriene! Throughout the process and doing videos with you for the last three years I have at least once a practice found myself saying “Adriene coming in clutch!” aloud as you guided us through a movement that seemed so perfectly suited to what my body or spirit needed on that day. Exploring this every day this month with you helped me realize that - while I am sure you are a little psychic ;) - it wasn’t always that you magically knew what I needed but that my body and spirit was doing the work to find something that was already in the practice and suit it to myself! I have been trying to give myself more credit through this process and to take the leap of faith and practice with no guidance today was a perfect way to round off this journey!

3437.0,"Voiceover practices are my favorites normally, and I always look forward to these freestyle practices. But as soon as I started this practice, I felt a little nervous and sad that I wouldn't be hearing your cues, Adriene. Not because I felt that I couldn't follow on my own or move in my own way, but because I was afraid of getting ""out of step"" with you. This has been such a time of disconnect for everyone, and this series (and this channel, and your work in general) has created a place of unity and safety. As weird as it sounds, I felt like not hearing your voice would make me lose track of my pace, and that we wouldn't be practicing ""together."" But as you said, we have the tools to cultivate our own practice and to move in our own breath, and the intuition to feel what's coming next in the flow. It didn't take me long to appreciate the silence, the beautiful music, and the opportunity to be led by you (and my breath) in a nonverbal way.
Many, many thanks to you and the rest of the YWA team for creating something that has helped millions of people across the globe. This channel has been such a positive place for me and something that has helped me appreciate my life and my body when times are good and when times are bad. I wish I could give back in kind what has been given to me (and so many others), because it's been nothing but kindness and goodness.

3469.0,"This is only my second year of completing this 30 Day Yoga Journey but the first where I have managed to show up for myself every single day. Some days I was able to reach the mat with bundles of energy and enthusiasm whilst on other days I nearly didn't make it. But I did. We all did. In different ways and constricted by different schedules and time-scales but we did it.
It's nice to be able to compare how I felt this year vs the last. Last year I missed many days and, honestly, ended up completing the last section of ""Home"" as if it were an afterthought (not to say it wasn't still an amazing experience).
The main difference I've noted with this practice is that my awareness of emotion has improved dramatically and I am (slowly!) learning to trust my intuition, which, as a constant self-doubter and walking ball of anxiety, is huge for me! This practice felt sooo different from the others, I can remember last year struggling to work without Adriene's cues and becoming frustrated with myself if I fell behind. But this session was entirely different. Quite a few times when I took a glance at my screen I was shocked to find Adriene in the same position I thought I had (randomly) moved in to! I've never felt a connection like that before. When I felt uncertainty and panic rise up if the screen was vastly ahead of me, I was able to slow myself down and just breathe.
I don't think yoga is quite an everyday thing for me (yet) but I want to commit to showing up for myself more. My favourite mantra from this is 100%, ""everything is as it should be."" I never thought such a simple phrase could be so comforting. 
Thanks for sharing the tears, laughter and sing-a-longs!

I first started doing yoga here in the beginning of quarentine, i did your first 30 days journey and it completely changed everything in myself, i needed that so much in that time... And recently I've been through a tough experience where i got completely broken and your BREATH journey helped me to pick all the pieces together in myself by simply breathing in and breathing out (even though it could be so hard sometimes), it helped me in my healing process, it made the healing real. It's just too much feelings to put into words and i think it can look confusing...

I had so much resistance and felt the need to ""follow,"" and ""get it right."" After moving through 30 days of breath, I finally realized what it feels like to follow your own breath. To listen to your own inner voice. To march to the beat of your own drum. Thank you, Adriene. I get it now. 

I also began the practice thinking, ""Jeeze, 50 minutes? That's a long time to keep going on my own."" I got to the end and couldn't believe it when I heard the theme music going out. I WANTED TO KEEP GOING! 

I finished on my own - in absolute silence, except for, of course, my own breath. (Sorry this is a novel, but I'm flooded with feelings and thoughts and who better to share them with than this awesome, supportive community!) I watched the flurries falling outside and heard my dog sigh. I felt my heart beat. I smelled the candles I had lit. I felt the sweat on the back of my neck. I knew I was exactly where I should be.

Actually this year i did breath without skipping any day and on time unlike home and the lovely community on this channel and facebook group motivated me and hopefully someone mentioned on the group that day 30 is your own day that you create your own flow and i was looking forward to it because i love to practice on music and i am here to say that i loved this practice very much and i managed to it successfully and i am very happy about it and i was happy that i was proceeding adrienne with the poses then i saw here do the pose after me and actually i was hearing adrienne sound in the pose like she used to say in child pose breathe 5 times here.

For the first half I found I was unintentionally syncing up with Adriene - I went in saying, I'll do what feels right for me and not try to follow her without her voice to guide, but it like she was one step ahead of me every time I looked up. Half-way through though I felt my legs and hips and lower back wanted more love - so I parted ways with Adriene and used the 'vocabulary' she's taught me! Every now and then I'd look up and see something Adriene was doing and think ooh, yes yummy I might do that in a moment. I'm just so proud of being able to come to the mat in that new, mindful mindset able to guide myself. Thank you Adriene x",Ugzusk-w_C_m0E0EmQ54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-31T21:30:44Z,0.9948793649673462

I’m so proud of myself for being able to complete every move, like the balancing pose and crow pose (even if it was for a micro second, ha) Slowly lowering from plank has gone from torture to like hovering my body weight and with control lowering myself down, -now a pleasure) Throughout the entire practice I kept getting snippets of Adriene’s teachings coming to me, and words of advice. ‘Come on, you got this.’ ‘Whisper to yourself, I am strong.’ ‘Gather strength from your core.’ ‘Lower down with control.’ ‘Tap into that inner smile’ haha I could go on and on. I even smiled at the same time as Adriene when we did the smacking the but move 😁 Adriene, from my heart to yours, thank you 🙏🏼 You are the best yoga teacher and teacher in general, I’ve ever had xxxx ❤️",Ugy0jbEWkpKWcynv9Yl4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-31T21:29:21Z,0.9995189905166626

Today, I decided to just go for it and not feel the need to follow where you went today.  I was pleasantly surprised to synch up with you on certain poses even though we got there completely different ways. Ahhh, the beauty of Life!

3691.0,"I started practicing yoga about a year ago and couldn’t have done it without this series. I’ve gone back and done 2 of the other 30 day journeys, and I truly appreciate these. But ... and please don’t hate me ... the 30th silent day doesn’t work for me. I’m not relaxed. I’m constantly checking the screen to see if I need to transition, did I miss something, torquing my head in weird ways to see that screen. I often do much of a practice with my eyes closed, so this is 180 degrees from what I normally do. I’m a true fan, but following the FWFG tenets, day 30 isn’t for me.

To be completely honest, in the previous years I haven't been able to complete 30 days. I don't know why. Now I think I just wasn't ready. But this year I woke up at 6:30 am (Poland) with joy and anticipation to start my day with You, yoga and Benji 😊 And today for the first time I complete the 30 days so for me, it's some milestone, and I am proud of myself. I have my limitations. For the whole of my life I had problems with Achilles. My muscles aren't strong enough (yet) to do everything. But I tried and do my best. And now with Your help and guidance, I will try to complete 335 days of yoga. And I know I can do it because I am strong. See You tomorrow!

3704.0,"I did one of the other 30 day programmes last year but spaced it out. When it came to day 30 I was disappointed and only did a few moves before giving up. This time, I have done each session every day (minus one ill day) and again I wasn't looking forward to day 30 as I knew what was coming. I showed up, determined to try. I did 25mins of practice! The last 30 days this has given me something to focus on, some routine to each evening and got me moving. It's given me time for me, to relax, to forget, to unwind, to breathe! I haven't enjoyed every session, but I stopped clock watching after day three and have always come away feeling calmer and more 'at peace'. When a lot of things feel odd, weird, unsettling and unknown right now, this has been perfectly timed. Thank you Adriene ❤️",Ugy95m-VTAEabhZKwjJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-31T21:16:45Z,0.9962571859359741

3709.0,"I made it through the whole journey minus two days (one due to illness and the other due to the inauguration). I overall loved this Breath practice and felt it was so holistic and helped me strengthen inside and out. I must be honest; however, that I realized through this last session, that I like instruction. I found myself not breathing well and struggling with either following Andrienne (and straining my neck)...or getting flustered with what to do next.  I may be the only one who felt this way, but I was hoping for more feelings of unity and closure which was hard to accomplish when I felt I was kinda ""on my own"".  I would suggest maybe having a silent option, along with a guided one when completing a journey.  Or maybe, it was just too long for me. I probably could have felt more confident if I was guiding myself through 20 or so minutes.  But again...this does not undermine that great experience I had overall. I printed my bridge calendar and intend to continue. I appreciate Adrienne so much.  I'm just not confident enough to flow through 55 minutes with no instruction (yet).

Some days are great, other days I fall. And it’s ok. I love you Ms. Adriene and I will always do yoga with you.  I’ve also become quite the yoga advocate as well.

How precious it is, then, to witness what is possible, and find a potential to grow towards. 

Thank you for a fundamentally wellness- and health-boosting journey, Adriene - and grandmaster of ceremony, Benji! I breathe deeper, I sleep better, I am getting stronger.

3819.0,"I didn't expect to get so emotional today... It is very hard to put into words how much these beautiful daily practices have meant to me, but I'll try. 
I've always thought of yoga as something very slow, and full of difficult poses. I was astonished with how wrong I was when I started this 30 day journey. What really anchored me to the practice was Adriene's beautiful, graceful, and mindful presence and soul, and how kindly, and friendly she spoke. I wasn't sure before I started if I would finish the 30 days, but after I finished day 1, I was sure. I was prepared. I was committed. I was determined. And so, I did every daily practice, and every practice familiarized me even more with yoga, the breath, mindfulness, body-mind-soul connection, and staying mindful and present not only while I was on the mat, but outside of it too. Suddenly, the mat was my safe haven. I felt safe and protected while on my mat, like nothing could touch me, nothing could hurt me. I practiced and practiced every day, and after a few days, it occured to me that yoga had become a habit, and an escape from this crazy reality. I couldn't even imagine that I wouldn't show up on the mat every day. And it became non-negotiable. I felt at-peace, powerful, and fragile, calm, and content, and immensely proud for sticking with my practice. 
When the practice began, I had tears in my eyes, and when it ended as well. I hadn't realized how connected I felt to Adriene, Benji, and to this beautiful community practicing everyday. So, I very much look forward to seeing you all on the mat tomorrow, and I want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart to you, Adriene, and to Benji ❤️❤️❤️ THANK YOU SO, SO MUCH ❤️❤️❤️ I will miss seeing a new video every day, but I'm really grateful for the February calendar, which I'll surely follow!!",UgzZA5a1DCVYxW9Bd914AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2021-01-31T20:36:15Z,0.9983534812927246

3868.0,"This was probably my favorite workout ever, with Adriene, who helped me  created it myself.  I've done every single series, which have helped build strength in a permanently injured knee (dance/cycling), and when I could finally do yoga squats (toes out), that was a miracle.  But at each of the other 30th (or 31st) days, perhaps I didn't have enough ""vocabulary"", as you say, and though I could create a workout, was not very satisfied with it.  This time, I worked faster, included a couple of binds not seen in the Adriene videos, and worked from top to bottom -- crown to ground.   It was great!  I was hungry and physically tired when I finished!  I think the faster pace made a difference, for me.  I cannot do planks because of 2 different car accidents that did a number on my shoulders, so substitute cat/cow or anything I can think of to build tricep strength.  Just wanted to say this was awesome for me, so kudos, and thanks!",UgyydDFoUm1IKlHYH794AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-02-01T14:52:52Z,-0.9487188458442688

The peace and contentment I now feel throughout my days is worth every drop of sweat and falling on my face almost daily. ☺️😂🥰",Ugwb-_XthM8z3lsep-Z4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-31T19:43:03Z,0.9996587038040161
3979.0,"I was so nervous that there wouldn't be any verbal cues. I think sometimes I trust Adriene more than I trust myself, so if she believed we could do it, I thought I would at least try. And by the end I realised I do utterly trust myself... I guess I just didn't know it. Sometimes I looked up and I was definitely not where Adriene was, and sometimes I was almost completely in sync. When I closed my eyes, I heard her voice telling me to breathe, to pause, to slow down- she was still guiding me. I loved this practice so much. I didn't think I'd be emotional but when Adriene bowed at the very end, I cried. I really needed to learn to trust myself, on the mat and off the mat. Thank you Adriene! Thank you Benji!

I was a total mess at day one, physically and mentally, since July I was stuck in an almost permanent anxiety status, but since the first day of the 30 days practice progressed I felt such a relive in my mind and body for the first time in my life! It is the first time I feel in charge of my own body, my own life and my own mind! The anxiety is not totally gone, but so much more manageable then before! I can’t thank you Adrienne enough for this beautiful gift you share with us all! You are really an angel! And it was so interesting for me that all the postures today I could do almost effortlessly, which I could not always do in the last 29 days. It is impressive what you can accomplish in just 30 days!

Also, it is amazing how this journey always shifts my mindset. One time during this wonderful last session I came out of a twist and saw Adriene flying in crow pose and instead of talking negatively about myself in my head because I can't do crow at the moment, I instantly felt so proud and happy for Adriene that she can do it so nicely.

But I'm so proud of myself for pulling through.

Fun fact: I only started this program because I have issues with my skin and sweating actually hurts a lot, so I was looking for a way of moving my body, building strength and flexibility without sweating and I have to say, I was not disappointed! I actually looked forward to the practice everyday and will definitely continue with BRIDGE.

I've been practicing alongside of you for quite a while now and usually I'm not commenting much. But now I feel like it's the time to thank you so much for this journey. 
I love the way in which you created these 30days, the practice felt so natural and there was so much integrity in the way you put together the pranayama, the asanas and the constant reminders to fwfg. 
I spend most of the time alone in quarantine for I had caught corona and this journey definitely helped me to accept my emotional roller coaster and even enjoy it. 
Also I never felt able to put together such a long sequence by myself and always avoided it or gave up after 10 or 15min. This time it was suddenly so easy to practice next to you. Thank you for teaching me to follow and trust in my intuition! 

Thank you so much!

I feel so much more accomplished - I was floored I did the whole 50 minutes. I feel strong, focused, and clear. Thank you Adriene & sleepy Benji.

4217.0,"Adriene thank you so so so much for this practice! When I have done your other 30 days of yoga, I must admit I often skip a day and I always skip the last day because I don’t think I could guide myself through a practice. But this month was my first time signing up and getting the emails which kept me so motivated and I didn’t miss one day! There weren’t even days where I didn’t feel like doing it. I have been working from my kitchen/sitting room this past year so it’s hard to switch off but doing these videos after work has helped so much. I am amazed at myself and that I could do this practice today.

That practice ended in a completely different mindset, one where I felt proud, confident, and calm. This year, knowing it was coming, I was actually excited to listen to my body for this last day. This was the first time I've done a 30-day journey live, and I got emotional during this last practice knowing that I and so many others stuck with this for so long.

4240.0,"I almost skipped today, thought about putting on a different practice, because I didn’t want to do it without Adriene’s guidance. But then, I realized, this is what it’s all about—deciding to take a risk, to breathe deeply, to listen trustingly to the voice within. I did what Adriene said: start with the breath, and then just do what feels good, what the body craves. I went very slowly, listening to the beautiful music, breathing the scent of my candle, learning step by step to trust myself, and whenever I got stuck I watched a bit of the video and there was my good friend Adriene reminding me of all she’s taught me. I took the video back at the end so we could bow together. I finished with a sense of confidence and hope I had been seeking from others, but now know it resides within, just like Adriene says.

From time to time I tried to find my own flow, but I think because I lack self confidence and I always double check what I do, I had to peak at Adriene most of the time - therefore the cheating feeling came in strong.

But I made it. 
It's been exactly 1 year since last time I did 30 days yoga journey and this time I want to continue day after day until I can say ""It's been 2  months of uninterrupted yoga"", then 3, 4 and finally 1 year.

Got through it and it was beautiful but, I have to ask .. did anyone else lose their balance or place while trying to peek!? What I learned today is I mostly listen.. i have truly developed that skill..I look up infrequently and then just to make sure I heard right. This would be why I struggled w in person yoga classes.  No cues just flow.  

With all that said I found today an emotional journey; sadness that it’s ending; gladness that I did get through it; joy in almost doing dancers pose; but most of all gratefulness for the gift of Breath. If I have learned anything this year is not to take it for granted.  

I will miss this daily “surprise” of new practices. But, will take a deep breath and figure out where my yoga journey goes next.

4393.0,"Wow! Day 30!
I love the fact that this practice is called ""begin"". It's the cyclicality that governs the universe. Like the breath. After an exhale, comes an inhale. And after that inhale comes a new exhale and so on. 
It's beautiful that we get to choose our own practice today. It means that we've got the necessary tools to be in control and to guide our bodies to ""find what feels good"". The first times I was practicing yoga with Adriene I couldn't let go of the video on day 30, but after some time I found the confidence and courage to explore and listen to myself. This feels great!
So if you're having a hard time letting yourself go today, don't worry! Trust yourself, you've got it! You know what you need and more importantly: there's no right or wrong. Just let each movement unfold and enjoy the process.

I'm usually more emotional on Day 30 than I was today -- until Adriene wiped away tears during savasana. Then I cracked.

4396.0,"In the past I used to be no fan of the last practice of your yoga journeys because I felt lost, I didn't trust myself and I was afraid I'd miss something without you telling me what to do.
Now I've learned that I can trust myself and that it's okay if I miss a pose while staying longer in another pose.
It's about finding what feels good and listening to what our bodies and soul need.

4455.0,"Oh Adriene. I don't know where to start.
Came to practice today with a sense of hesitation. I never did Day 30 on your Yoga Journey before - because I thought what I loved most about Yoga was to be guided and ""switching off"" my brain for the practice, just being told what to do next. The idea of you not talking, but just practicing just didn't make sense to me - I mean, what was I supposed to do then?
Still, I pressed play - and oh how much JOY I have found in this hour. Most of the time I practiced along with you - but now and then, I really felt like doing something entirely different, and without much thinking, I did it. I have found so much joy in this practice because I felt you enjoyed your practice too, to me it seemed that not talking for a change kind of ""freed"" you to just play, move, breathe and practice as well, without concentrating on what to say next.
I really admired how this Day 30 practice was crafted as well - I feel like every single pose we did during the whole 30 day journey was in this, every one was like a friendly reminder like, hey, remember that day? Yeah, we did that pose too! You can do it!
I did every video of this series, the day it came out. First time for me of not only starting,  but actually also finishing a 30 day journey with you. I am deeply grateful, I feel inspired, and was deeply moved by these 30 days as well. Love to you Adriene, love to everyone practicing, filled with joy, gratefulness, love. All the feels. <3",Ugz4jlRtu4nMakzeEV14AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-31T17:32:16Z,0.9982523322105408

I spent most of the beginning of the practice in tears (happy ones) but moved from that to a feeling of euphoria as I worked through the practice with you. I surprised and delighted myself by remembering so much more than I'd realised but could also hear you, like little Angel Adriene, talking to me from within  - from tapping into my inner smile to smearing honey during the twist, from enjoying my little love cave during child's poise to  slapping my butt during Knocking On Heaven's Door! I channeled my breath using it in the way you've taught me, I thought about the juxtaposition of internal and external rotations....I could go on. It was an incredible hour made all the more special by seeing that I'd been practicing with almost 11,000 folk. That's a lot of people taking what they've learned on the mat into the world and that can only be a good thing. Namaste. Here's to the next adventure.

4518.0,"This was my third 30 Day Journey with Adriene so I knew what was coming and it scared me.  I love listening to Adriene's voice and I usually do most of the practices with my eyes closed. I like structure and so to have none freaks me out.  But this time, I told myself to just breathe and see where the Breath takes you.  I had some achy body parts, so I knew some areas that needed attention and there was a balancing pose I wanted to give one more try.  So I just started in a comfortable seat with the breath and it took me on the journey I needed for today.  I did experience that one amazing moment where I looked at my screen and I was in the exact same posture as Adriene and I smiled.  Thank you Adriene and Benji for being our amazing guides.

I’m sorry I loved this series but this missed the mark for me and caused so much frustration: if I wanted to listen to elevator music for 50 minutes and do random yoga moves I can do that on my own, I’m here for instruction and guidance. Sucks to be vision impaired for this one I guess, no audio clues at all and you’re on your own. I could not get into it at all and constantly interrupted every pose to see if we were still supposed be on x pose or if we had moved to y pose.

When I first read the title of this year’s journey , I was afraid that I would not make it through, because my relationship with my breath is one of the most complicated relationships in my life. As I’ve learned through this journey with all of you, it seems like I was not at all alone in this. Thank you , Adriene and Benji, for guiding us, and thank you to the whole community for making this so special. I am so proud of us!

Adriene, you truly touched my soul, and you truly changed my life - in general, but through this journey in particular. All my love goes out to you.

4586.0,"So, so beautiful.  Music has always impacted me and the opening music was no exception.  I literally cried through the first 11 minutes of practice.  I had just come to my meditation room after hearing a bit of news...vaccines, disagreement, one year since covid (etc, etc) and I think it all just hit me!  One year since the day that would change all of our lives dramatically.  But the breath is what connects us to this moment and allows us to surrender, allow, trust and open to it so that we can begin anew in each moment.  I do not know what the future holds for any of us but the vision I saw during savasana spoke the truth.  I saw the light of God/the Universe/the Creator streaming down upon all of us lighting our way with love.  Wishing light and love in each of your lives.

Your positive attitude and energy every day has been so rewarding, especially when I feel like I’m dragging myself into a practice. I did Home in August and learned so much, showed up every day, and vastly improved my vocabulary. However, on day 30, I saw that the practice was unguided, and didn’t trust myself enough to try it out. This time, guided by my breath, I decided to give it a try. And guess what? When the music ended, I had just put my hands together and was just about to say namaste. I was so shocked that the fifty minutes were over! YouTube autoplayed another video and I actually said “wait what? But I didn’t even get to say goodbye!!” out loud to my phone. Then I realized that that’s just what this practice is all about. It’s a new beginning. Don’t decide where it ends. I had so much fun exploring my practice today, and I just trusted myself to explore and be creative. The result? I held crow for longer than I have ever before! Adriene and this community’s inspiring comments I would read in preparation for or after most practices have been so fun to practice with, but I can guarantee that this is just the beginning! Thank you, everyone. Let’s all continue to show up. Let’s all continue to listen to our breath.The journey is only beginning.

Adriene: ""I'm getting emotional.""
*tears intensify* but seriously, thank you SO much Adriene. I've loosely followed your calendars for various months over the years but this is the first time I have followed all 30 and did this final practice with you and the community. It was so satisfying to sequence my own flow for each side and lean into where my body wanted to go. There was even a time when I looked up and we were both in cobra! This month I have felt like my mornings have been reclaimed (I did them before work) and have noticed my breath even more connected/conscious/intentional in my running as well.

4858.0,"Adriene - today I felt myself fully arrive into my whole being. For the first 25 years of my life, I lived my everyday life as a cisgender gay male. Recently, after my 25th birthday, I realized that these strict gender categorizations were limiting my happiness - being told by society that I am a gay man when I felt this wasn't quite right. Through my Wicca practice and yoga, I began to feel more aligned with the term ""non-binary."" This was a revelatory beginning for me, feeling my years of discomfort with my body, mind, and spirit start to spill out over the edges of societal confinements. Today during this practice, I embrace the beginning of my new journey as gender fluid, queer, and limitless. During this practice, I embraced my body and soul as it is - outside of myself and with the hundreds of thousands of other souls practicing with me. We are all limitless, we are all free, we are all HUMAN. From one Adrian to another Adriene, Namaste.",Ugz0AHBHS1-9js4Dwh54AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2021-01-31T15:50:24Z,0.9852147698402405

4948.0,"This is my first 30 day challenge and although I understand the emotional and physical impact of a DIY practice, I’m a bit frustrated. This month has no practices that are this long, so after 20 minutes of genuinely soothing and wonderful practice on my own I checked how much time was left and was shocked and frustrated to see 30 minutes left; I felt prepared to do 15/-25 minutes, as we had done a lot of those, but I felt unprepared to do such a long practice on my own, despite on and off years of (guided) yoga practice. 
Time cues or an optional audio track would be a big help for those of us who are either uninterested or unprepared for a practice like this. 
Pretty sad to end a great journey without a guided practice. Would have loved for this to be say 29, and then end on a big note together, guided, for day 30.

4998.0,"WOW. Adriene. THANK YOU for teaching me this month what the magic of yoga is. I've always struggled with yoga; to be in the now, in the moment. I would always get restless, wishing the minutes would go by quicker. I never thought I'd be able to do a 50 min yoga routine - if I saw that a video was longer than 20 mins I would never go for it, as I couldn't bare the thought of having to be ""still"" for that long. It just seemed impossible. I can't believe that I've now managed to do a 30 day challenge with you and all the other wonderful people across the globe! 
When you said in the beginning of the video that you wouldn't be guiding us in this one, I panicked. I've gotten so used to having you in my ears, guiding me through every step of the way. Holding my hand. How would I be able to do 50 mins without you holding my hand? 
I cried like a baby the first 10-15 mins of the practice. I don't know whether it was because I was scared and questioned if I could do this on my own, because of the absolutely beautiful music throughout the whole practice, or just because of the pure fact that you put your trust in me (us) that I (we) can do this on our own. Perhaps it was a combination of all of these factors. I just felt so touched. 
Somewhere along the middle of the practice my crying finally subsided. I even surprised myself by remembering the names of the poses that we did. And I remembered to breathe. I must admit, it was hard to follow along the practice without having you in my ears, as I like to close my eyes when I do yoga, but I am very happy with my efforts. Once I heard the outro music coming on at the end I started crying again. I am so proud of myself. I did it!
This month was so worth it and I look forward to continuing. What an incredible journey you took us on. 🥺 Thank you again, Adriene. 🙏❤️️ (and a special thanks to the cutest thing Benji 🐕  as well that has made me smile throughout this journey) Sending my love from Sweden!

5074.0,"My dearest Adriene, thank you so so much for sharing your practice with us. It has truly been life changing. I have found that everything I/we bring to the mat is always in the forefront of my mind now - whether that be conscious breath, self-love, grounding, honor, or whatever else, I am always reminded to be present with myself. I have cultivated so much more awareness of myself and my surroundings. By making this a daily routine and committing to it, I have brought strength and positivity into my life. I cannot express enough gratitude for you, this community, and this practice. I am ready to take on another 30 days!!!

5101.0,"It's really hard to put into words how I feel after this last practice😊 I don't know if it's because of the beautiful background music or knowing that it's the last day and I really did my best, but it never ever felt easier to do the poses, everything went so smoothly,  no shaky planks, no losing my balance, deeper twists, more flexibility. Downward facing dog was never my favourite but today that was so easy as well, my heels even touched the ground sometimes and I could even stay in crow pose for almost 2 seconds 😀 I feel amazing, I see real results and I am proud of myself. Of course my poses are not perfect but I trust that I am exactly where I should be. 
I will miss the live sessions but I will definitely continue with the monthly calendars. 🧘‍♀️

As a superstitious Aries, new beginnings are supposed to be my forte, yet I've had such a hard time 'getting the feel' of this...THE BREATH was the final piece! (It should have been the first!)

The next year I tried day 30 on my own, but it didn't feel very good. I looked at Adriene a lot and had to think really hard between poses, what to do next.
Then it got better every year! I learned to enjoy it and boy, did I love THIS day 30! 50 minutes, just me and my breath, eyes closed for a lot of the time and IT. FELT. SO. GOOD. I even broke a sweat, although nobody forced me too, just because I wanted to test my limits and see where my breath would take me.

I couldn’t relax into any posture because I had to keep my eyes on the screen the whole time. At first I thought the music was going to change slightly every time there was a change (which would have been a great idea)  but it stopped doing that after the first few changes.

""Begin to gently deepen your breath, marry the effort with ease, find what feels good.""  At some point, I stopped and just began watching the video (probably not what we were supposed to do, but . . . . ), I became overwhelmed with gratitude for your beautiful soul and how this practice has grown into a sacred time that I look forward to and can hardly go one day without.  About that time, Benji was at the window and you unfolded your blanket and patted it for Benji to come lay down which he did.  I was almost in tears.  And then I began listening. I could not only hear your prompts, but also my guide within.  From that point on, I didn't try to follow your lead, but did what came to me naturally and what I felt like my body and soul needed.  Then you were doing ""knocking over heaven's door"" and I was like, ""No, wait for me!""  LOL!

I could feel the shift during this last class...I just followed my intuition and often times I was right along with Adriene as she wordlessly guided us..probably because I could hear her words in my head. The sign of a great teacher. Other times I just did my own thing, and that was pretty empowering.I was a bit worried that 50 mins would be too long, because in Dec I would've found even 20 mins to be a long session..I'm not usually one to move slowly or just sit in stillness. But I noticed how I was just marinating and soaking up all the delicious moments, savouring my breath. When the intro music came on in the end, and we brought our hands to the third eye, I felt tears in my eyes. What a way to begin this year.

I had no trouble flowing through this 1 hour free style practice; if that isn't a testament of all the things I've learned this month...! I was aware of my breath for an hour and when I felt like shifting through to another pose I stayed for two more cycles of breath, for good measure. :) I challenged myself with difficult poses, but also really enjoyed all the time I wanted for my favorite ones. I even found myself rewinding the video, because I wasn't finished yet! And my mind barely wandered from the practice. The music really helped with that.

During this challenge I found out that I especially enjoy ujjayi breath. It lets me imagine ocean waves. This last practice really let me explore that. As I breathe in I imagine being the ocean itself and pulling the water back and it makes me feel grand and powerful.

I'm so happy I got to share this journey with all of you, people, it's such a great feeling. And this journey spoke to me so much. Last time for the last video I kept my eyes open to follow you all along Adriene, here I only checked once or twice the time left to make sure I would lie down early enough to get some meditation time but from beginning to end, I listened to myself, I followed my breath.
This felt so so good and I'm so grateful to have had the privilege to connect this way with everyone here and with myself.

Very surprised at how quickly that 45 minute self practice went by. Ive been practicing YWA for 3 ish years now and this was the first year I completed the 30 days in order, adding several other videos to each day to the practice 60-90 mins per day. There were tough days, but feel my practice has grown a lot in the last 30 days. The past three years of yoga have been life changing to say the least. Getting on the mat is the one time I can find unity between mind, body and soul. That exquisite stillness is truly sublime. One of the beautiful things about yoga is that there is always room to grow. Every ending is a new beginning! Words of wisdom from a true master. Thank you for your teachings and insight always. And of course, I’ll still see you tomorrow on the mat 😉 Wishing peace of mind and good vibes to all my fellow friends of Yoga With Adriene across the world!

Did i keep my eyes open the whole way through and copy everything Adriene did - sure. Did I have to take breaks and sometimes forget to breathe - also sure. But did I enjoy the practice and feel great afterwards - yes! And if there’s anything I’ve learned from Adriene the past year is to go at my own pace and find what feels good for me 😊 Thank you Adriene for an amazing series and all the work that goes into it. It’s always sad when they are finished but I look forward to continuing in Feb. Lots of Love from Dublin, Ireland 🇮🇪💚😊

Also the soundtrack for this video was amazing, hoping its on the Spotify playlist!? If not I will be playing this video whenever I need some beautiful relaxing background music!!

But for this new year I found, that I'd like to primarily do something for the soul and my mental health, so I found you. I'm so thankful for being able to do this journey with all of you wonderful souls, because I feel like it changed me so much, everything in life seems more manageable and I'm less stressed in general. I feel like there's so much more love and piece in my soul, for the people around me as well as for myself (which took a looong time). Also, although this time it wasn't my main goal, I feel like I got much stronger and fitter! I noticed, that a lot of practices, that were hard for me in the beginning, became easier over time, which just shows me again, how consistency and basically just showing up every day is key.

I really didn’t want this to end. This journey has had and always will have a special place in my heart.

During corpse pose at the end, I kept saying to myself out loud that I am giving myself kindness, care and compassion over and over. Some moments I would hesitate in the sentence but each time I completed it, I felt a weight chip away.

I was nervous to practice alone today, but it worked out so well and I cannot believe I just invented my own 50 minute yoga practice. I especially loved learning about the breath and new breathing techniques, which I will incorporate into my daily life, especially in anxious moments. I am getting really emotional because I was able to find a new source of joy in my life thanks to this 30 day journey. I cannot wait for new practices and new experiences.

5623.0,"I’m sure I’m not the only one here to say, this series has gotten me through the month. Without this series I don’t know how I would have coped with how horrible this January has been. For those people coming to this in the future, where the trauma we’ve been through has faded from recent memory, it was traumatic to live through such a time. Each day brought with it a barrel of negative news, which I will not go into here. But each day also brought a new video. And boy, did I use that time to reset myself. To centre and reconnect. To remember that there is good in the world. 

To all my fellow participants, seeing your comments each day also renewed my faith that the world IS a good place. Thank you to each and every one of you who took the time to say something. Your words touched more people than you’ll ever know. 

And finally, to Adriene, Benji, and all the people behind the scenes at YWA, thank you from the bottom of my heart. You saved me.

5682.0,"I want from the bottom of my heart to say thank you for this journey. I have learned so much and feel so thankful for getting to experience this. When I started I didn't know what to expect. My goal was to introduce a new routine to my everyday and to move my body. I recieved so much more. BREATH helped me deal with my grandmother passing away which I didn't know how to handle. After each practice the first two weeks I cried and felt like I could really let go of the sorrow I felt. It was a complete new feeling to me and instead of only feeling sorrow I felt grateful for the time I got to spend with her. 

I learned that I can do much more than I could ever imagine and feel so proud of my self for doing this for me. I also feel proud because I'm doing this out of self love, this time is purely for caring for my body and mind.

Thank you for creating this for us. For teaching and sharing your knowledge and wisdom. Thank you for taking the time and spending the energy to create BREATH.

And thank you to everyone who has been on this journey and to everyone commenting and writing about your thoughts and experiences. I really felt supported by all of you and honored to hear about your journeys.",UgzUvw_alc5DMkFBoPB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-31T10:32:02Z,0.9996722936630249

It mainly frustrated me because at that point I had been doing yoga for a year and I felt I should have been better.
Another year on and I fully trusted myself and my breath to take me through the practice.

5737.0,"Just finished the Beginning. I am sitting here crying my eyes out. My first time doing the 30-day-challenge- I freaked out when I heard that there were no instructions today because I just could not trust myself to ""think about the poses"" without a voice guiding me. The first twenty minutes I almost cramped trying to be in sync with Adriene. And then I started breathing and focussed on what I want, what I need. I am an absolute beginner in yoga and as with every exercise I start I thought I needed precise and ongoing instruction. Today for the first time in my life I found out that I just have to listen to my body and to my mind- they show me what they want. And my breath guides me through. I still am amazed how this went. I don´t think from now on I will just snap a finger and get in sync, but everytime I think I ""fail"" I can and will remember this half hour I was in sync with my body, my breath and myself.
Thank you, Adriene. Although I look forward to do more yoga WITH your voice guiding me, I now know I already have some tools to find peace and moments of calmness when I need them. The most important one: Breath. My breath is my anchor. My anchor is my breath.",UgyzE7A2XYyOhdlWbNp4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-31T10:07:04Z,0.9933120608329773

I have a very hard time not being guided when I dont know what im doing. It is very clear that I dont trust myself. Eventhough im all alone doing this, Im still afraid that I cant follow along, eventhough I have practiced yoga with you for almost 3 years now. So this time I thougt, just watched a bit of it, so you have an overview of what is going to happen, and that actually helped. Im so happy that I found my own way of dealing with this. I dont need to be uncomfortable, it is ok to know what works for me. And then maybe over time, I begin to trust myself in the unknow, and maybe not. For me it has been so so important to feel what works for me, and not make it a problem. And this journey of ""Find what works for you"" has helped me alot. Lots of love from Denmark.

Always positive. encouraging, non judgemental with a sense of fun. In the same way I keep my TV switched off these days. It's on the shelf. It no longer serves.

5848.0,"It may have been around September of 2015 when I first found your channel. I had wanted to learn yoga to help rehabilitate my body after a significant weight loss and to help kind of smooth everything out, because, at the time, I was working a largely sedentary job. I had no idea, then, that yoga would become such a huge part of my life. I practice daily, now, thanks to you. The time I spend on the mat helps bring a balance into my life, and helps mitigate the stress of working in Emergency Services. This was the first time you saved my life.

Towards the end of November last year, you saved my life again. I had taken a fall after a practice (well, during, but the fall kind of cut that short), and had gone to the bathroom to get cleaned up, where I fell again, and hit my head on a radiator. I remember darkness, I remember cold, and I remember a tiny spark of... something, which came to me as the sound of your voice, telling me to listen to the sound of my breath. It was then I realized I wasn't breathing. If it wasn't for the memory of your voice... well... I may not be typing this. 

So proud of you, for being consistent, for sticking with it all through so many years, proud of the growth you've made since squeaky old floor.

I loved this last practice too, but as I usually mainly listen to your voice, Adriene, I found it difficult to both do my own thing and let myself be inspired by your sequence.

I finally decided to go back home for good last Christmas, after 9 years working in different places and struggling to just see my family from time to time. During January I had to get used to be back in a small town, away from all the friends from the last years, close to my family, but without the chance to be with them as much as I wanted to. It's been quite an unstable period but Adriene, Benji and all this beautiful community has helped me to stop, BREATH, connect, focus and start again. Thank all of you for making everyday unique and full of gratitude. This will be indeed a new start for me, having yoga as my companion for good and bad days.

It was a commitment I didn't know I would make when I randomly stepped on the mat four weeks ago. But then I showed up, day after day. It felt less like a challenge but more like a welcome, like a common journey and today it felt like an arrival on the mat. 
I flowed with my eyes closed for the first 20 minutes, my arms wanted to dance so I let them dance through the poses and movements. I sought your guidance when I needed it and when we came together for the final Namasté, I had tears running from my eyes because there was a huge wave of gratitude rushing over me. I felt this deep in my heart.

Sky aflame 
Candy floss clouds float by
Red clay domes reach up 
with each inhale a lengthening 
Steady wooden crafted bows drift by dreams 
Reality bends as islands of hyacinth move inwards
Studied beating of white over the tide 
meets expectations of stillness 
Skimming the top of hope this new year promises
Different and familiar all in a single swirl 
A lone bright buoy 
afloat among the ripples",UgwLeJO_MiL37iInxc54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-31T07:46:44Z,0.9947314262390137

This was my first „freestyle“ practice and I felt a bit lost at some points, but always had Adriene to look to whenever I got stuck. No rush, just finding inspiration and sometimes even finding myself in the same pose as her when I looked over. 
It was definitely an experience even though for the time being I still enjoy the guided practices more. But this one was important too.

6061.0,"I am 22 years old and this is my 8th year practicing yoga and my 4th year doing it with you Adriene, you don't know how much you have helped me through my journey of discovering my authentic self. 

Every year I get more and more excited about our 30 Day Journey as a community and every day I see myself getting better. I am not referring to the poses (though I have improved physically so, so much) but I am referring to the mindset.  

Especially with 'Breath', I have realized that finally, I have stopped trying to figure out the poses and my body, but I started to observe, to feel, and to get involved with the practice in a higher sense. It really is hard to describe, yet you have been explaining it perfectly, everyday bit by bit. 

Therefore,  I want to say thank you, you have no idea how much this journey's meant to us in such a crazy time like this, where everything is changing drastically every second...

And, I promise myself that when things get tough I WILL return to my breath and I will send you a silent 'Namaste'!..

Like Adriene so well-said every new breath is a chance for a new start.

Yesterday left quiet a bittersweet feeling lingering in my heart, but today? I felt so energiszd and hopeful !

It was just... perfect I can't imagine any other way to end this 30 day journey .
To feel and notice the unfolding of showing up everyday was mindblowing .

And it's totally untrue that ""all good thigns come to end"" ,I believe it  is  the beginning of an amazing journey for all of us .

 Adriene thank you from the bottom of my heart, for guiding us , accompanying us, and gifiting us this incredible experience. and Benji too for being there! 

I offer my thanks to all of the amazing people who accompanied each other during this journey

I wish you hapiness , success and above all HEALTH

You have blessed us both, and we can't appreciate you enough for it. Thank you, Adrian. Namaste",UgykpeKm8KJptCBCh0R4AaABAg,0.0,30.0,2021-01-31T06:01:26Z,0.9996310472488403

Thank you Adriene <3 I got so into it, that I even went ""overtime"", wasn't quite done with all the cooling down when the music stopped ^^ another beautiful journey over - another one just about to begin :) seriously, you have made my life so much better, ever since I found you when I just searched for ""yoga"" on Youtube - then it was motivated by it being so slippery outside that I couldn't go for a run; now I prefer yoga to running :)
(Did this on the membership earlier, that's how I'm already done - wishing you all a lot of fun and good times doing it here on Youtube, and sending much love and compassion <3)",Ugwjks9v5JJaQNcJVXV4AaABAg,0.0,12.0,2021-01-31T06:01:26Z,0.9771516919136047

Every time I come to the mat I find myself more-it’s because of you and these practices that have allowed me to do so, allowed me to slow down, allowed me to love myself just as I am and allowed me to be proud of myself for just showing up. 
You’re a true blessing to so many and I only wish you all the best throughout the rest of this year. 
I’ll keep showing up daily with all the wonderful practices you have available for us. Thank you again, Adriene.  “Breath” was beautiful!❤️💕❤️💕",UgyRqb3I92yr6icnc1t4AaABAg,12.0,115.0,2021-01-31T06:00:18Z,0.9997623562812805
