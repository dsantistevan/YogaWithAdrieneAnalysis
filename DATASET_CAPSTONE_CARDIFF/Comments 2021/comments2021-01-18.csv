312.0,"Day 17: HECK yes.

One thing that I really, truly value about these practices is that there's no way (short of skipping ahead in the video, but we don't do that here) to make them go any faster than they're going to go.  The practice is 32 minutes long, and whether I put my all into it or I slack off the whole time, I am still going to spend 32 minutes on this practice.  I have looked at the clock and determined that I have those 32 minutes to spend.  There is nowhere else for me to be in that time, and nowhere else I CAN be, and it takes so much pressure off my need to GO FAST.

Adriene said something early-ish in this practice about how we weren't technically doing ratio breathing, but we could think about it, and I think that ended up being incredible for my focus and presence in this session today.  By speeding up my breathing in a rhythmic way sometimes, I was able to slow it down others, without feeling caught or behind or desperate.  No, I wasn't always exactly on pace with Adriene all practice.  I was on pace with MYSELF, in a steady sort of way that felt really really good.  (Isn't it amazing how, when I do the breath things that this entire sequence is about doing, the sequence goes better.)

A really good yoga day.  We're a couple of days behind and we're going to stay a couple of days behind, and maybe I'm going to move to every other day or five days a week or whatever for the second half of the month, but I'm doing it for ME.

360.0,"I have been using your videos since the start of the pandemic when I was living alone during lockdown. They have continued to help me bring about more mindfulness, focus, clarity, and calmness to my life since then. I often catch myself when I am feeling stressed, tired or tense and try these breathing exercises, relax my shoulders, jaw and forehead, and instantly feel relief. Tonight I was doing Day 17 and wanted to share my experience. I felt like I had mastered the pose of low lunge with the twist where we raise our arm up the sky (you have it in many videos). But in this video, you explained how we should squeeze our thighs in and feel our pelvis lift half an inch or so. I couldn't believe how much higher I felt off the ground! One simple move of two muscles and I experienced a dramatic shift in this pose. Your words about finding more space in our moves at first was sort of hard for me to understand. But tonight, in this moment, it seemed to click! I am starting to experience taking up space in different ways, and being more mindful of how my body is feeling and moving at all times. I think this is one of the many reasons why you are so amazing and provide so many people with a great yoga practice - you always know the right thing to say! The right funny thought that we are all currently thinking or addressing the feeling we are all currently experiencing. Or in this case, one small alteration to a move that brings about a huge difference! I know this is a long comment, but I just wanted to share and say how much I appreciate your videos and what you have done for my mental and physical health.

Breathing properly has always been so difficult for me to do naturally.

I just got an understanding of it, that I have only glimpsed before, and I am learning to use it in other situations. (For example when having an old filling removed and replaced! Not exactly a relaxing situation! I kept tensing up, then becoming conscious of it, and using breath to relax again.

Such a pivotal thing, that I have had head knowledge of, but never really been able to do, now learning.
It's so exciting to be at the beginning of it, knowing it's going to keep growing into different areas of my life.

Battling depression has left me with a habit of ‚Äòmood monitoring‚Äô, which when really low, always seemed a bit pointless. Therapy discourages one from just accepting how you are at a given moment, attributing a negativity to low mood, but positivity to better mood, unless it swings too far to being manic. So, through therapy, was taught that mood is linear, aiming for 0- neither positive nor negative.
Through this practice, and with Adrienne‚Äôs thought provoking guidance, I now know that this is not the case and I am ‚Äòallowed‚Äô to just notice, leaving me calm and grateful, and able to carry that off the mat.

I have been feeling lately that there is this culture of self-numbing brewing - an extreme coping mechanism which hardens us to emotions, sensitivity and authenticity, the things that cause us to overflow and react to this turbulent world climate we live in right now, which we can't do because we'll lose that strong facade we need to be able to get through these days of isolation, loneliness, monotony, struggle.¬†

The idea of exploring the combustible, fire-y, passionate parts of you without ""freaking out"" by keeping the breath present and involved in your movement spoke massively to me... and it's going to be what helps me come out of this pandemic with my emotional, feeling, compassionate self in tact, and not a robotic shell of my former self!

Everyday the one thing I dedicate the most is study. The rest is just wasted time, not doing what's best for me. I get lazy and I procrastinate, but only when it's about me. I am done with that. This yoga journey can't be the only thing I am doing for myself. Even when I practice yoga I almost have to do everything perfectly at times, or I will get angry at myself. This is not fair... This is it, I've had enough! Today's practice made me come to a huge realization. I hope I don't sound to angry to anyone reading this.

587.0,"I feel heavy today. It's not a good heavy or a bad heavy--as I suppose anything isn't good or bad, it just is what we decide it is--but heavy. My days feel like a minefield. I'm so grateful for what I have, and I also feel weighted with just...more nowadays. It's not just a trip to the grocery store to pick up some toilet paper and fruit. It's a choice to enter a risk-filled environment which requires a kind of hyper-vigilance that immediately shrinks my joy and -- my breath, most of the time. I felt my mind beg me to return to a deeper breath today in the car, unprompted. That's an improvement. I was also anxious enough one night this week, worried about my dog and possible health problems, that I needed to take my on-hand anti-anxiety medication. I'm trying to accept all of this, to let it come and go. But the longer this pandemic lasts, the harder it feels to maintain my own sense of balance and safety. That's what it is. I don't feel safe.

Over time, this creates significant bodily imbalance that can take months if not years to recover from. I'm a yoga instructor, I know how hard it is to make sure that you perform the same sequence with the same timing on both sides. But it is so vitally important to make sure you do so, especially for beginners who are developing the muscular mobility, flexibility, and strength. This is not specific to this video or to Adriene, I see it all the time live and online, and I think as teachers and students it's something we have to be extra mindful of as we explore into new postures and moments!",Ugy4i3AjNFHJFwWv_xJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-18T14:26:52Z,0.9567934274673462
