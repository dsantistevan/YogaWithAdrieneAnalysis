228.0,"Comment for me only: You have avoided Yoga for more than 20 years. But the truth is - it is because it values and requires skill in every weakness you feel you have. Patience, strength, being connected to your inner self, taking time/care for yourself/facing truths. There is no class you need to avoid. There is no time limit on this. If a 5 minutes class is all you have - then DO IT ANYWAY. Autism and ADHD and PTSD and fresh grief of a parent and a complete life overhaul are a lot for any human who can't tolerate medication and has no support network, but that still leaves you with the same issue. No one will dig you out. All I ask from you is 30 days. 30 days of committing to doing what SOMEONE ELSE TELLS YOU TO with some semblance of grace. For how ever long your body can take that day. Just be present. Yoga is the only physical way we have to self assess our own mental health and it is time to get some answers in the peace.

But I carried on and carrying on is always better than quitting and I'm proud of myself. Thank you Adriene, for introducing me to guided excercises that I enjoy. Your voice is something to look forward to. And if I had to force myself on the mat, you encourage me to carry on and calm my soul. Thanky you.
Yoga is the only excercise I'm doing right now and I'm trying to stick with it this time around. Here's to Breath, and maybe taking less days for the 30 day journey than previously.

665.0,"I decided to start this today. I'd consider myself a beginner. It's been over a year since I've done any serious exercise, and my condition is pretty poor. I'll talk about my experiences.
First of all, it was way more difficult than I was expecting. Just sitting down in that cross-legged position, my upper back was absolutely killing me. When we started doing some actual movement, my legs and arms were shaking all over the place. Maintaining a rhythm with the breathing didn't really succeed in the slightest. I had to fight extremely hard to be able to do the lunges at all. I couldn't reach very far at all, and clearly have almost no flexibility. I could barely raise my arms in a steady motion. Pretty pathetic, I have to say. 

However, after we actually were done, I felt amazing. All the back pain was completely gone after this, after just one session. My legs felt tired, in that good way. I feel like I got a serious cardio workout and was completely out of breath even if it feel like I didn't really do anything. And I also wasn't bored at any point, in fact the 48 minutes just flew by. Definitely more interesting than doing treadmill for half an hour or something like that. 

Quite impressed, we'll see how day 2 goes tomorrow. Hopefully slightly better.",Ugzf1ANyV3pR820I_Tp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-05-09T20:59:40Z,-0.9897318482398987

I tried various exercises but I could not find the right way to do yoga and truly rejuvenate my body until I found this channel. While doing this practice, I found out how much of my flexibility I've lost. Like, while doing the tabletop position my wrists could not hold up, and I'm only 17.

691.0,"Starting this journey and will make updates so I can stay committed  :) always saw people do this I‚Äôm excited to try 

Day 1 : I was shaking a lot after 30 mins, I didn‚Äôt think yoga would be physically challenging at all, or maybe I‚Äôm just really out of shape. I had difficulty holding a few positions but I expect my strength to increase over time. I really enjoyed being present in each moment and being intentional with each breath, my mood feels noticeably better :)


Day 2: seem a little easier and quicker :) I think I improved a tiny bit and as for my mood today it‚Äôs okay , I‚Äôm not happy nor sad. I‚Äôm content :)

Day 3 : was still a bit challenging but I do sense a tiny improvement in my strength in holding these positions. My mood is the same as yesterday. Namaste üôèüèº

769.0,"I was intimidated by the length of the video since I hadn‚Äôt done yoga consistently for a while. I‚Äôm so glad I did it anyway. I struggle a lot with dissociating and depersonalization, and your yoga practices help me so much to be present in my body, to forgive myself, to love myself. Last year I did it much more consistently, and it helped me heal from an eating disorder I‚Äôd had for a decade for that reason. I was able to be present in my body, ask for forgiveness and give forgiveness. I recently was diagnosed with bipolar, and I am trying to start my practice again, because I have been so overwhelmed and angry with my mind and body again. I feel angry that the depression I felt isn‚Äôt going to go away. But yoga reminds me so much to be gentle, to forgive, and to be in this moment. At the end of this video, when we were in corpse pose, I heard the birds outside my window, and I really heard them, as well as feeling my own breath. It‚Äôs the most present I‚Äôve felt in so long and I just started crying because I felt like I had come home. Thank you for all you do and the work you do to help heal people with your spirit of gentleness, and introducing yoga in an approachable and inclusive way.

859.0,"Hi! I'm from the future (day 16) and I wanted to share my (summarized) experience with this journey so far. I'm gonna copy paste a comment I posted on day 15 in case someone needs a bit of motivation:

_‚ÄúI noticed how has my body and mind had changed since I started this journey. I feel better, calmer. I don't get angry so easily, and I'm more aware of my body. I think I look prettier than before, but I don't know if that's cause of the yoga itself or it's me that's changing. My shoulders are a bit sore, but I feel stronger. It's easier for me to sit with my back straight (because I'm an artist and I spend hours hunched over the table, painting or drawing) and this is helping me a lot with that. Now I'm more cheerful than before. Today I found myself dancing and singing alone in the kitchen while doing the dishes, smiling and feeling so energetic! I love this feeling. I think that now I'm gonna add this beautiful and wholesome habit to my daily routine for the rest of my life, cause this is absolutely perfect for my mind and body. Every time I finish one practice, I look forward to the next one.‚Äù_",Ugz7naC_jQJdpsK5-Pd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-04-07T02:22:16Z,0.9994402527809143

1. Both are amazing teachers. You will learn a lot. 
2. Adriene's is more spiritual and mental. She highly encourages you to take your time and tune into your body. Hence a lot more breathing, positive affirmations, overall slowe and mindful moving. You will feel positive and balanced. Meditetitive. 
3. Tim's is about more body building and conscious movement. He gives good advices about our body anatomy and how not to 'abuse' our body. Transitions are faster and more strength building oriented. You will feel energized and positive. 

My advice: If you are new to yoga, I advise you to start with Adriane's and continue to Tim's. f you are pretty good at yoga, I would mix them day by day. Great variation of mind and body focus.",Ugyw7Qxnlu1XvWbQRWp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-02T00:01:20Z,0.9997785687446594

I have completed Revolution, Dedicate, True, Yoga Camp, 30 Days of Yoga, Home... I think. Each and every of these programmes was a little bit different and each was amazing. 
And this one is starting also amazing.
 I loved how we had to stay a little longer in plank and twists in lunges... it was quite challenging for me but also so refreshing and putting things in perspective.
I have been practising with you for 5 years (I even recorded a video about this but I would add so many new things now ;)) and every practise with you teaches me something new. I am confident enough to say that you, Adriene, became sort of my spiritual guide. Your videos resonate with me on another level. It always is exactly what I need. You taught me so much. I am so excited but also humbled to join you on another journey.

I sat on the ground for over three hours watching the Lord of the Rings (extended) with some friends last night, so I'm especially glad to work through some of the tightness from that haha! Sometimes deep breaths are hard. Anxious feelings and flutterings catch on the breath, making it more shallow and uneven. Syncing my breath with movement is so helpful for me to find greater space in my lungs and torso, and I think that is what drew me here. Also, I'm seeing so many comments saying they're late...but I think you're right on time! It is good for you _when_ever you are.

Anyone have any tips for getting around this? I am working on weight loss but it's a slower journey for me this time around.

anyway all this was to say I really love when a class has a few moments dedicated to wrists. It‚Äôs such a delicate part of the body which one doesn‚Äôt realize until they‚Äôve got pain there.

2613.0,"I did it. Day 1. I feel proud. It was more challenging than I thought it would be, taking it slow and being really intentional. Part of me is honestly scared of committing to the 30 days because if I don't complete it, ""I'll feel shame and it will be evidence that I can't stick to a goal"" (says the part that is afraid of failure and that equates my self worth with what I do or don't do). It would be a big shift from hardly doing any movement (other than walks) to 45 minutes of yoga EVERY DAY. And, I think, the research on building habits says to start small...like teeny tiny. 

But what if I treated this like an experiment? How will it feel, what will I notice, what changes might arise if I did this thing I've never done before? It could be an opportunity to practice self-compassion, gently encouraging myself to step on the mat even when I don't want to. And cheering myself on to return to the mat if I miss a day for some reason (which is likely to happen).  I've been wanting to get my body moving for a while now...so I'm going to try it. 

Thanks for the opportunity to think that through! I'm grateful to Adriene and to all of you.",UgxCk4uQ9f62raHv0ol4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-09T15:32:38Z,0.9888986945152283

2679.0,"Last year I started your 30 days yoga journey in March, when the lockdown started here in Moscow... Not a beginner, but certainly not a regular or advanced yogi. After that journey I kept practicing yoga with you regularly, often on a daily basis. It gave me so much on every level and helped me stay healthy and focused during this very strange year. I started 2021 with a relocation to a new apartment, so after very busy and exciting days only today I am starting this year yoga journey... A little late, but with the resolution to take it all and do my best. New apartment, same old yoga mat and same wonderful Adriene.

2749.0,"just started this journey today and i feel so good about it! though i wanted to start this on the 1st, the beginning of this year started out pretty rough. from the end of 2020, my mindset for the new year was to ""heal myself from everything from my past"" and ""manifest/grow into the person i want to be"", to work even harder for the things that i want, but after breaking down every single day, i realized that i set up so many expectations for myself and had put too many things on my plate- in just 5 days! i don't want 2021 to just be huge to-do list, but i just wanted to change so bad and outgrow my old habits. but after talking things through with the people closest to me, i realized that healing/growth will come naturally- when you're fixated on just that, you miss out on enjoying the smallest moments. i'll heal and grow without even realizing it once i start enjoying life. today's practice definitely reminded me to ""LET GO"" and be present, to be mindful and patient. just wanted to share in case anyone was going through the same thing! i love this uplifting community so much that it made me want to share my experience- first time commenting on any youtube video lol, but we got this!",Ugz7917o413i3Lyoxlh4AaABAg,1.0,13.0,2021-01-07T19:27:27Z,0.9978025555610657

2809.0,"If you've also come to this ""late,"" you are not alone :) one of my mentors says ""we are right where we are supposed to be.""
I was introduced to YWA years ago. I would call myself a ""lapsed yogi."" A friend invited me to this yesterday, and while my initial thought was to be annoyed because ""now I'm already 'behind'"" it was so quickly followed by gratitude. I have been looking for a ""good enough"" reason to get moving with yoga again and a friend inviting me was perfect. I must say, I think this might be the first 30-day challenge where I sincerely want to commit, do every single day's vid. even if i skip a day of the week I will continue to the next so it might take me a while to get through this, maybe not all in a row, but that's ok... being gentle with myself.
I found it helpful to reach a bunch of the comments before partaking on this journey. I felt more inspired and like I could actually do this if so many others could. I especially loved reading about how so many people were able to commit based on one person sharing that they were surprised when they saw 48 minutes (super long for YWA) but did it anyway and felt amazing. It's really neat too to see so many people commenting and sharing from all around the world (hello to you from Pennsylvania, USA!) Thank you all for sharing your experiences.
Here are mine:
- did this before bed, and it was appropriate. I was concerned I would be too jazzed, but I'm feeling pretty zen RN. Like I could get ready for bed no prob.
- looooooooved that this one has a savasana. many YWA vids don't which is not my preference. 
- about 33 minutes in I had to pause, I think I had too much fluid in my sinuses, (maybe due to lapsed yoga practice I haven't spent nearly that much time upside-down lately?) and got a sharp pain shooting up my forehead (but I made it through the rest of the practice just fine - breaks are good)
- one note of suggestion, that I hope gets enacted throughout the rest of the month's practices - I would love for the pauses, for the moments we are encouraged to breathe, to be a little more extended, so that I can actually focus on listening to myself breathe for a few breaths. By the time Adriene was talking again I had barely had a chance to do that, and so it felt a little rushed. 
- Otherwise, I loved it and am really curious and excited to see where this takes me, and us as a community who are all partaking. 

Thank you Adriene for making this so accessible! You are doing more than your fair share in helping to repair this broken world <3",Ugwy44xfiY1HlbCKFpd4AaABAg,0.0,3.0,2021-01-07T03:09:23Z,0.6133388222357985

Finally found the time to start this 30 Day journey and realized how much tension I was holding on my upper back for some of these moves and was starting to get frustrated that some moves were quite difficult but I had to be gentle and patient with myself as I am a beginner to the practice (it‚Äôs been 2 years since I‚Äôve taken my last yoga class) and that my body is also dealing with the grief of my grandma‚Äôs death. So at the end when Adriene said to let go, I found myself releasing some tears as I had been trying to hold it together for my family, especially for my dad who has been heavily affected by the loss of his mother. But I‚Äôm so glad I committed through today‚Äôs video and it was a great way to bring me back to the present (and realize how out of shape I am lol) so thank you, Adriene if you ever read this.

It has transformed our lives. We're hooked.When I saw that you were starting this new Breath 30 day yoga  I knew I had to give it a go daily.

She incorperates the breath and mindfulness in a way that those who have not been raised or taught to have a particularly spiritual mindset can wrap their heads around and imerse themselves in, without negating the mindfulness of the practice. Yoga is so much more than streatching and so many western practices chalk it down to a gym class.

To start this next journey with all you already brings a great store of transcendence that will carry me through the less than harmonious moments in this journey that I know will come, because everything is a wave.

We ultimately have the power to decide our fates with everything or nothing we are given. I feel so blessed to have this freely given resource, the opportunity to develop this relationship with myself, our teacher, Adriene, and all of you developing together with me. Whether you practice day by day, a few days late like me, or stumble upon this weeks, months, or years from now, we are all in this together. We are all here, in our moment as we land on the mat, as one. This connection will follow us, moment to moment throughout our lives, often unacknowledged, but powerful and enduring nonetheless.

During the video, there was many points where I had to pause or go back to a mountain pose or child pose cause my body parts hurt or would be shaking too much. I felt like I couldn't do it. But something about the instructor kept me going. She is so encouraging and funny at points. Eventually I got to the end of the video and holy moly do I feel good.

Being a writer I need to be around other creatives and live in a place that isn't suffocating and stress inducing like Vegas was for me.

I guess what I wanna know is from a locals perspective, how does Austin rank as a city for an outdoor enthusiast with an artistic side. Is there a thriving writers community? How is the gay community and is Austin welcoming of those in the LBGTQ community?

I love your yoga videos, they're so calming but I have one request.

4089.0,"I started doing yoga with Adriene during the lockdown. I got lost after completing two and a half 30-day journeys cause life got in the way.

Last year, I applied for grad schools, took exams and suffered from anxiety. I remember thinking to myself how yoga has helped me with my flexibility and balance, but also my mental stability and health. Now, having my sh*t back on track, I try to find my precious time for yoga each morning.

But, even then, I would imagine how it would feel to do yoga with so many people at the same time. Now, my first new year resolution is doing yoga together with the Yoga with Adriene community! Who's with me for 30 days? üòç 

 I will be a proud part of this amazing and supportive community throughout our journey together! I cannot wait to inhale and exhale with you!

One thing I have learned is not to force anything.  I remember this summer, I got frustrated that I was not getting flexible fast enough.  I decided I wasn't try hard enough and pressed forward as hard as I could, until it was painful.  Then I heard a pop and my back was sore for two weeks, lol.  Today, when Adriene said to twist my wrist around I started doing it, only made it halfway and my wrists told me this was a no go.  So I listened, and I happily did what I could.

I felt a really deep connection to this practice and I can really feel the love and energy you put into it - palpably. My mom passed a few days ago and the funeral was today - feeling completely numb and drained I just wanted to lay in bed but got my butt to the mat and pushed play. I‚Äôm so glad I did. I cried the whole first half of the practice but continued to listen to your cues and notice everything you suggested to notice. As the practice picked up I was able to get out of my head and really be present in the flow and surrender - truly a miracle after the week I‚Äôve been having and this fresh grief. I‚Äôm left with peace and deep gratitude for all the free practices and programs you and your team have shared with the world. Truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

 I'm so glad I took the time for myself and stuck with it, I feel like promises you make to yourself are the hardest to keep, but I promised myself I'm going to show up on the mat every day this month, and I hope everyone around the world will join in and we'll all take this journey together!

Let me just start with how beautiful your new place is, love the fact that more natural light come in from the glasses. I am inspired to do something similar as a small outdoor room actually. 

As for the yoga session (lol) I found myself slowly remembering the motion, sometimes I just jump into the next move as second nature. 
Day 1, not bad!

4948.0,"Hello. In the¬†past I have considered myself more an avid trail runner and Qigong practitioner, having tried yoga only a few times in a gym. They have a yoga¬†teacher at my alternative public high school where I provide Special Education. I often sit on a yoga ball in class as do many of my students because it is so good for¬†your core in comparison to being at a traditional desk all day. However, since the pandemic began enjoying the outdoors for me has sometimes been a bit more challenging. I have tried various 30 day yoga challenges via Amazon since March 13, 2020 to¬†keep me healthy both in mind and body. Some I completed in 30 days, others I did not. It was not until late August 2020 that I discovered Yoga with Adriene. At first her¬†practice seemed too easy in comparison to the other challenges I had completed. I had read comments from other¬†practitioners mentioning that they use Yoga with Adriene as a supplement and often add something else. However, every time I completed a different 30 day Yoga with Adriene, at the conclusion I have felt just right. For me not only has it ignited a passion for yoga, but it has brought something for me to share with others during these very uncertain and stressful times. Thank you Adriene and Benji, you have both converted me. I now also consider myself a daily yoga practitioner! I am sincerely looking forward to this journey every day in 2021. Namaste, Edward

Listen to my wonderful teacher, myself and the environment around me. Respecting myself for showing up.

I‚Äôd gone home on my dinner break and prepared a breakfast I could take with me on the road the next day after this first video, set my alarms so I would wake up early enough to do this - I‚Äôd committed to give myself this gift. Then four am hit and my replacement still wasn‚Äôt there after an hour and they were scrambling to find somebody to match me. I made it home, caught a few hours of sleep, and woke up just early enough to do this first video. All that to say, I am SO grateful I did.

So DAY1: It was awesome, I was so energetic and excited to get on my mat, and when we fully started at about 6minutes, I was even more pumped. Lol. Today was very amazing cause I've really missed yoga a lot, it's quite easier for me to follow a schedule. Then again, I started getting weak, more like shaky during the plank, lower lunge and down ward facing dog poses because of my weak left arm, the elbow is bent and also completing some of Adrienne sentences or guessing what pose comes next because of how integral this has become to me, it's my 4th year and I'm glad to be here...but I remember vividly at the ending Adrienne said something 'embarking on this journey for YOURSELF' and I hold that as a mantra through this year's journey because I can only be better for me, to be better for others, which is one of my resolutions for the new year. So all in all I'm so glad and honoured to be doing this with over millions of people world-wide. With hands clasped together I say a Happy New Year to everyone and Namaste.üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è",UgzpPOn9V1ChCmsTlEV4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2021-01-02T22:14:17Z,0.998166561126709

5067.0,"I invited my mom to today's practice and she joined me. We had an interruption after the first yoga lunge, and she said I could go ahead and finish on my own. Having done the 30 days of yoga last year, I had an inkling the hardest part was nearly over, and invited her to finish with me. 
She did and she said she had fun, and she was glad she did it with me. ^_^
I love all the direction and guidance you give; it gives me confidence I can invite yoga newbies to join me and they won't over extend or hurt themselves, and I also always am able to go deeper by following it! I'm so happy to be getting back into yoga now that allergy season is past, which put a temporary pause on it last year. xD (I kept trying, but just ""drowned"" every time I did a forward fold.) 
Also, during the final ""corpse pose"" silent moment, my dog was making slumbering noises. <3",Ugym9fgLsfbHc_rJv7B4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-02T22:07:27Z,0.9976968169212341

I only did yoga maybe a few times between then and now, but I knew I wanted to do the 30 day challenge. I have to say, it was definitely hard to show up today. I found myself thinking, maybe I'll do it in an hour, and I had to tell myself that if I didn't get on the mat right then it would never get done because one hour would turn into two, then I would be getting ready for bed and realize I never rolled out my mat at all. Showing up really is the hardest part. Once I heard Adriene's voice I was hooked in. It was lovely to hear her usual phrases and sayings (hey-oh!) and to feel my body naturally fall back into poses and rhythms it had learned for months previously. Although it's definitely harder to hold the poses for me now, and I found my body getting tired more quickly than it used to, I really enjoyed doing this practice. It's like hanging out with an old friend after months apart. While it was hard to initially show up, I'm definitely glad that I did, and look forward to showing up the rest of the month as well!

I scrolled comments for a while trying to find commiseration and didn't see anyone else who was frustrated. My back locked up around minute 23, and I had to pause the video and figure out how to stretch myself so I could move again. I had a good cry and started again. But within minutes it was moving too quickly for me to follow and to understand what I was supposed to be doing. I never could figure out if my body was doing the right things. I'm a beginner, and I thought this would be good for beginners, but that was a mistake. So just - if this wasn't a great experience for you - if you struggled or failed or cried or gave up - you aren't the only one. Hugs to you.

I started a new job 5 months ago and started a meditation practice around the same time, and have really neglected yoga in the meantime. It was interesting to see how different it is for me with my body now having aches and pains from work, and with a better relationship to my breath. I was very intimidated by the length of today's session - I often start to feel disconnected during longer sessions and feel very antsy. Not so today! We'll see how the next few weeks go - I don't think it'll be easy practicing consistently while working a tiring job as well. But I do hope I keep up with it, in my own time at least. I'm looking forward to this year's theme! I've been enjoying ywa videos for six years, and I'm so happy to see the ever growing community and enthusiasm.

I find the more slower practices where you move slower, breathe deeper and focus more to be the most challenging (but are DEFINITELY probably) the most beneficial for me.

I already can tell this will be challenging but I know it is going to help me grow as a little yogi (I decided GROWTH is my intention) and will change me for the better.

Let me know if anyone else felt this is a bit challenging too. We just got to show up... we can do this.

6819.0,"I'm very hypermobile (to the point dislocations are just a regulat thing- potential hEDS y'know... diagnosis takes a long time), faint often if I'm too active or upright too long, anxious and paranoid as it gets etc etc y'know the whole package- and haven't done yoga for a long time due to the way it was destabalising my joints and causing pain (originally it was what I was recommended as I had chronic pain, but as I've found it's due to hypermobility, I've been advised to stay away from it unless I stay aware of my joints), but I'm gonna try and do this yoga journey not just for breath but to maybe become more aware of how I move my body during exercise- something I miss after having to stop dancing and martial arts in my teenage years and would love to get more active now I'm in my 20s, and especially after the past year I've had, hopefully find a little tiny bit of peace. It was really difficult trying to be aware of my joints, aware of my breath, and trying to stay stable in any position, and I had to pause and rest often, if I found myself too shakey, amend my position if I found I was over extending my joints, alter poses to protect my fingers or knees, etc., but it's only day one, and thought it took me twice as long as the video is, I'll see how it goes. But it is quite difficult to find length and not overextend and that's something I hope I can get better at.",UgwgWiZdSpIMg5fYXqJ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-02T16:26:06Z,-0.8658104538917542

7394.0,"I think it was about two years ago now, that you truly inspired me to invest in myself, invest in a mat and keep on showing up to it as often as possible. 

At that time I had recently started to get out of a long period of illness that had me bedridden for a few years. I was tired, weak, depressed, overweight and desperate to find back to life and movement. 

Two years in and showing up to my mat with your voice guiding me is still a favourite part of my day. I have lost nearly 20 kg. I have become so much stronger and gained stamina. I now go on serious hiking, which is my next favourite activity after yoga. I have found back to my art and even had my first solo exhibition last fall, which did better that what I would ever imagine. I have found so many tools to deal with my chronic illness that I now feel certain that it will never ruin my life again. And I have found so much playfulness in my body that I have regained the childlike vigour that I honestly believe is a key to true happiness. All of this with your voice guiding me through.

I was so excited for this year's program that I dreamt about it all last night ü§£ 

I have so much gratitude for you Adriene, eternally and ethereal. I would love to send you one of my artworks as a way to share my gratitude and love with you. Take a look at my IG account the_potent_enigma, if you find anything there that speaks to you DM me, and I will mail it to you.

7463.0,"Sadly couldn‚Äôt join you live as just to early for me personally. I started yoga about 1 yr before lockdown here in the uk (3-2020 as mum is high risk) because I have a disabling back injury and so many of the exercises were things my physio, who I was seeing every week, was doing. It meant it freed him up to do other things and I discovered how much I loved it. I tried to carry it on myself in lockdown but I just couldn‚Äôt remember enough and to be honest it is helpful in my situation having a real live person giving alternatives for things I can‚Äôt do. But when I found you I just loved the way you spoke and had been waiting for you to do another one of these 30 day sessions. I found today real hard, but I adjusted the things I needed to and preserved. I know from experience now that it is hard but it pays off and that there were things today that I had got to the point of them being ‚Äòeasy‚Äô before so I know we can get there again if I work at it. And that‚Äôs the hardest bit I think as it‚Äôs so easy just to not bother. So I am pledging to everyone here to do my best and I hope that there will be community here that will help hold us up to persevering.

7506.0,"Showing up today was hard. Really hard. I think I procrastinated for about an hour before taking the courage to lay down my mat and click play on the video. I've been doing yoga for 3 years now, but in 2020, and I don't think I was the only one, I fell into this deep state of pure anxiety/depression/panic, and I just couldn't bring myself to do anything that was good for me, including yoga. It's been at least 10 months since I got on the mat, and today I decided to help myself, and allow myself to feel something good after so many months of frustration. I actually injured my right wrist a few weeks ago, and I was a little scared of doing the practice, but how funny, I felt pain for a few moments and now, after completing the practice, it actually feels better (btw, if anyone has any tips for wrist injures, I accept them lol). Point is, if you've been away for a long time, like me, and is scared to get back into it, don't be. Take it easy and allow yourself to feel good :)",UgxdqteZOOSXzfnPdvF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-02T14:13:44Z,-0.9821264147758484

As I sit here, facing the wonderful and promising next chapters of my life, I actually have tears of gratitude streaming down my cheeks. Life has been a pretty incredible journey thus far, and the addition of your calming presence and guidance is equipping me to continue on this path of self-care, self-discovery, and self-enlightenment.  I just wish to thank you sincerely for the dedication you show your community. I can't begin to express the impact you've had on me in the last year since I've discovered your channel. You truly are a special soul and I'm so grateful to able to follow your guidance on my journey to becoming the best version of myself. Your channel is a big part of this journey, so thank you again...Namaste.",UgyktIeCk5gwufq1GUR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-02T14:10:32Z,0.9996984004974365

7609.0,"Heeyy to myself ^^  ~~  
to be honest at first the 48 mins mark scared the shit out of me , but then this is Adriene i'm practicing with, and i know it's gonna be a fun ride, totally worth every second, 

and not like i was doing some EXTRAORDINARY things with my time to begin with
in the contrary, i'll be doing myself a big favor by sticking to this journey ^_____^ i know it !! i'll stick to it this time for sure (insha-allah) , because, and even tho i'm ashamed to say it, i have tried the other journeys Adriene made for us, but i've always fell behind and end up not picking the mat, making myself sink a little further in disappointment in my own self , and losing other pieces of my confidence , which accumulates with other failures , and promises that i broke with myself , making me unconsciously believe that i'm just a full of talk loser, this despair will eventually blind my eyes towards other aspects of my life , where i shined brightly, where i stood up so strong, where i pulled myself together, it made me blind to the other hopeful and full of color parts of my life, it made me feel like my happiness is only in the faaaaaaaaaar future , which is so faaaaaaaaar that i won't even move to make it happen; 

i won't let myself fall in that trap again, NEVER; since i decided , and i committed to prove to myself how much of an outstanding, incredible and full of miracles person that i am, ONLY if i gave myself the chance she NEEDS and the time it deserves to showcase that potential, to bring that future that seemed so far away right in front of her, right in from of YOU MERIEM ^^ 
and to your surprise Mereim , the JOURNEY is fun too ^__^ you gonna enjoy every step you take because it's for yourself , and because finally moving towards your dreams is so beautiful ^^ ~~
 
what if you fall you ask? well i'll pick you up right the next day, week or even two weeks, maybe even month, in the end that too is just part of the beautiful journey we embarked in, and in the future it'll make the picture even more beautiful and magical; look at all the failures i made up till now , do i hate them ? hell no , they were part of me , they make me , so what makes slacking a week any different than slacking for years ?? ... it's actually more reasonable to hold each others hand and get back to our journey , to the road to our beautiful future as quick , as determined and as happy and excited as possible ^^


So yeaah~~ i need to renew my commitment every day (as much as possible) , i need to show up on to the mat and commit to this journey full-heartedly, to see the "" my self ""  the ""Meriem"" after this month who finished the whole journey , along side my other 2 commitments that i made with myself ( learning Graphic Design and Draw a box ) so then it'll be our 1st BIG step towards our dreams and our beautiful future 

and what is better that having Adriene and all the other beautiful people towards the world that i know have similar and different reasons to show up to practice with me and with us, it's just the perfect recipe that anyone would ask for to get back on my dream's road :)

and i'm confident to say : "" if it's me i know i can do it ; i will do it for me  , i'll do it for you Meriem ; i'm my own hero , I'M YOUR HERO MERIEM, TRUST ME . "" 

so YEAAH!!~~ that was about it ^^ i'm so happy, excited and committed to show to myself how an incredible person i am, *she is a strong BITCH !!* LOL
 
Lastly, THANK YOU Adriene for giving me a chance, to at least show this type of commitment to myself, and a chance address this inner conflicts that i didn't really get to address . 
i LOVE YOU SO MUCH and can't wait to practice with you, Namaste ~~ <3 .",UgwEUCQC0v6L-0nw0p14AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-02T13:52:19Z,0.4735051060567435

Doing it in a circular motion was a revelation. Can't wait to see what else I learn on this journey. THANK YOU ADRIENE. We are lucky to have you.

As a graphic designer, I also want to give a shoutout to the artist who designed the BREATH logo and selected (or perhaps even designed?) the font for the titles.

I spent most of yesterday feeling my entire back aching for some movement, after a considerable lack thereof the past few weeks, and slow and steady was just the ticket. I also surprised myself by how easy lowering to the belly from plank felt. My wrists felt surprisingly fine, until I did the self-massage and I notice a slight soreness on pressure. Gentle is the way forward.

But most importantly, I could feel my mind still. I've been easily annoyed and irritable lately, and coming back to the mat gave me the space to recognise, accept and let go.

I have always found it disheartening that runners‚Äô lunges are impossible for me, because my chest getting in the way means my arms absolutely cannot reach over my knee to the floor. The distance of my shin, plus my chest on top of it is longer than my arms! Hope that makes sense.

7849.0,"Inviting the listening.
I always do this short meditation right before a YWA video.
1- I sit cross legged breathing slow with eyes soft
2- list what each of my senses is perceiving.(outside)
3- then I scan my body for any physical sensations (inside)
4- then I scan my emotions and thoughts.(deeper inside).
5- based on my thoughts or emotions I then make my intention.
Today‚Äôs thoughts were ‚ÄúNew Years, gonna eliminate all the bad things and take on more good things- self work!!!!  Self betterment!!!! Gonna be perfect!!!!‚Äù

This practice was tough for me. I used to practice yoga a lot, but have been absent from my mat for over a year. I was filled with thoughts about how I used to be much ""better"" at it, use to be much stronger, etc...so I was feeling a bit down about myself. But throughout the practice, I kept remembering your teaching of ""honoring where you are"". That kept me breathing and moving forward.
I am where I am today, and I am very excited to see where the journey takes me over the next 30 days (especially because it aligns almost perfectly with my last month of veterinary school)!

I am hugging you all!!!! <3 I did yoga with Adriene almost every day since March 2020 and something funny happened to me. 3 weeks ago I decided to go to a yoga studio for a beginners handstand workshop and I HATTTEEEED it so much... I suddenly felt so disconnected from my practice. It was so so physical, like every girl trying to achieve and do all these crazy asanas perfectly... and for me, yoga has a lot to do with spirituality, and with the fact it makes me connect with myself, and my body and my breath. And to accept me and my boundaries. Since then I felt so discouraged and I barely haven't practiced yoga. I was feeling pretty bad about it. So I want this journey to be a journey home again, to love yoga and overall, to love my practice and the way I understand yoga. I am excited.

I'm finally ready to work on my mental health and yoga is one of the things I am focusing on. I've done yoga casually the past few years, but never stuck with it long enough to see any results, and I was never in the headspace to care. But now as the depression fog lifts, I find myself wanting to feel strong instead of just saying I'm strong. This will be the first challenge I've been a part of as it happens and it will be the first challenge I intend to finish, and beyond. 

I am grateful to you Adriene, Benji and the Find What Feels Good team, for creating a beautiful community for people and all the different challenges they face, to have a space to just be and feel some sense of peace. And have quite a few laughs along the way. 

Here's to many more hey-ohs, full bottle experiences and baggy sweater love caves.

8230.0,"Day 1: I have never done a yoga class before. Your channel was recommended in a newsletter from Caitlin DeSilva and I have always wanted to try yoga so I thought I would give this challenge a try. As a bigger person I couldn't touch my toes or the mat, I had a hard time being in the plank positions and nearly gave up twice. However, I promised myself I would commit this year, so I altered some movements to suit me and even looked to Benji to help me on this journey. Overall I committed, I didn't give up on this challenge and I didn't give up on myself and I'm so excited to continue my journey with you all.

Day 2: WHAT IS THIS! I woke up this morning in a Euphoric glow. I felt happy, confident in my body that normally feels like a prison. I was alert and focused and craving my workout and yoga class? It‚Äôs only day 2 but I‚Äôm sad when class ends. I still can‚Äôt do most positions but I‚Äôm hooked. I‚Äôm already starting to crave tomorrow‚Äôs class. Thankyou for this wonderful euphoric trance and newfound love for myself and my body.

Day 3: I did downward dog today, only for a second but I did it! I also held a plank for a second there as well, my hands are not hurting so bad when I‚Äôm on my hands and knees. Normally I‚Äôm in so much pain I have to check to see how long of class is left but I didn‚Äôt check today, in fact I was actually disappointed when class was over.

During the spring 2020 I practiced with you for more than 2 months - the first 30 days of yoga and the videos for beginners and foundations of yoga. But than I stopped and couldn't get myself to practice again. But this new program with your emails for every day... that's been the perfect motivation. And maaaaan, how much I am glad. üòä I felt it - everything. This practice was a stress relief for me and made me feel much calmer and positive. It helped me with my stomach and digestion, too (after all the junk - yet tasty - food I've eaten during the holidays ü§£). Today I truly felt a huge impact of being here and practicing on my mind and my body. And I also have a hope for this to be the push I've been needing this whole time to get better, happier and to do something with my life. Thanks again!

I did go to a power yoga class at my uni for multiple semesters and liked it, although it often felt rushed, was only weekly, and felt boring to do by myself at home. Adriene changed this for me. Doing YWA for about a month and a half gave me so much! It's such a personal learning experience and growth both physically and mentally! I can't even stress how big of a role this plays for me mentally nowadays! Also, the fact that there are so many of us doing this together, plus all the uplifting commentary makes it feel so much nicer and personal! Thanks, Adriene and thanks to everyone else here!

And my yoga postures are better than ever, because when you're not 'trying to', it flows by itself. Because we don't inter-fear with our bodies, they know what they're doing, when we let them and work with them, not 'on' them  :D 

Doing THIS to set the tone for the year is the BEST. My intention: I AM CLEAR ON WHY I'M HERE. Feel free to use it  :)  
2020 sure helped focus that, but this even more. It's already powerfully showing itself. Adriene, Benji, Chris, and all you lovelies from our global family, you rock!!

I found it hard to go this slow peaced. I can't tell why but I don't feel like getting into deep listening of my inner world these days. Maybe I feel more like doing something physical.
To listen to what I felt was good I had to make it faster.

I'll stick to the journey though. I'd like to know why I don't feel like deep connecting to myself sometimes. So I try to trust the process and see where it leads.

This is my third year in a row doing this challenge and not only am I blown away by how differently I am this year, mentally and physically, but also how deeply comforted I was by the thought of so many people around the world being with me at that moment. It's so easy to feel alone right now, even in a house full of people you love, especially when struggling with a mental illness that feels beyond me, but just the idea of having all of you with me for 30 days is truly magical.

I struggled to find a yoga channel with a series that was simple, yet challenging for a somewhat beginner.  Your 30 day yoga journey for last year really helped me stay engaged, mindful, and on track. I learned so much and felt much more at home in my body. When I returned to campus and took a Hatha Yoga course, I could feel the muscle memory from the journey, feeling in shape and in control.
