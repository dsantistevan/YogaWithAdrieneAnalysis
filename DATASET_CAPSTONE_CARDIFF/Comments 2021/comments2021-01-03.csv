80.0,"DAY 2 - 09/13/2021

Done with my Day 2 practice! A lot of things happened this weekend and I feel like I'm on the verge of running away from my thoughts. But then, I reminded myself that that's not how you deal with it and so I arrive to this practice breathing in and out while acknowledging those thoughts I put aside - both scary and kind. I finally decided that if I'm going to do this whole healing and self-love thing, I should stop running away from my thoughts and feelings, instead think of ""What would be a better version of myself do this time?"". Well, she will not invalidate her feelings instead she will name it and let it go. 

Today's, practice brought me to different light. Yoga is more than just an activity that I get to do every day, it is 'that' part of my day where my soul gets recognition and where I stop and breath because I am human too. Life will throw you into different storms but I make sure that whatever storm I'm in, I have to meet myself at some point of the day and listen to it and pause and breathe and feel. Because even though the world is crumbling before me, there is A HIGHER POWER who still got the world in His hands. All is well. 

So, if you happen to read this, just show up. Today, I showed up even though my brother keep on climbing behind me while I do planks or table top position haha. Show up. Just show up and meet yourself for a while. üå±‚ú®

Jalaluddin Rumi

Translated by Coleman Barks

This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they‚Äôre a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

It was so challenging keeping one leg up, and I certainly couldn't make my nose touch my knee.

And for a long time, life was good.

I am currently back to who I was before Yoga. Basically stressed, depressed, and constantly tired. I stopped doing Yoga a few months so I didn't think getting back into will be difficult. But oh boy, I started Day 1 yesterday and oh my god! Poses that used to feel so easy for me somehow became very very difficult. My legs were shaking and when I woke up today, my whole body is sore! I did not want to continue with this. But guess what, I am not gonna give up cause I will reach to that point in life where I can feel good again!

780.0,"I like this class a lot. I was there for day 1 too. I just have a critic I hope is useful.

The speaking is very monotonous, and it becomes stressful when you have to turn your head up to the screen every five seconds to check if you're doing it right, or if you have been holding the pose for too long. I have the feeling that I cant trust this voice that goes ""so you tuck your chin to your chest and bring your foot onto the mat AND BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO YOUR BREATH move this to that and roll up to the sky AND THEN THE IDEA OF THE ARRIVAL..."" : I mean, you cant just let the flow go and look for the inflection of the voice to follow the instructions, you have to be there for each word, studying what's possibly coming at the end of the sentence so you're not too late doing your move (and if you miss one word - maybe because a car passed or because you're not fluent in english - then you feel totally lost). And whenever the tone changes, it gets your attention, you get all excited about whats coming next, and you realize it wasnt new information, it was just telling you to relax, which has the opposite effect. ^^",Ugx1BvwzQHoQx0tkfoV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-19T10:44:09Z,-0.9748536944389343

Yesterday, I started doing this.  I had been wanting to, but I kept putting it off because I was making the excuse of ""Oh, it's so long.  I don't have time"" (but I was just sitting on the couch watching YouTube anyways).  However, I realized just how much tension I was holding in my jaw (I have TMJ and it's been worse lately) and so I sat down and did the video.
I woke up today, debating on if I wanted to get out of bed early and do this or if I wanted to sleep an extra hour and just do it in the evening.  I got up and did it.  I'm glad I decided to start my day this way.

The time will come
when, with elation
you will greet yourself arriving
at your own door, in your own mirror
and each will smile at the other's welcome,

and say, sit here. Eat.
You will love again the stranger who was your self.
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you

all your life, whom you ignored
for another, who knows you by heart.
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,

the photographs, the desperate notes,
peel your own image from the mirror.
Sit. Feast on your life.

Second day of journey

As usual, I don't understand the language, but the rhythm of Adriene's word is comforting.
I feel myself arriving new, my Mind quieting and regenerating.

The world is now confused and searching for a new and a beautiful path.
I believe we are connected to the peaceful energy

This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes As an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they‚Äôre a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.

1088.0,"I've never commented before, but I started practicing yoga by following your videos sometime last year. It helped me get through the worst moments of isolation and anxiety. I'm commenting today because this particular practice taught me something so new--the concept of arriving with each inhale. As I've continued through the other videos of this series so far, I keep coming back to that. Even when I'm not doing yoga--when I start to get stressed or check out I catch myself inhaling and thinking ""arrive"" and it's like... a reset button. I come back to myself. And in practice, I use it to bring myself back when my thoughts wander OR to help when I'm meeting my edge and don't think I can keep going. ""Arriving"" on that next inhale when my body is shaking is for me, again, a reset that lets me feel like I'm restarting the session even if I'm in the middle of it. SO yeah.

1138.0,I need this right now. My housemate is also my best friend - I've been in love with him for just under a year and told him about this recently only to be rejected. I can feel a shift happening in our dynamic as we adjust to this information and he allows me the space I need to handle this (we're in the middle of lockdown so can't leave the house and I also work with him) but I'm just terrified that this is the beginning of the end of our friendship. I'm a little heartbroken of course but the fear of losing the closeness we have is even worse. Having these practices helps ground me a little and access the emotions I'm struggling with at the moment.

And on the other hand, a new arrival at every inhale also means, that I don't need to stay, I can walk away at every exhale. And we agreed that showing up is the hardest part.

I waited until nearly one in the morning to finally do this thing, literally putting it off until the last second, but I refused to skip a day due to fear. I am SO GLAD I DID THIS. Honestly, yoga has been annoying me lately. Yoga, typical meditation, all that Jazz, just makes me super irritable. And honestly it‚Äôs been like that all of 2020 and tonight I finally realized that it‚Äôs okay to feel like that. Because I found the source for me is because I‚Äôve spent so long just sitting. Waiting. Breathing through it all- I‚Äôve wanted to ACT. Burn. In all areas of my life.

Recently I‚Äôve wanted to lose weight and reset my body so I turned to water fasting like I normally do. I got annoyed with that, so I‚Äôm eating healthy and doing Pilates and 2x yoga- and I feel great. I felt stuck at my job so after SO LONG I  got a new one and now I feel great there too. And so the annoyance I‚Äôve been getting with yoga and meditation is just because I want to DO more, and this video did that for me. 

A perfect balance of activating muscles üí™ and your brain üß† and ‚ù§Ô∏è. It made me feel like I was DOING something rather than just looking inward. I‚Äôve looked inward for so long that it started staring back at me telling me to do something else. I‚Äôm rambling now with no point so I‚Äôm going to go journal before bed. But YES, do this video.

1843.0,"For the first time in I don't know how many years, I did not sign up for a mileage based challenge.  I have spent years pushing my body trying to hit 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 miles per year.  Every year I do my best and every year I fail to reach the goal.  Throughout the years I've had to overcome pneumonia, knee issues, feet issues, ridiculously long work hours, a head injury, and this year, a torn calf.  The torn calf led me to the Home journey from last year.  Finally I felt peace when I exercised.  After thirty days, my knees, feet, and calf felt better.  The practice didn't aggravate my injured brain.  I didn't have to overcome anything.  I just felt good - not as stiff, stronger, and just better about myself.  So this year, I didn't sign up for any mileage based challenge.  I'm going to focus on yoga and walk three times a week.  I'm going to not push myself through pain.  Imagine that?  I'm going to see what happens when I honor and listen to my body rather than ignore everything it's trying to tell me.  Today was wonderful.  I am no yoga guru.  I still can't sweep my leg all the way through to a lunge but I can get to one and do one pretty darn well once I'm there!  Hahaha.  Each day I do my best and for once, I know that this is enough.  I am enjoying the journey.  Thank you Adrienne.  I am forever grateful for my torn calf because it led me to your page.  <3",Ugyx7J6YQ-kVym5bcjd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-04T02:14:55Z,0.9978864789009094

‚ÄúThis being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.
A joy, a depression, a meanness,
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor.
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they‚Äôre a crowd of sorrows,
Who violently sweep your house
Empty of its furniture,
Still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
For some new delight.
The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
Meet them at the door laughing,
And invite them in.
Be grateful for whoever comes,
Because each has been sent,
As a guide from beyond.‚Äù

I write this not from the point of view of being an expert, but because this is what I'm working on.",UgwcGldb4sbbCdJuqH54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-03T21:26:35Z,0.9986467957496643
2212.0,Thank you! I've been busy on a laptop and had a lot of pain in my upper back/shoulder. After this practice it's totally gone! I love when you say that each breath is a new invitation to arrive!,UgzlqXyxXqXiz6XxX_N4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-03T21:26:13Z,-0.9809300899505615
2213.0,"I‚Äôm 69 and was diagnosed with osteoporosis so I put my yoga on hold and began to do a lifting class, BodyPump, by Les Mills, at my club. I also started doing BodyFlow, another Les Mills class. It combines Tai Chi moves with yoga and core work. After 4 months I noticed I had developed tennis elbow. it was painful and I had to stop using it for a few weeks. I decided not to do any more BodyPump classes, and am replacing it with yoga once again. I will continue BodyFlow but NO MORE HEAVY LIFTING. It‚Äôs so sad when we work to get fitter only to injure ourselves. Yoga is so much gentler yet still challenges me. Adriene, your class has been a lifesaver during Covid. I know I speak for a lot of people when I say this. I see that you have become much calmer over the years and seem more mature. I wonder if you will decide to go on a sabbatical to India at some point, lol. I love your funny asides or when you sing a song related to what you‚Äôre doing or saying. As a musician I often think about doing the same thing but find myself holding back. Why? We should all be feeling free to sing whenever we feel it,  but most of us are too uptight, I guess. Anyway, thanks for being your wonderful free-spirited self and let‚Äôs keep doing this for a long long time!

This being human is a guest house.

Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,

Some momentary awareness comes

As an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!

Even if they‚Äôre a crowd of sorrows,
Who violently sweep your house
Empty of its furniture,
Still, treat each guest honorably.

He may be clearing you out
For some new delight.
The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
Meet them at the door laughing,
And invite them in.
Be grateful for whoever comes,
Because each has been sent,
As a guide from beyond.

2561.0,"Day 2 of practicing with hypermobility (possible and very likely hEDS- a connective tissue disorder which manifests in hypermobile joints (frequent dislocations) and skin, and other symptoms like heart palpitations, digestive issues, chronic pain and fatigue that can be more harm than good when it comes to exercise like yoga, which is often given as a recommendation if you experience chronic pain (as it was given to me when I was told I had fibromyalgia, as no one had noticed my hypermobility), as those with hypermobile joints can very easily overextend these joints or destabalise them, making them feel worse, rather than finding the practice useful and soothing, there's a confusion between flexibility and hypermobility, something I didn't understand for a long time and I'm still getting used to with my new awareness of my symptoms and my joints.))- I'm doing this as not only do I want something to help me bring awareness to my breath, but to my body, and how I can modify practices to make sure I don't cause my body more injury. Today I:
- cried at the very beginning with the 'arrival of breath' and welcoming it etc- yay for emotional release
- halfway through the practice I put my wrist braces on, as I was feeling a lot of pain and strain in them- they're the soft types, without a metal insert. these did help marginally but did hinder putting my whole hands on the ground, and didn't stop strain being put on my fingers as they're only support for the wrists)
- put a blanket under my knees at all times, whether I was in a tabletop position, or straightening my legs to make sure I wasn't overextending or putting stress on my knees. I also in the sitting down forward fold didn't keep my knees on the ground or blanket as I knew I can do that- but in doing so overextending my knees, so I bent them instead to keep them safe)
- tried to be mindful of where my hands were in relation to my shoulders (very difficult), and where my shoulders were in relation to my ribs and neck and ears (weird way to put it but basically- was my shoulder still where my shoulder should SAFELY be, not where it could go if I let it)
- tried to be mindful of always keeping the slightest of bends in the elbow, making sure my elbows didn't over extend 
- took frequent breaks, even if it meant I missed a move or two- I know yoga is useful for building strength, but I also kept in mind that pain doesn't always necessarily equal that building of strength, and could mean the move isn't a wise choice for my body
- I can't use my fingers to prop myself up as they're very hypermobile, so attempted to use my whole hand (keeping a slight bend in the elbow) or with my hand in a fist, on my knuckles
- managed the whole session with only one actual pause of the video- whereas yesterday I needed several
all of this was done at the expense of not keeping my thought on the breath at all times, because it's quite a task trying to keep track of everything, but I think I'll keep going with the wrist braces, and keep them in the braces before and after the session, and keep an eye on them, as well as my fingers, elbows and shoulders, which do hurt a bit more than I think they should, especially my fingers, to see if too much stress has been put on them already. If I find they're injured ice and rest shall be applied. I think I did much better than I did yesterday in terms of noticing things I could do to improve my experience, keep my body safe, even if it wasn't exactly how it was instructed, or took away from my awareness of breath, because at the end of the day, can't breathe if the body can't quite breathe with it y'know? I have no clue if anyone will read this or anyone with hypermobile joints specifically will and has any advice or finds this helpful but I was told for YEARS before I knew hEDS was a possibility and I was hypermobile that my chronic pain could basically be cured very magically by exercise- specifically yoga, by doctors and friends and physio and pretty much everyone, and it wasn't until someone noticed I was hypermobile I realised that I was doing myself a disservice because I was overextending everything while doing this exercise, leading to much more pain, and that my body was not compatible with yoga- but I'm attempting to find out if I can MAKE yoga compatible, if I can become aware of which of my joints do what, what symptoms flare during or after, how can I fix that etc.",UgxI4tPeOSDT_rBW56p4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-03T18:39:20Z,-0.8480716411189826

I have been struggling with body issues lately and to see people with such kind comments saying ""we're in this together!"" or like ""yoga isn't a competition. honor your body, mind, and soul"" made me shed a tear. Yoga may be seen as another source to strengthen the body but people forget that it also strengthens our mind, heart, and soul. To be honest, it is rare to find good yoga videos that help us relax, meditate, and be present. Most of the time it is for ""vigorous"" exercises or simply sequences to just do the poses, never attending to our minds and feelings. I know it's just  a matter of preference but I feel like people should also take the time to be mindful of our thoughts not just do chaturangas and whatnot. This is a biased comment but I do hope people rlly spare time to notice their feelings and thoughts than their physical actions. Im truly grateful for YWA and its community. They teach us to honor our feelings whilst doing yoga.

---- üåû---- 
Today's practice was an eye-opener. I realized what my problem really was: ""stuck and dwelling in the past"". Back in early 2020, I exercised daily, did yoga daily, ate healthy foods, drank plenty of water until more food and celebrations came in. I realized how ungrateful i was. I didn't see them as blessings. I saw them as objects that ""ruined"" me, things that would make me ""fat"" and ""unhealthy"" when in fact, it was just the feeling of guilt. I didn't want to admit that I enjoyed the delicious food. And then I stopped doing my daily habits, came the mental break downs and such. I hated myself. ""Why can't I be the way I was before? I was smaller and prettier"" I tried exercising again but the thoughts of failing just came back. I was so invested in the past and what my imaginable future could look like that I didn't realize where I truly was, the present moment. It made me so lost. so It was my resolution for the new year's to go back to my old ways. Little did I actually know, those old ways were self-destructive. I only wanted to go back to my old ways to look ""prettier"" This practice really reminded me that it is not to go back to old ways and to embrace the present moment and breathe in for a new start. NEW START. I was so deep in the past. An exit was not to be found. but this practice made me escape. Thank you Adriene for giving me a door to open and ARRIVE in my new beginnings.

3112.0,"It's absolutely true that showing up is the hardest part and for sure it's hard for me to find that motivation every single day. Here's a tip that I sometimes use to make myself commit to those 'hard' things like showing up for yoga or doing daily piano practice, for example. That is - just roll out your mat / sit down and decide to do 5 minutes. Literally just five minutes. Most likely you'll keep going and do the whole thing, but lets say it really isn't your day and everything is too hard - worst case you've done 5 minutes of breathing and neck rolls or 5 minutes of scales (or whatever). How bad is that? Of course it's not perfect but even 5 minutes is better than nothing at all. Hope that helps! x",UgzkqWjHBEfrky0-kL14AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2021-01-03T15:28:56Z,-0.9925130605697632

3286.0,"The Guest House by Rumi

This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they‚Äôre a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

3502.0,"Wow! I have been inspired by you to build my daily yoga practice now for the past five years ever since I believe what was your first 30 day challenge and today just blew me away even more than ever, which at this point I didn't think possible! For the past year I have been focused on building my soul biz, The Joyous Parent yes, in the middle of a pandemic and have had so much self doubt, uncertainty, shame for having ""abandoned"" my fellow educators in the classroom and moving around with a lot of proving energy and fear of failure. But today, when you said to simply celebrate a new beginning with each breath, I was finally and miraculously and simply able to just drop into the amazing miracle and overflowing gratitude of the wonder of what I get to do each day, even each moment. I got to the point by the end of this video that each breath was like ""wow, how amazing is my life!"" ""Wow, I'm so blessed"" ""wow, this moment is full of so much magic and glory too!"" - and I realized, what a gift, if I am able to approach my biz building like THAT, then imagine how much more impact my work and passion will be for others because I will just be in celebration mode of the every amazing, beautiful, imperfect, terrifying moment of putting myself out there and embracing what comes back... I feel able to take the lessons on the mat off of it and into real life on a whole new level. And who knows what will be?! Maybe I just get to be me in this moment, and now in this moment again, and in every moment I say thank you thank you thank you for the gift of this new breath and hello to what might be and become!

THE GUEST HOUSE 

This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.
A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice.
meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.
Be grateful for whatever comes.
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!

who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honourably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

3989.0,"2020 has been my year of hell. After more than 7 years of struggling in my studies and work, I decided to listen to my body and STOP. What followed was of course a breakdown of my body and I was diagnosed with severe, pent up, burnout. I have lain in bed for weeks. Then the pandemic happened. During those weeks in bed thinking, a lot of unresolved childhood trauma caused by skipping grades in school came up. Then, last december, in the space of just 10 days, my grandma died, my dog died and my father, not yet 60 years old, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I spent NYE sobbing my heart out. What was supposed to be my year of healing dug my even more into the mud. 

My former strong and fit body has been reduced to a quivering mess with VERY tight muscles and more than once I had to stop today because it was too hard or because relaxing caused me to sob again. But I am determined to make it through, however many breaks and modifications it might take. Showing up, every day, to do something for myself in these mountains of grief. Healing in 2021 is my goal.
