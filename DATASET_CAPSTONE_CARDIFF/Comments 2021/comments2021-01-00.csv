10.0,"Hey there! This is the 1st time I am writing anything, but I have wanted to so many times! I have been watching these at-home yoga videos religiously since August of 2012 (minus some time off during pregnancy lol), and man...I tell everyone I know about Yoga with Adriene.  When I noticed that you were on the news, I flipped. The fact that I can keep getting into your videos regularly, having to make time for it when kids are running around and so many things need attention, that is really something for me.  You had me at, ""Get hot for your inner teacher..."" amongst many other things- you have been like a ray of light and a breath of fresh air, all wrapped into a super-cool, relatable, person- and not to mention my entire BODY is just insane (well in my opinion for my age and having 4 children...I mean my core is strongggg) Anywhooo, I just have so much admiration and respect for the person you are and how you are able to do this- it is how you are able to really speak to me and how I keep coming back to the mat each day (the hardest part). I am sure you hear this stuff all the time, and honestly I have been wanting to comment on the actual videos for so long, but this was the first time I have used my laptop to get to Yoga with Adriene??? Furthermore, I LOVE BREATH! I already went through it once, but now I am on Day 14 for the 2nd go round.  This is really long, my bad.  Hope you see this one day.....

Looking forward to it..

We were both so engaged by her teaching style and so enriched by the first experience that we cycled through every 3o day journey she has made. Every single one has been a gift and deepened our practice and sense of self connection profoundly. I had practiced yoga on and off over the years but never had a home practice let alone a daily practice. We haven't missed a day on in the mat in 2020 (okay maybe a day here or there but very few). We are not spring chickens (50 plus) and this is the strongest I've felt in years. It has changed our life and changed our bodies (but that's almost the secondary benefit relative to the mental health benefits.) We are so deeply grateful for YWA and amazed by this community.

 I always enjoy your 30 day yoga challenge. So grateful to see this new one to kick start 2021 and a focus on the breath too, from one yoga student/ teacher from my heart to yours.. I honour the love and light that resides in you Adriene... I'm truly learning that the real essence of yoga is within the yama's and niyama's & simply being present. Yoga is not about the asanas... and you are a beautiful soul whom I am so grateful for... What a beautiful theme for a 30 day challenge. I look forward to joining you and connecting with the most reliable rhythm in our lives ( Donna Farhi ).. The breath...

445.0,"4 Het werd vernietigd, de aarde viel; werd ziek, de wereld viel; de hoge volkeren van de aarde werden ziek. 5 En het land werd verontreinigd onder zijn inwoners; omdat ze de wetten overtreden, ze de wet verdraaiden, ze het eeuwige verbond schonden. 6 Om deze reden verteerde de vloek het land en werden de inwoners verwoest; om deze reden werden de bewoners van de aarde verteerd en werden de mensen kleiner.
7 De wijn is verloren, de wijnstok is ziek, alle vrolijkheid van hart kreunde.
8 De blijdschap van de tamboerijnen is opgehouden, het geluid van degenen die zich verheugden, de vreugde van de harp is opgehouden.
9 Onder gezang zullen zij geen wijn drinken; cider zal bitter zijn voor degenen die het drinken.
10 De stad wordt verbroken door ijdelheid; elk huis is gesloten, zodat niemand naar binnen kan.
11 Er wordt geroepen vanwege gebrek aan wijn op straat; alle vreugde was verduisterd, vreugde werd van de aarde verbannen.
12 De stad was woest en de poort werd verwoest.
13 Want zo zal het zijn in het midden van de aarde, te midden van de volken, als een geschudde olijfboom, als nalezingen na de oogst.
Jesaja 24: 4-13.
-
6 En u zult horen van oorlogen en geruchten van oorlogen; zorg ervoor dat je niet gestoord wordt, want het is noodzakelijk dat dit allemaal gebeurt; maar het einde is nog niet. 7 Want volk zal opstaan ‚Äã‚Äãtegen volk, en koninkrijk tegen koninkrijk; en er zullen plagen en hongersnoden en aardbevingen zijn op verschillende plaatsen.8 En dit alles zal het begin van pijn zijn. Matte√ºs 24: 6-8 JEZUS.
-
26 ‚ÄúNet zoals het gebeurde in de tijd van Noach, zo zal het zijn wanneer de Zoon des mensen komt. 27 Ze aten, dronken en trouwden en huwden tot de dag dat Noach de ark binnenging; toen kwam de vloed en vernietigde ze allemaal.
28 Hetzelfde gebeurde in de tijd van Lot: ze aten en dronken, kochten en verkochten, zaaiden en bouwden. 29 Maar op de dag dat Lot '' '' (Sodom) '' '' verliet, regende het vuur en zwavel uit de hemel en vernietigde ze allemaal.
30 ‚ÄúZo zal het zijn op de dag dat de Zoon des mensen wordt geopenbaard. Lukas 17: 26-30 JEZUS
-
9 En wanneer u hoort van oorlogen en opruiingen (protesten tegen hun heersers), schrik dan niet; omdat het nodig is dat deze dingen eerst gebeuren; maar het einde zal niet onmiddellijk zijn. 10 Toen zeide hij tot hen: Natie zal tegen volk opstaan, en koninkrijk tegen koninkrijk; 11 en er zullen grote aardbevingen zijn, en op verschillende plaatsen hongersnoden en pestilenties; en er zullen verschrikking en grote tekenen uit de hemel komen.
Lukas 21: 7-11
-
12 en omdat het kwaad is toegenomen, zal de liefde van velen verkouden.
13 Maar wie volhardt tot het einde, zal worden gered. 14 En dit evangelie van het koninkrijk zal in de hele wereld worden gepredikt als een getuigenis voor alle nati√´n; En dan komt het einde. Matte√ºs 24: 12-14
-
22 En als die dagen niet werden bekort, zou niemand worden gered; maar vanwege de uitverkorenen zullen die dagen worden ingekort. Matte√ºs 24:22 JEZUS
-
8 Maar God toont zijn liefde voor ons, in de tijd dat we nog zondaars waren, Christus JEZUS stierf voor ons.
9 Omdat wij reeds gerechtvaardigd zijn in zijn bloed, zullen wij door hem van toorn worden verlost.
10 Want indien wij, als vijanden, met God verzoend zijn door de dood van zijn Zoon, en nog meer, als wij verzoend zijn, zullen wij gered worden door zijn leven. Romeinen 5: 8-10

16 ‚ÄúOmdat God zoveel van de wereld hield dat hij zijn eniggeboren Zoon (JEZUS) heeft gegeven, zodat een ieder die in hem gelooft niet verloren gaat, maar eeuwig leven heeft. Johannes 3:16
-
18 Kom vlug, zegt de Heer, en laten we op onze hoede zijn: als uw zonden als scharlaken zijn, zullen ze wit zijn als sneeuw; als ze rood zijn als karmozijnrood, zullen ze als witte wol zijn. Jesaja 1:18
-
9 dat als u met uw mond belijdt dat Jezus de Heer is, en met uw hart gelooft dat God hem uit de dood heeft opgewekt, u gered zult worden.
10 Want met het hart wordt geloofd tot gerechtigheid, maar met de mond wordt beleden tot redding.
 Romeinen 10: 9-10
--23 Want het loon van de zonde is de dood, maar de gave van God is het eeuwige leven in Christus Jezus, onze Heer. Romeinen 6:23
-
12 En in geen ander is er redding; want er is geen andere naam onder de hemel, aan de mensen gegeven, waardoor we kunnen worden gered. Handelingen 4: 11-12
-
10 zodat in de naam van Jezus elke knie zou buigen, van hen die in de hemel en op aarde en onder de aarde zijn;
11 en elke tong belijdt dat Jezus Christus de Heer is, tot eer van God de Vader. Filippenzen 2: 10-11
-
12 Maar aan allen die hem ontvingen, aan hen die in zijn naam geloofden, gaf hij het recht kinderen van God te worden; Johannes 1:12
-
23 Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Wie mij liefheeft, zal mijn woord bewaren; en mijn Vader zal hem liefhebben, en wij zullen tot hem komen en bij hem wonen. Johannes 14:23
-
23 Maar het uur komt, en is nu, dat ware aanbidders de Vader zullen aanbidden in geest en in waarheid; omdat de Vader ook zulke aanbidders zoekt om hem te aanbidden.
24 God is Geest; en degenen die hem aanbidden, in geest en in waarheid is het noodzakelijk dat ze aanbidden.
Johannes 4: 23-24
27 Vrede laat ik met u, mijn vrede geef ik u; Ik geef het je niet zoals de wereld het geeft. Laat uw hart niet verontrust zijn, en laat het ook niet bang zijn. Johannes 14:27

I'm basically working backwards, having started with Home & then the other 30 day challenges every other month, filling in the interim months with Adriene's other individual practices.  I've done other routines via DVDs for decades but they're gathering dust now, as I'm a daily YWA yogi now!  Am looking forward to starting 2021 (it's got to be better than 2020, right?!) with Breath, especially since I've only particpated once in a live International Yoga Day this year.  THANKS Adriene for your huge contibution to the wellness of my body & mind this year & presumably for the rest of my retired life!
