The only thing I practised was yoga nidra (my corporation sponsored it as a part of stress management sessions) which I surprisingly loved and after a couple of lessons I realized I want to do something more. A friend recommended your channel and that’s the best thing that happened to me this year – it was only a few days and I’m already feeling better, more aware of my body, more calm and energetic at the same time.

138.0,im now on my fifth circuit of this programme. You definitely need to do it more than once in order to get most benefit from it if you are a beginner. My first lap of Breath was a learning experience and my second time through I think I understood more of what I was supposed to be doing. This helps because there is less need to look at Adriene and more time to think about what is going on and concentrate on what she is saying.  In doing this practice every day I am developing a daily routine have incorporated Adriene into it. I certainly miss it if I cant do it for whatever reason ( i think i have missed four days) ....

I took some time off to find my balance again and thought yoga would help. But during the yoga sessions, I feel a lot of anxiety, panic and sadness. I also feel like I am short of breath and ready to faint. Like my body does NOT want to do this. Is that normal? Is it good to push through and just go on? Or is it a sign of my body that it is too much? It typically happens during the strength-building parts. Again, I really hope someone can give me some advice.

I already love the slow, but powerful, flow of the sessions. A practical thing: How do you people avoid sliding on the mat in downward facing dog? I tried naked feet and then socks, but I feel I need to apply extra force just to remain in the pose. Any tricks out there for the best way?
I am in Denmark by the way.

It took awhile to not judge myself when it was time for hip replacement and at first viewed the changes as ""I used to do pigeon"" or other poses as a failure on my part. I now teach adaptive accessible yoga with Lakshmi Voelker Chair Yoga and help other yogis and those who find getting up and down on the mat challenging.

477.0,"I guess this isn't for everyone.  I ""sort of"" got through the ""30 days with Adriene"" and thought I would then try this Breath 30 days, but surprisingly it is for me way too hard and frustrating.  Too difficult to hear and understand her and when I do look up she is 3 poses ahead.  I really suck at the poses also, and although I know I only need to do what I can, when one is so far off, it tends to be too frustrating to keep trying something that is way too difficult.  I'm going to give up on this Breath voyage and maybe try some of her other videos for runners or climbers or left-handed chess players or whatever, or maybe try the original 30 days again and see if I can find something that isn't just exhausting and straining and frustrating  I've never been flexible so this isn't much of a surprise, but I hoped it would help with range of motion.  Maybe it has a little, but too little to really tell after just some 5-6 weeks or so.  Anyway, hopefully i am the rare duck that doesn't fit in here and everyone else is doing great and really happy and energized.  It sounds like it from the other responses.

Day  Five of the journey

After looking up the meaning of ""Replenish"", I practiced.

I had been thinking only about Replenishing from the outside, 
but I learned that I could also Replenish from within inside.

I am fulfilled. (The movement was hard, but…）


I wish you all a wonderful  day.

611.0,Omg it’s amazing how quickly your body can regress into a pile of mush. Only 6 months since I kicked my regular workout habit and I had zero core or arm strength to support my planks or downward dogs. I almost cried I was so frustrated with how I kept breaking. But I breathed and got back into position and finished. Hoping by the end of the 30 days I’ll have some strength back and drive to get back into a regular workout routine.,UgxmeU3U6XpX6oBqtjN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-15T12:55:03Z,-0.8154481649398804

624.0,"I’ve been forced to stop working or being active at all due to a fever of unknown origin during this pandemic.  After months of barely being able to stand long enough to do dishes, I’m finally trying to work on my stamina and begin to cope with fatigue.  I used to be one of the most active people I knew, and this whole thing has been a huge hit to that part of my identity.  Though I can’t do these videos every day because of the fever and fatigue, the gentle way she invites you back makes it feel like it’s okay.  In a way, her commentary makes it okay to be forgiving of myself and the new limitations my body has.  That I’m listening to what my body can handle, and that is the best I can do right now for it.  That kind of forgiveness is invaluable in allowing me to cope with these strange new limitations, and I’m sure it’s like that for everyone, regardless of your situation.",Ugwwb2ONHXxDxWBAtZd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-14T20:28:57Z,0.9989866614341736

One thing that I noticed during today's practice, is that despite taking only what I could do (I only held the smaller downward dog at the end I couldn't do the twists) and achieving what I decided to do, I started crying because of something that I couldn't do; and I think that is something that relates to overly high expectations of myself. I expect myself to do all of these crazy cool things and strong feats when in reality, I just need to do what I can and that is more than enough-- there's no shame in any of that and there should never be any shame.

891.0,"When you feel like you're not good enough or you're not seeing the results you want, please read this. This is my 3rd time in the last 3 months starting a YWA 30 day practice -- and I cannot stress how much more meaningful these practices get as time goes on. I was thinking during my practice today about how much yoga meant to me when I first started dabbling at the end of 2019 -- how it opened me up spiritually and made me feel alive in a way ive never felt in my brief 19 years on this planet. It took a while for me to get to the point of daily practices and then to 30 day consistent practices -- and thats when it started getting tough and lose its shine, but I knew it was good for me, a spiritual vegetable id avoided for a long time, so I stuck with it. The 2nd go round was easier in the sense my muscles were more toned, but it was harder to feel connected in that beautiful and fulfilling way like I first felt, and a lot of the time i felt like my mind was against me. And when this 3rd cycle first started, I wondered if this was all there is, the luster of a new activity finally good and dull. 

But no. I was so wrong. I can feel that connection coming back. I can feel the hard work paying off as my mind begins to bend and strengthen in the most loving and sustainable way. As I was in the squat twisted to the right, I felt my legs on fire, and where before I would've wanted to straighten and relieve myself, this time I thought to myself and to all of you practicing -- ""I know it hurts, but youre right there, you are getting stronger, you are not alone, keep holding on, dont give up!"" And I had the most genuine smile on my face as we all released and sank into a forward fold. 

There were times in the last 2 cycles of 30 day practices id feel so drained and unmotivated, I wouldn't do yoga that day or maybe several days, and I let myself do it. Perfectionistic guilt would try to eat at me, but I felt it didn't matter when I got back on the mat, it just mattered that I came back because I wanted to, and not because I was obligated. And I knew that if I came replenished and ready on my time, I'd enjoy it more, and I did. 

So I encourage you: let yourself have a day or more if you feel you really need it. There is no shame in saying, not today. Youre listening to your body and aligning with a compassionate understanding. You will come back, and you will be happier you did it. And over time, you may find that you need less and less breaks from yoga, but don't force it. Give yourself the gift of time. You will get there.",Ugy5hKYWkgvu3mdrMbh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-08T01:47:29Z,0.2465034389166672

918.0,"Catching up as I had a manic start to the year. So far loving it, but had two stumbling blocks in this one - first I really didn't even get close to folding my arms like that, I can barely grab my thumbs with the other hand coming around the elbow. And second when we got into the Vinyasa I had a really hard time sticking to the breathing as Adriene was dicating it, it was too slow for me and I badly needed oxygen so had to take a bunch of extra breaths. Are both of those things just completely ok, or is there something I'm missing?

P.s. I'm not at all a beginner, I've never gotten into the habit of regular yoga practice for more than a couple of months but I've done it on and off for about a decade.

Today, more than ever so far, the acquired knowledge and skills from practicing yoga and mediation were intentionally applied to help me through the dark events in the nation and the hurt, fear, and infirmity of those I encountered in the ER.  
Are we, as a nation, going to heal after today? Are we going to connect? I feel a deep sadness for us. 
Practicing Replinish before facing the day was the best part of my day which prepared me to face what was not expected or imaginable.  Refilled, restored, reloaded to face an unexpectedly hard day with deeper breath that gives rise to balance, strength, and a calmed mind. 
It is difficult today to find the mundane gifts, to find what to be thankful for yet if I look carefully there is much to thank for today in the midst of this trauma.

1794.0,"Day 5: okay, so today sucked and I said some VERY rude things to Adriene and also myself in the privacy of my home, which is unfair and I'm very glad she didn't hear them.  Sometimes yoga goes like that.

I have the most trouble, I think, when I don't understand what sort of position I'm supposed to be moving into.  There was a lot of pausing the video and clicking back, sometimes multiple times, to figure out what was going on.  There was a lot of not feeling like I had time to listen to my breathing and my body because I had to worry about trying to understand what I was meant to do next.  There was a lot of feeling out of sync, and getting way more out of sync as I tried to catch up.

Which begs the question: why is it so important to me to catch up?  Why is it so important that I do every single step and every single pose of every single practice, so much so that I get mad at myself and my very kind yoga instructor if I ever miss a beat?  If I hate pausing and clicking back and getting out of the flow to stop and figure things out and then having to start up again, then what's wrong with just keeping going and getting back into it a few beats later?

It's yoga.  Doing some of it is better than doing none of it.  There is no grand high Yoga Council watching me try to pass a Yoga Test that says I must complete every single element.  And yet I still feel like, if I don't get all of today's practice RIGHT, or at least mostly right, then I won't improve enough for the future and then I won't be able to do tomorrow's practice, or next week's, or next month's.

Today we are noticing feelings, and those are the feelings I'm noticing.  They exist.  I'm writing them down.  Tomorrow we will notice different feelings, and maybe they'll be better or maybe they'll be worse, but they're feelings.  And it's good to have a name for them.

And they're a little better now.",Ugy8DiQlHMyI8OCrGw54AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2021-01-06T18:39:23Z,-0.9982935786247253

2365.0,"I've been  wrestling with a crazy  muscle pudding in the back for the last like 6 months, that's been causing me lots of pain/troubles. I'm seeing physios, massos etc. It improves, but slowly.

Yoga has probably helped too - not that it's a cure-all (I had so much tension that I really do think I needed some specialized help to get ride of it). However it's a great tool to help me monitor the improvements and how things evolve. Especially with all the reminder to be very conscious of our posture, of how we place our feet/hands/legs/etc. I feel like my perception of the thousands of little peculiarities of my bodies is much better. I am confident this will help me avoid a rerun of that episode, and not get into huge imbalances like that  in the first place.",Ugw__uV9yNkhrfYHaFZ4AaABAg,1.0,2.0,2021-01-06T12:48:31Z,0.9753358364105225

2500.0,"Not sure whether my room was warmed up or the today's practice was harder, but I was actually sweating. :D
And I must say, so far, this journey feels soo right for me - my body and mind... The flow and everything.... Haven't felt like this before. 
I can't compere it to much of an anything - I've only finished the first 30 Days of Yoga, practiced witch some videos for beginners and Foundations of Yoga. And there is so many possibilities why this feels so great. 
Maybe everything would feel like it at this moment for me being the way I am now - both physically and mentally. Maybe the difference makes the fact, that I've been on this journey since the beginning with the rest of the world, waiting every day for the new video and email (and not practice it later on compare to and as I did with the first 30DoY and I'm gonna with the rest of them). Maybe all the 30DoY programs are that great (I'll see when I get to them after this one). Maybe BREATH is truly that awesome! <3 Or maybe it's all of these together. 
I dunno but still, it's amazing and I am so grateful in general and to YOU - Adriene! <3 In the core of all of your practices, it's your attitude, your calm voice, your knowledge, guidance and structure, which makes in general all of the videos amazing to begin with. :)

2693.0,"Today I got so excited not about doing yoga but actually reading the comments here after yoga that I felt a little bit impatient and hence unfocused haha. But mostly in a good way, just excited! I've been practicing with Adriene since 2017 and it's my 4th yoga challenge live in January but it's the first time I'm reading and responding to comments (and writing my own) - all of you guys bring so much positive energy to my day, it's crazy! 
Today I was a little bit sore from the last practices (I haven't have a rest day since 26th of December) but I surprised myself with doing chaturanga (in polish it's called ""pozycja kija"" which literally means ""the stick pose"", I think it's quite accurate!) without cheating and actually bending my arms! I have so weak arms that this pose it's always killing me and often I can't do it but today I did. My little victory <3
It's 9:30 AM in Poland and I came here straight after waking up (got a restful sleep eventually, yey!) and now feel super energized for the day ahead! THANK YOU!

2708.0,"Aww loved this, thanks Adrienne! As just woke up, I had to stretch a lil extra to match your pace. Also, to anyone that is heavier than average, don’t feel bad if it’s hard on your wrists. Adapt the moves to seated or stood. You are holding up a lot more that our slim yogi here. I no way could lift one hand in down dog, as can only just do it with two hands! Don’t let it put you off, plenty still to be gained from yoga and this breath journey. Similar if you have a larger chest, you physically won’t get your arms round as far, as two bossoms in the way! Or laying on front might be uncomfortable cos can’t get head to floor. Don’t worry about the poses, keep the breath and intention, and modify. It’s your body & practice.
