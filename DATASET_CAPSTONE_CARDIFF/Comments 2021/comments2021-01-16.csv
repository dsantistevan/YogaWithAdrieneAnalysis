He wanted to lick himself down there and keep up his hygene, which is a perfectly normal dog thing to do, but then he wasn't allowed. He kept licking the air after to cope with that. when animals start licking themselves their saliva production goes up. Later he attempted to lick himself again and Adriene told him off again so he wanted to leave. Again very reasonable, he wants to clean himself in peace but Adriene got a bad conscience and called him onto the mat.",Ugxzs8ptsj_XshfvjJ54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-11-12T15:37:42Z,-0.8711584806442261

Two days ago I tested positive for Covid after coming down with an illness.

It's easier for me to sit with my back straight, because I'm an artist and I spend hours hunched over the table, painting or drawing, and this is helping me a lot with that. Now I'm more cheerful than before. Today I found myself dancing and singing alone in the kitchen while doing the dishes, smiling and feeling so energetic! I love this feeling.

IMPORTANT I was following the practice from my computer and an 2 advertisements interrupted half way through. I thought you should know, and I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this.

159.0,"Adriene, I cannot thank you enough for providing such an accessible life-changing  practice and teaching in such a special informative way that makes everyone feel comfortable, coming back, and wanting to feel and do good. I wouldn't have been able to afford  a consistent yoga class, and imagining my life without yoga is heartbreaking. Everyone should know about yoga and anyone who wants to try yoga should have that opportunity. It should be part of the K-12 curriculum, in my opinion. When I worked at a public library, most patrons didn't know what yoga was. That's when I got the idea to start a public library program that would show your 30 Day Yoga Journey classes, so those without computers or internet or a safe place could practice. Sadly, that idea never came to fruition. But it's never too late! Thank you for existing!",UgzqdHjmT3JJCjWYGi54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-02-23T16:17:29Z,0.9753182530403137

259.0,"Hey there! I was wondering if I could provide a little constructive criticism as we practice today? 
You do an amazing job of encouraging love for the body and for the soul, but sometimes during certain poses, someone like myself is unable to do a certain move due to extra fat/weight on the body. For example, when bringing the leg in a hands length from the sit bone .. some people might be unable to do so. Perhaps encouraging your students to bring their leg as close as they can with a little room, might be a better way to phrase it? I try to give myself grace and do the best I can, but sometimes that little voice of you're not good enough creeps in.
I think what you do is amazing! I'm in no way trying to hinder your work. Simply a thought I've had over the last few videos.I hope this comes across with love and support! Thank you for what you do.",UgzIS8LsciH9TFGEH4B4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-28T03:24:52Z,0.995595395565033

381.0,"Thank you, Adrienne.  I have been using your program since lockdown. Your message is simple but profound at this time. Also, want to mention a little tip for anyone who struggles with consistency: I usually preview the video before getting on the mat. On some days, when I like a particular one, I would repeat the following day instead of going on to the next video. In addition, on those days when I'm repeating , I would mute the video, play from my laptop and find a piece of music that would be suitable to listen to and play through my earbuds.  Feels so good!! I'm dancing and floating - such bliss!! Thank you again!!",UgxbWgpdLmhpoDhy8e94AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-19T11:38:53Z,0.9997777342796326

395.0,"So today, in keeping with my new year's buzzword ""growth,"" I did something new and scary and went sky-diving for the first time! Within the first 10-20 seconds of free fall from 13,000 ft, I had the most intense sense of panic surrounding the fact that I couldn't easily breathe while hurtling through the air. So I looked inward and channeled this 30-day journey's focus and made myself breathe, and I relaxed, and then I was soaring, fully entering the wildest experience of my life.

Coming to the mat tonight, I found extra connection in this practice even though I'm a couple days behind: knocking on Heaven's door right away, which I felt I literally did today when I jumped out of an airplane - and then the suggestion of airplane arms in forward fold made me smile and know that today I did exactly what I was meant to do.

When I started doing your daily sessions in our living room, I got the attention of my 14 yr old son and my husband.  I went out and bought them yoga mats and they look forward to doing your yoga journeys with me every day.  I am so happy that I found out about your YouTube channel and got started.  I am seeing a real improvement in my flexibility and balance.  Thank you so much for offering this!",Ugxch70vNzJw7oI9-CF4AaABAg,1.0,2.0,2021-01-17T19:56:00Z,0.9985002279281616

I feel and notice the little changes, and am finding that connecting more consciously with the breath brings a kind of radical honesty about where I am in the world now.

But I showed up even when I really didn't want to. And it doesn't matter if I didn't do every pose. Or if my heart was only half in the practice. Because tomorrow is a new day to arrive. And maybe it's just as important that I show up on the ""bad"" days as it is that I show up when it's easy to do so.

At the end of the sesion I re-joined to that yummy floor twists and after all I felt amazing for adapting to what my body demanded today🙏🏻 Reminder that every practice is different and that listening to your body is the most important thing, much more than ""completing"" all the secuences no mather what.

Local Christmas trees have been freshly wood chipped and lovingly spread all over their incredibly beautiful park. I set up under a fairy tale tree (secretly glad that there were no children yet - it's the perfect spot for climbing and exploring). As I sat down, I observed two cats, with different owners, walking into the area on leashes. They met. Their humans met. They encountered a dog. I laughed with the humans and said it's like out of A Nightmare Before Christmas: the dog has entered ""cat park town"".

838.0,"Today was strange. This morning when I woke up I was journaling and I mentioned how grateful I am to have come back to yoga. I was doing it consistently from April 2020-June2020 and then I stopped and I don't really know why. I asked myself this in my journal. ""Why did I stop doing yoga?"" I concluded in my journal that it doesn't matter, I can't change what I didn't do, I can only change what I'm about to do. And I showed up on the mat. 

On the mat I figured out why I stopped. 

During today's practice, I missed going into warrior II on my left side. I kind of got off the tracks and went ahead of Adriene and realized what I forgot when I was in cobra. I just started feeling terrible. I don't think in words, like I don't have a narrative going on in my head, my thoughts visual and I feel them deeply. So I felt just pure negativity. I anchored my breath and worked through that and synched up with Adriene. 

Then I got to the floor and did the twist and because I have a bigger chest and a stomach, I don't have a lot of room and although i can bring my leg up, I don't feel good. Its not solely about comfort, but just not looking like what Adriene is doing. My thoughts came back and negativity came to sore again. Twice in a session. 

And this is why I stopped doing yoga in 2020. These intrusive thoughts about not following or not looking like what is being shown in the video. I stopped because after three months of yoga in 2020 I still was meeting these intrusive thoughts. They weren't going away. 

I learned something today on the mat: My thoughts are not me, but they will be constant visitors. What I can do is control my actions, my choices. It's then up to my thoughts to leave or stay. 

What a gift I found today. I truly entered into something that is going help me throughout my life.",UgxZJh52IYLsouMb5sd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-16T19:44:06Z,0.8048883080482483

Today's practice 16 was good, complete but speedy in some chain movements, at least for me. After yoga I have good energy for my day and my family. I find that it gives strength to my body and resilience to my mind and heart.

Hell no, I still don’t like it. But I accept it for what it is, I accept the fact I don’t like it and might not ever. This is a metaphor for my life. There will be people and things I don’t like-including myself-sometimes. But I accept it-and myself-for what it is.

Reflecting on the changes I have noticed in myself after these couple of weeks:
a. My posture has improved. I sit up straighter at work, on the mat, at the dining table.. Makes me feel taller and more confident.
b. I am more patient while dealing with my toddler. (Still a long way to go; he's in THAT phase.)
c. My body feels more flexible, especially the hip flexors.
d. I catch myself getting overwhelmed at times. Then, i stop and actively do a few counts of Ujjayi breath. It makes me feel calmer and more centered.
e. On the whole, my mood seems more lifted, in spite of the daily ups and downs.
This is my first 30 day yoga journey with Adriene and I am doing my best to stick to it everyday. Loving it so far! Thank you for this wonderful practice Adriene ❤️
My fellow Yogis, I invite you to check in with yourself and reflect on the changes that you have noticed so far in yourself at this halfway mark.
