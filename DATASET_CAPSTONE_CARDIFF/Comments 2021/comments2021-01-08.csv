0.0,"Lift your heart, relax your shoulders and let‚Äôs celebrate one week together.

This program has depth. It asks you to sustain curiosity and extend a kindness to yourself that maybe you are not used to.  It asks you to show up, even when you don‚Äôt feel like it, or when it feels like the day is conspiring against you.

You should feel proud! One week of showing up for yourself in this manner is no small feat.

Let's keep going.",UgwmLz2li8z9HQ8iS5J4AaABAg,82.0,1547.0,2021-01-08T13:45:57Z,0.999679684638977

26.0,"Before this, I had taken a while off. I was ill and spent around 5 days recovering. I took 6 days off overall. Even so, this actually was pretty easy, even though I spent a week ill without exercising at all. The plank positions aren't that bad, and I don't collapse when lowering myself down with the push up anymore. I'd say my flexibility is a little better than it used to be.

To review the week, I'd say that the biggest two things have been that I've become better at breathing, and I've stopped collapsing. Even when I'm not doing the yoga practice I'm mindful of my posture and even when I'm standing up or walking I'm looking to not collapse. I think that that's actually strengthened all the little muscles quite a bit, and my body feels quite a bit less heavy. My lower back's doing very well, which is a rarity since it is pretty terrible. I think that the yoga hits the core as well as the glutes pretty well every day. The flexibility feels slightly improved, although my flexibility has always been absolutely dreadful. Still, the lower back actually feels pretty decent and I'm looking forward to being able to bend forward slightly further eventually. 

I'm going to be beginning resistance training at the gym next week, for the first time since pandemic. I think that yoga will go great with it.",UgxVHgybbTHMbJYaKdB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-11-09T10:31:01Z,0.996654748916626

75.0,"Day 7 : Done with ease, more or less. The warrior was a little difficult today as I tried to make my lunge better. Question: When we are in a plank and step up our foot to go into a low lunge, does the foot come at level with the hand? Mine usually doesn't, I have to adjust a bit to make it so. If I try to level it so high, my front knee does not remain on top of my ankle. But I see all these people do it so well. Does anyone else experience something like this too?

By the way, I was (again) a day late. So it must have been 10+ days to complete this one week for me. But I do not scold myself, do not convert this into hate. Why is this so? I don't know, maybe it is this calming practice or maybe my will/heart/mind is just tired of being so tough on itself.

I try to do as much as I can but I can‚Äôt do a lot . I want to stretch my back doing cat/cow but that specific stretch messes up my disk and it creates pain down my leg and my sciatica area.

Day  7 of the journey

I feel calm and refreshed.

Even though I couldn't hear the words, 
even though Adriene was moving on to the next pose and my own movements were lagging, 
I was able to prioritize synchronizing with my own breath today.

In on pose,I felt like was painting a gentle sun.

506.0,"""Our quest for the Breath"" ‚ù§ Awsome in so many ways, both symbolic and physical. I¬¥m sure that you have a masterplan (as always) and I just want to agnolish the perfect timing of the BREATH theme THIS year (the sad and crazy time of the virus).  I  had the awful Covid virus a month ago and was very ill. The way back is long but I can feel how my lungs are recovering. Doing yoga with full focus on the BREATH is LOVELY right now. Being ill and away from the mat for a couple of weeks offcourse also shows on your strengh and flexibility so this programe is PERFECT for me right now. Back to basic, building the body, but foremost the mind. The acceptance, the positivity, the letting go and overall the love. ""Life is good"". THANK YOU so much. ‚ù§

509.0,"Aloha Adriene, i was wondering when is the best time of day to do your routine? I ªve been starting my day at 6am with your daily dose. I love it. Following yoga I do some calistethics like jumping jacks planks situps high knees and or pushups. Following that I do 4-6 laps walk down 3 and light jog up 3 my steep hill. Following that I do 15min on my Simply Fit Board. I do this daily M-F and take a rest day on Sat & Sun. 
Is this a good routine to start with Yoga and prep the body for further ex. I don ªt know what yoga protocol is. I love the breathing the breath and opening up. You have any suggestions.

718.0,"Hi fellow day-behind friends! As an ""experienced beginner"" (i.e. I've been doing yoga regularly for a year... I definitely don't feel I can call myself an intermediate yet but YMMV!! :)) this wasn't the most challenging practice at all (which is often what I like) but I have found it the best so far. Something about the flow of the sequence is so lovely, and made me feel emotional in a way normally only a session with a lot of hip openers does (holla if you know what I mean!). It's a reminder that though for me yoga started as a way for enhancing my flexibility/fitness, in fact the best thing it is giving me is mindfulness. I find meditation etc very challenging, having a very busy mind, and during this weird time it's been buzzing like mad. These classes really do help me find my centre.

After the practice ended I teared up and could not stop smiling :) It really is like magic and you never know when you're finally going to understand what it's supposed to feel like.

Before coming to the mat, I was feel slightly hesitant, but all I needed was less than a couple minutes into the practice to understand the importance of just showing up. I felt elegant doing all the poses, and my body was synchronizing by himself to both the movements and the breath. I felt strong. Day 7 was the day that I noticed a little calmer mind, even though there were still some thoughts popping up here and there. One week later, I feel the evolution, I feel the motivation, I feel the joy. I am so happy. Thank you!

I usually get fatigued with any challenge by the end of the first week, and with what's been happening in the news, my heart has felt 10 times heavier than it normally does.

So, I dragged myself out of bed, threw on comfy clothes, and rolled out my mat, fully intending on just sitting on my mat and listening to her voice. 

But then she invited us to breathe together, and I took that breath. I realigned. I got in sync. And before I knew it, I was flowing through these warriors and loving the windmill arm stretches, and absolutely living for her saying ""Who cares? Life is good."" 

So to anyone who's feeling a bit of fatigue (from anything, really), I invite you to take that first breath with us. Start with that, and see what happens.",UgzD2xGQB8EJH7k3lM94AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-08T18:26:06Z,0.9974340796470642

I am so grateful to have this space to breathe. I have found myself ""taking my breath off the mat"" in the last week. It's actually working!

1586.0,"I have been doing all the calendars the past months and it helped me so much ! Yoga is so good for my self esteem because I learn by doing yoga that each part of my body is beautiful, strong and alive inside in it's own way. One part have more flexibility but is less strong, one part have gracefulness, one part is strong as hell but hey no synchronization yet here and that's ok. No perfect body, but alive and true body that supports me. Taking care of my breath helps me with anxiety and to stay in the present moment and taking awareness to my core helps me emotionally and I never taught it would do that effect. I feel more supported. I feel that I am enough. So all this paragraph to say I'm so happy this new 30 days yoga journey started because you come generously with a new practice, new moves and new ways to feel the practice (just the diagonal breath and slow movements at the beginning of our practice today... WOW !) and that brings an awesome freshness in my regular practice, it's like a new start, bringing me back to the basics consideration of breath and quality of movement and to give love to myself for all littles accomplishments.

He came by and gently interrupted my practice to ask if he could still use my pesto sauce on his pasta which looked mouldy. I said yes and this was a micro-journey inside my day 7 in 30-day yoga journey. At the end of the day, how important is this?

2186.0,"Hello Adriene! I wanted to let you know, how much your videos mean to me. I am going to turn 20 in march, our country is still knees deep in the pandemic and I cant really say, that we will get out of it any time soon. I‚Äôve been at home (with my parents only) since the 6th of March and I live literally in the middle of nowhere. I graduated in june and got accepted to the university, basically all via zoom. So all I could do for the three months was to sit around and study, couldn‚Äôt even meet with my friends and the rest of the family.
I struggled with depression in the past, but during this whole pandemic it all got a bit worse. But your videos really helped me to get out of my head and reconnect with my body. I tried some workouts, but I usually struggle to keep up with the girls in the videos. But when you say keep it going (usually while doing the plank pose haha) I do! It‚Äôs your kind voice that keeps the body going.
I just wanted to let you know, how much are your videos appreciated. I did last years 30 days journey by myself, but now I encouraged my friends to join me and they love tour videos too!
Really, thank you. It seems, that I will have to be at home for another semester, but now I have something to look forward to.
