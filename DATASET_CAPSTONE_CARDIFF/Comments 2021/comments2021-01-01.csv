I do yoga maybe once every few weeks but I’m thinking about doing it every day. For all you yogis does yoga help strengthen and tone the body as if you were using weights or doing high intensity workouts? I was thinking about for cardio riding my stationary bike in the morning and then doing yoga in the afternoons To keep a good balance of cardio and strength. someone told me that the reason I keep hurting my lower back is that maybe because my abs are not strong enough. They also said that yoga is very good in building core muscles is this true? All I know is things to Covid and losing my job I have had no motivation to really work out and the high intensity workouts, when I do go to do them they just seem to hurt me.

Thank you for your videos!

I've just started your 30 day trial. You've made Yoga accessible to me so thank you....

But what do you mean by ""arrive"" at yoru breath and ""invite""? 
I'm struggling to visualise how to do that.

Also, apart form the plank, I find simply sitting up straight and keeping my head above my heart really difficult.

241.0,Why did I not see these videos earlier. Why did I not turn on notifications. Why didn’t I begin in time. That’s ok. I am here now. I will set the intention and begin tomorrow. Today with this short welcome breathing video. Setting the intention. Forgiving myself and remembering I was meant to see this series today for some reason. So today is a wonderful day.

I have practiced in various locations where I have lived and for some reason felt more grounded and in the flow during this one class--am excited about the coming days offerings. I bow to your graciousness in offering these for free and for so many years!!. It goes without saying that many of us are struggling to make ends meet during this time and the first things to go are often the yoga studio or gym memberships. So happy to have found your channel.

The Adidas thing is starting to really get to me though......possibly because - if I'm not mistaken - this is the first time that the Adidas logo has been visible throughout the entire video. It looks like they're beginning to own you.
Is Adidas really how you identify? I'm not talking about the aesthetic only (although it feels so off for you), but more importantly the myriad ethical doubts surrounding Adidas.
Just wondering if you've signed some exclusivity contract with them for way too long......and, if you have maybe you also have an NDA restricting you from speaking openly and clearly on this matter.
I hope if that's the case that you're on the tail end of both things (contract & NDA).
You don't have to answer these questions, and I guess you may not even be (legally) able to, and that's fine.
Please don't feel criticised here. That's really really not my intention. I admire both you and the work you do very greatly, and I totally understand that sponsorship is necessary in order to continue to provide it. I just hope that you can find good sponsorship from a brand more aligned with the values that (I understand) you to represent. Putting out the good vibes for you, sister!

557.0,Hello! I've done many 30-day challenges but this is my first live one so I'm pretty excited. My only comment is that I was really surprised with that wrist inversion on the table top. I'm pretty experienced and it hurt a lot - I just went in very tiny circles.

Cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded, lament and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy into gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of God and he shall lift you up. 

The apostles of Jesus Christ preached the way of salvation the day the New Testament began saying “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This promise is to you and to your children and as many as the Lord my God shall call. No man cometh unto the Father but by Jesus Christ and as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and those that are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.

I am doing the challenges with a friend in the Netherlands. It is a great way to connect even though we are far apart. Looking forward to the next 29 days.

641.0,Ok so I was planning on not doing the Yoga Journey this year as I have been following a different yoga program in the last few months and I was pretty eager to get working on my handstand practice... More focus on the physical ability. But I thought I would just check out what this year's journey was about. When I watched the intro and first video I knew it was just what I need right now. Breath to ground us into our reset year! Slow down and ground. I can always get back to the physical focus next month... But right now I feel like I need grounding to bring me into this new year and after the shit storm of 2020. Thank you for all that you do for your community! You sure have created something wonderful! 💖,UgxnYbgTn0voX2doYh14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-02T15:41:55Z,0.9987837672233582

1001.0,"Hello! In ""the before time,"" I practiced yoga 3x/week at a hot yoga studio and was a mess if I went more than a few days in between. Then the pandemic hit, and I started doing yoga at home with the classes my studio live streamed. But, it just wasn't the same for so many reasons, and my practice frequency, duration, and intensity dropped--and dropped some more. I knew about YWA, but was really committed to using the videos from my studio with my familiar teachers. Well, they had to stop live streaming videos because they ran out of money and had to go dormant until after the pandemic passes. So, I turned to YWA and have really loved both Adriene's personal style and warmth as well as the ability to find a video to meet any and all of my random, ""I wonder if she has one for ____"" searches. The most recent: Yoga after a long trip. Bingo! Thanks, Adriene, for being there for all of us.

I found your channel last year and it has played a big part in trying to instill healthy habits and routines in my life, though I often fall off. But I've always enjoyed your sessions as they make me smile and laugh and also reflect. I think its when you mentioned the showing up is the hardest part is when something tipped over within me and the water gates flooded. I struggle a lot in the day to day, just with a will to live and a purpose. Its my greatest desire to find it. My username is Achieve Peace because that is my main goal in life. I want to thank you for your compassion and sharing your knowledge. I look forward to focusing on and practicing my breath these coming 30 days & will do my best to connect with this feeling when I don't want to get on the mat as its a great reminder as to why I should.. This feeling is love and support. I truly feel you have love and want the best for your viewers and as someone who lacks a support system, it truly means the world to me. THANK YOU ADRIENE, &BENJI!

I got frustrated that there was so much more of me to move around and I couldn't do things as easily as I used to.  I honestly debated committing to this challenge because my doctor said I mainly need cardio and muscle toning, but I nearly started crying watching the first video, and I knew I made the right decision.  I'm going to have to get up very early to do the videos (I'm a teacher) but I know the challenge will be worth it.  I wish you all a happy new year and look forward to our yoga journey together!

1660.0,"How a little bit of breathing already made me cry. I don't know why but at the same time I do. So many ambitious goals that were once dreams but I don't want to call them dreams anymore, so much change to come and so much I am not happy about at the moment but at the same time am. I can't organize my thoughts, which clearly makes me very emotional. Third year I'm doing this, though I never did the whole journey the first two years. I am doing this time though. I am going to commit to this thing and I'm excited for tomorrow, probably making me cry again. Your Yoga videos just open something up in me in the best way possible, I feel at home with them, safe and myself, like I can achieve anything I put my mind to.

1714.0,"Listen to this, the most important thing you'll ever read.  
If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16  
God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality, rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in selfish child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the believers in Christ/Christians will be taken up, away with God, then antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, receive Jesus as your savior, believe God raised Jesus from the dead, and repent of your sins, you are now saved by grace!

Also- My husband gifted me a membership with FWFG yoga for 60 sober & I love it, he's a weight lifter and I saw in a couple stories you practice that from time to time. Would you ever do a video on that for beginners or do you have a reccomendation on any videos/training you started out with? -just trying to add a little bit of that to my day after yoga-husband bought me a starter weight set and I'd rather get trained by a video than by him (because i tend to quit right away if i'm not good at something)

2940.0,"I, like many of you, am SO looking forward to this 30 day yoga journey. I have been virtually hangin with Adrienne since 2015, and though I’ve said it before I feel the need to say it again - thank you for this gift you give to all of us so freely and humbly.  It is not only the way you carefully craft each practice with modifications for every skill level or body type, or the way you gently remind us that “we’ve gotta bring the breath”. It is not only your charisma and warmth and humor that make it so easy to return to the mat (okay maybe not always easy, but once we’re there we remember why). It is not only your teachings on self love and compassion, which remind us to find love and pride in who we are right now, in a world that is so quick to tell us otherwise. It is not only the way you gracefully roll with Mis-saying or mis-steps, or groans from your “breathing bolster” Benji, reminding us that no one is perfect and that there is a humanness, a beauty in imperfection. It is also the community you have woven together, with people all over the world from all walks of life who all share the same desire and pull to practice together. This is perhaps the most beautiful thing you and your channel offer. In a time where in-person gathering  is unavailable, when so many are feeling isolated in a time where we need community most. Thank you for creating a safe, welcoming space for us all to gather virtually 🙏🏻 namaste to all and may 2021 bring more light, more peace, more love, more unity for all. ❤️",UgzvLyoYlIxTJK8veVt4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2021-01-01T14:31:48Z,0.9994251728057861

3285.0,"why are you here... what holds you here. these were so clear questions.

Yoga makes me happy, i'm here to (find a) flow and find stilness in my mind, or.. strive to accept it isn't. Im' here to break chains of thoughts that do no longer serve and to find inner peace when possible. I want to be me unapoli... can't spell the word. I want to acces the strength in me, that energy that's always there but for some reason often out of my reach.
AND I WANNA DO SOME COOL ASS YOGA POSES,... and maybe, just maybe  i'll be in touch with my needs, and then improvise, find my flow <3

Reality: probably going to be angry for not beig able to follow or going to fast. Might get frustrated at you adriene, nothing personal. I'll probably do more effort than what's necessary (ty hard instead of easy). I'm very often going to ask myself if i'm doing it right, and question every inch² of my body. ""is my back straight this way?"" ""is my head at the right angle?"" ""shoudln't i be doing this to achieve that?"" ""am i breathing deep enough?"" ""am i doing this pose right to get it's benefits?"" ""is my energy flowing when ...""

What holds me here?

There is something about yoga. When i move and follow that flow, it feels so liberating. I honestly don't get it. it's very very weird to me just because there is so much that i havent learnt yet, and that i don't not know. i just love connecting with myself. And i sometimes succeed when doing yoga. Yoga learns me so much about my mind and my own energy, i can use what i learn in yoga in other parts of my life.
My curiosity holds me here, my will to move forward and discover inner peace, happiness, the present. But honestly also expectations of succes. Sometimes yoga becomes a tool and that's weird, i'm going to try and find balance in that. I sometimes try to use yoga to change how i feel... but that's not really connecting with yourself.

Thank you Adriene for spreading this craft <3 i'm looking forward to the creaky floor, tha AYOO's, the allusions you're going to make, the references that i sometimes don't understand.",UgxOc6tXBLK02hknQmR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-01T12:58:03Z,0.2438219748455874

I'll be following this 30 day yoga challenge from Portugal. Found this youtube channel last April during quarentine and I've been watching your videos regularly since then. Thank you so much for everything, yoga gave me so much already. 

This is the first time I'm following the monthly challenge when it is released and I have a question, are the videos live? Or the time reference is just a way for us to try and do it simultaneously? 

Thanks again and see you soon!

(7hrs ahead of Texas) I moved here in 2011 from Austin, (Actually Buda) Texas. I'm 59 yrs old and I've been bodybuilding since age 12. Started yoga with you on Nov 2nd when the gyms here closed due to Covid. Just recently finished the 30 days of Yoga with Adriene and I'm proud to say I noticed improvement from it. Very much looking forward to combining Yoga with my weight training when the gyms re-open. I really like how you incorporate humor into the lessons as well as giving several variations for people depending on their individual capabilities. You are an EXCELLENT instructor.

3560.0,"Just did a yoga session and a flash of insight came up inside of me which was quite profound. It said something that the magic of this community isn't necessarily Adrienne herself as a separate individual and that she's some sort of authority in relation to her students, but the magic comes from the whole community and everyone's relationship to the practice.

I find that in fitness and wellness circles in general, there is a tendency that you want to find a certain person to be inspired by, some guru to ""believe in"" or some authority who you should be like. In this community, there is a totally different vibe. Here, everyone is themselves their most important guru and their biggest inspiration. Adrienne is more an intention-setter and a messenger of these techniques, but the true difference comes from every single individual who is practicing.

It brought me a great sense of enthusiasm and hope for the future and what's possible if people get this.

These have been such a life-changer for me!!! Knowing that so many other people in the community could be practising at the same time is incredibly motivating. I just want you to know how grateful I am to you for guiding me through this crazy and difficult year. THANK YOU.
