19.0,"I had a major breakthrough this practice. I started practicing yoga regularly a couple months ago, and the mindfulness aspect of yoga has been both beneficial and really frustrating. My mind always wanders. I try to quietly note the thoughts I'm having, but then I start thinking about why I'm having those thoughts in the first place, and then I note those thoughts, and so on and so forth until I'm thoroughly  out of the moment and shaming myself. But this practice, I had a breakthrough. It really resonated when you used the metaphor of welcoming your thoughts like welcoming guests to a party. You notice their knocking, open the door, and briefly greet them before letting them inside. Then they step away to go mingle with the other thoughts/guests to create a special and unique moment in your body, in your home. As the host, you just welcome them with warmth and kindness, until at some point, they leave.",UgwwAcpsFz0YeqQ5p-Z4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-12-21T05:59:44Z,0.9987931251525879

So even though I can't hold all of the positions the entire time and even though I have to take lots of breaks I want to encourage anyone else struggling through the practice to remember that you are here. You made a choice to better yourself even though it is hard and painful. It's okay if you have to adapt the pose's to work for your body, just to sit on your mat and breath is progress. So just close your eyes and take a breath and remember that you can do this!

Like, after finishing day 4, it would launch day 5 (then I just pause and come back the next morning). It's not the case right now: on the last screen of your video youtube launches another random video (like day 18).

I got to the point where it felt like I lost connection to my commitment to daily practice. I put a sticker in my planner every day that I do yoga but despite doing yoga almost every day in January, I wasn't proud when I saw my planner because I knew I hadn't kept the promise to myself I had wanted to. I want to do this with full commitment. The old Jade would beat herself up over making mistakes the first time and then she would never try again. I've been doing yoga with Adriene for a couple years now and I've learned that yoga never wants you to beat yourself up. All yoga requires of you is that you get on the mat again. It doesn't care how long it's been or where your skill level is. all it cares is that you are there today. Now on Day 4, I feel more connected to this practice and myself than I ever felt before. Thank you for everything you've given me Adriene. You are my rock.

Day Four of the journey

today's practice was to listen.

I tried to hear my voice again and again.
But the voices were hard to hear.

What I found out was that is not about ""words""(in my case), 
but about noticing some kind of reaction (sensation) by myself.

And so, my voice told me that I am alive now.


Please take care of yourselves!

I started on Monday, 1/4 (I skipped Wednesday - was too much happening, which was a bit paralyzing, but got back to it Thursday).  Rather than doing this in the mornings (when I meditate and have dedicated time with no meetings to catch up on emails and correspondence), I have been doing this program as soon as my last meeting of the day ends (before I get sucked into lots more follow-up, emailing, etc., for many hours into the evening).  It has been the perfect way to create a boundary between work and ""my"" time in the evening.  While I'm getting the heart rate up a wee bit for some good health benefits, it's also slowing it, and my MIND, down, to focus on me.  Going from the practice to the kitchen to prepare a healthy dinner has become quite enjoyable.  Thank you, Adriene, for this marvelous program and your phenomenal positive energy.

Even though this journey is based on the breath today before practice I took two minutes to do some deep breathing (with my fitbit).  Wow I felt amazing after, and totally ready for today's practice. With the help of your channel Adriene I have found I lose my breath a lot, for a while it was challenging to focus on the breath. Today was different and I feel extremely happy! Different mindset and feeling!!!

923.0,"I hurt myself, I don't know.. a month or two ago. I was pushing on something at work and suddenly between my shoulder blades, right dead center of my spine tensed up like I've never felt before. The deep pain persisted for about a week. I couldn't sit or rest in certain positions without being in agony. Breathing hurt. Though it's gotten better, there are times during my practice that I feel it again. I'm careful not to push too far or too hard. Just trying to wake it up kinda and put some mobility back in it really. At this point I'm not ashamed to admit I'm making modifications to accommodate this section of my spine but in years past I would have pushed through or been embarrassed to admit it, if even to myself.

I really am my best teacher and thanks, Adriene, for reminding me of that today. I'm going to continue to work towards doing what I can and whether or not my pain ever goes away, I don't think I'll forget the lesson.",UgyoZ34TfM9jqIgyiwx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-07T19:40:06Z,0.9938499927520752

The breathing is useful in my other sport activity ( curling - It helps me focus before I deliver a rock down the ice) and I think it is compatible with my creativity too. (I am also a singer and swimmer so different ways of breathing do not feel foreign to me.

I‚Äôm not sure if it is due to being well endowed on top, my legs being way longer than my arms, or my lack of flexibility, but I have a hard time doing the lunges with my knee over ankle with my hands planted on each side. I either can‚Äôt touch the ground or My knee over arcs my ankle. In previous practices of yours I would just do what I believe you call lizard pose, but I am trying really hard to get this down.

I've been going through a rough time the past couple days. Been really struggling with my urge to self harm after a really triggering/lowkey re-traumatizing couple days of interaction with my ex.

It's crazy. I know self harm won't help, but I just want a feeling of control over my emotions after all of these ones bubbled up that I'd thought I'd processed through more. 

Anyway, I know healing isn't linear. I started doing your videos on Christmas day, and I was really happy you were hosting this January practice. It's giving me a healthier focus on loving and nurturing myself, & helping me feel less alone. I'm ngl, even after doing today's video and another one I still have that intrusive thought/urge to harm, but you're helping me NOT act on it. That's important.

1438.0,"Today was a tough day as we started on the back. My back froze with a shooting pain and I felt anxious about it from the minute you said, let‚Äôs lie back in a flatback position. When you started the bridge pose, my body shuddered due to the pain but I tried to force myself to do it which caused more pain. I almost felt like leaving but I focused on slowing down my breath and took 7 minutes to peel myself back to a sitting posture and acknowledging the pain I felt. I stayed, your voice playing while I went to an extended child's pose which is my own resting pose. While you guided through slow bridges, I breathed deep and slow in my extended child‚Äôs pose until I was calmer again. Then I restarted the video, this time by surrendering completely and embracing myself for any pain I felt. And the back pain was gone! I was able to do all the bridges and finished the entire practice. Days like today reinforce the feeling that hardest part is showing up and staying. And I am glad that I stayed and tuned into my breath to bring me back. Thank you for giving the mantra- ‚Äúmy breath is my anchor, my anchor is my breath‚Äù.

At the beginning right before you say it, that moment I actually had the thought that yoga is not about these fancy poses but now i know it's about listening and breathing. Thinking like ""damn how did Adriene know what I was thinking haha"" or is this some sort of coincidence. Now at that moment, i then realized how connected we all are when doing this practice together.  Just when my mind starts wandering, I immediately start listening to my ""ocean breath"" the Ujjayi and it helps tremendously! All my life i haven't been breathing correctly till and I began practicing yoga with you and felt alive through that. What a beautiful thing. Still in awe. We are doing great peeps, we  put an attempt to show up and be with ourselves and that's what I call an act of self-love.

12:22 - grab your thigh and not the lower leg to pull towards your body; use your hands as a little cussion between thigh and lower leg to avoid a too deep stretch in the knee

I always have a little trouble in the low lunges with the knee on the ground. I'm not sure where exactly my knee should touch the ground: right on top of the kneecap? Or a little bit below it? It often feels quite uncomfortable, because it feels like my kneecaps are being pushed to an unnatural position, if you understand what I mean.
I would like to know how it is positioned correctly, so I don't accidentally hurt myself ... üò¨",UgwLFI1uZKJq2PG1N3Z4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2021-01-05T20:14:14Z,-0.9948118925094604

This morning was fun because I came to practice right out of bed, so it was as much a wake-up as an exercise routine.  This one was a lot slower, which I think worked pretty well for that; we'll see if I can make it this early on other days, and how they go in return.

More work on using the ujaii breath to keep focused even when my brain is running off to other things.  And yes, I did have to pause during the opening listening on our back to quiet my head down for a while, before I could pull it back in.  And that was okay, and allowed, and when I did it I felt better and was able to focus better, so it was worth it.

I really appreciate the days we're on our hands a little less.  My wrists get so much use with typing and knitting so much all the time, and I'm working on strengthening them, but they HURT sometimes, and there's not a lot of good modifications for easing up on them a little.

I found myself using the deep breaths from yesterdays practice from the time I woke up today, consciously breathing in deeper and trying to make them longer than usual. 
Even when we went for a swim I was able to lengthen my breaths so I could glide under the water for longer, giving myself more time to enjoy the beauty of the lake.  
I find yoga is becoming part of my daily life and I'm going to strive to carry this inner peace with me when I head back to work.  That is my intention for the year.
