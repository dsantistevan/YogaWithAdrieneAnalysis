So, first, if we're holding a difficult pose - especially if it's a weight bearing one - please keep the chatting shorter.  Collapsing is easy if you're heavy and that's not ego boosting.  Second, some of these moves aren't easy if you have to work around your belly - even walking to the top of the mat and bringing one leg up to the front of the mat from down dog.

It's a nice pace that really helps you establish and maintain your base when it comes to yoga (something even experts can struggle with). I love your message of self-love and your attitude of accepting your limits and doing what makes you feel comfortable- one of the main reasons I joined yoga- instead of ""pushing past the pain"". In everyday life I always feel like I'm behind in life and that I will never be enough, however whenever I do your yoga videos I feel enough for myself even if I'm not always able to do all the yoga positions in the video. I recommended you to my therapist since I've found it a lot easier for self-acceptance whenever I do your yoga videos as a routine for myself.

220.0,"WOW!! I REALLY knocked on heaven's door today haha. That control, listening to and trusting myself, giving myself permission to veer off the tracks as much as I need, and also trusting Adriene's guidance in the speed and timing of the practice, all served me well this morning. When it came to the knocking on heaven's door, I felt hesitant at first, not because it makes me feel silly, but because I felt like I could find a profound stillness in that moment. Instead, I trusted you, and went ahead with it because I do like that movement. I found myself moving faster and faster with the breath of fire to lead me. It was power. Now that was strength in stillness if I ever felt it. I actually just stood there and breathed for minutes after the video ended! Not even choosing to lay down or sit. Thank you for turning my day around. I will listen to and trust myself in all that I've got going on today.

438.0,"I am so grateful for this program <3 I came to the mat today experiencing more anxiety than usual, worried that I would have a panic attack or be stuck in the anxiety cycle all night. But I showed up, got on the mat, and it all slowly started to melt away. Through these practices my mat has become my sanctuary, my safe place. When you talked about our willingness to let things transform rather than being fixed that was the perfect thing for me to hear. I noticed how much, even though I didn't want to be anxious, how much I was holding onto that fear of the fear, how stiff that felt, and when I surrendered and chose to let it all go, it all really did start to shift. By the end of the practice I had found that sense of peace within me again, and I had the biggest joyful smile on my face :) A huge weight had been lifted and I felt free to move through my life as my truest self again, not weighted down by anxious thoughts. The very first thing that I wrote in my journal was ""my yoga mat saves my life"". These last few years I have experienced a level of anxiety/PTSD that truly did take the life that I love away in many ways. But my practice, and these videos, give me back hours/days that I may have otherwise spent in negative or anxious thoughts and emotions. They bring me back to myself and help me to let go of all that does not serve me, so that I can live this one wild and precious life that I have in a state of joy, playfulness, and comfort; rather than being controlled by or lost in anxiety. While I have taken an active role in healing my anxiety/PTSD through reading books, joining groups, going to therapy, and more, I want you to know that your videos have played a HUGE role in my healing/recovery, and I am just so grateful for these videos and this community. Often they are the only thing that can truly shift my energy when I need it the most. My practice, the practice that you have guided me to, truly is saving my beautiful life in such a deep way. Thank you, all of you who make these videos possible, thank you so much for putting this out into the world so that it can reach people like me. Much love to you all <3 <3",UgzUzL8EyqIrFotppfN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-23T09:04:10Z,0.9977197051048279

I love how your practices are all about connecting your mind with your body, and goes without saying that at a crazy time like this - it has given me rhythm and stability all at the same time. 
One thing I have found increasingly amusing though, is how one of my cats now likes to be present in the room with me whilst I practice - which is completely new. Perhaps it's the routine of me unfolding my mat every day, or maybe it's your calming voice; but she comes and lays near me and I realise because of this I look forward to this practice every day but for a completely unexpected reason now.

I've been doing yoga at home for a while and have gotten super used to just trying to find what feels good and letting go of any shape comparisons or feeling silly. Of course it's easier to do within a solo home practice and Adriene's kind guidance has gotten me here, but today as I was shamelessly smacking my booty with my chest out and head held high I wondered if I would be able to carry this feeling, this way of movement to a public yoga class.

Wanting to breathe slowly (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and pay attention to the 'how' of the movement, I felt rushed through the postures and then frustrated. I felt I had no time to find what feels good. And maybe even more so when there's was plenty of time to knock on heaven's door, whereas there had been too little time for all that came before.
