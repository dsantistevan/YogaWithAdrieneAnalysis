Day  9 of the journey

Balance pose are difficult.

But it's important to keep trying to find balance.
I found that little by little my core was strengthened and my balance was maintained.

Good practice to find the center.


May this new day be a good one for everyone.

1020.0,"Something I thought about today:
Balance is hard. Balance in life, I mean. I know in my life, I'm always struggling between that push and pull, how much to give to others vs. how much to give to myself, how much to rest vs. how hard to work, how much to stay stubborn vs. how much to concede. This practice was also hard, but... fun. It's a metaphor for life, I think. Finding the balances of life is part of the journey, and a huge part of that journey is to play with the forces that push us in order to find balance. 
Now, time for coffee before I wax too philosophical, but as always: Thank you, Adriene <3",Ugz6eAC2b8OKdgDzKsh4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2021-01-10T18:15:12Z,0.997689962387085

I did that whole section opposite and it seemed off a bit especially when she then had us do the same side twice. She didn‚Äôt, but I did. I rewound afterward to see what went wrong.

My mind was all over the place today, it's easy for me to go in automatic mode in balancing postures as they are quite easy for me. But another super interesting thing I noticed is for the first time ever, I was able to transition from cobra to down dog via plank. I usually get to my knees.

I kept having to pause the video and start again and it made me super annoyed. I almost gave up half way but then I thought ""this is dumb, I'm on day 9, I've done 8 videos without quitting in the middle why should this one be any different?"" So I put my puppy downstairs with my brother, restarted the video and reset my mind. In the end, I'm very glad I restarted because this turned out to be my favourite video yet. (Thank you Adrienne)

1484.0,"Every time a see a one-legged posture in the video preview, I get a little frustrated. Balancing on one leg is really not my strong suit as my ankles tend to dance around when I do them. I used to get foot cramps when standing on one leg, I got super angry and was avoiding the balancing work. 
But magically, Adriene persuaded me to accept where I am and work there. Today, after a couple of years, I don't get cramps in the feet,  I can stand on one leg (there's still some wiggling, haha), I am noticing the difference between right and left, differences between days (somedays I still fall, oh yes). I try to laugh off the falls, begin again, enjoy the process. 
In the end, it's working on our weaknesses that brings the biggest change. Seeing you CAN evolve, seeing it's not ""just who you are"". A beautiful lesson to take off the mat as well, don't you think?
One thing that also really helped me ... My cousin is a ballerina, so I talk to her a lot about balance. She said that it helps her to consider this in balancing the body: ""Every part of you is carrying itself. It is not up to your foot (or any other part) on the ground to bear all the weight."" It helped me a lot, together with engaging my core, learning the bandhas, working on leg strength to manage the slightly bent knee (it's still hard work, man!), but especially working on my MIND.
So, whatever you struggle with, it's ok. Lean in, discover, make space and leave judgment off the mat. Namaste, my friends. Can you believe it's DAY 9 already???",UgzihFihABCbINsbNut4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-10T09:20:01Z,0.9977413415908813

I feel mentally weak during these days and I'm just trying to hold myself together. So I thought:""Maybe I could sleep one more hour..."" but then my sense of responsability hit me and I decided to get up. Looking on my phone I saw the notification of today's practice with Adriene, as always around 7am. And I just couldn't let myself stay in bed any more. Because in just nine days I think this has become part of my mornings: my boyfriend, who I live with, is still asleep and I have this time exclusively for myself, I'm not seen by anyone (except our dog, Midnight, that keeps me company like Benji!) and I feel... I don't know, free? Alone but at the same time connected, with all of you who are doing this practice. So thank you for this calming, conforting and encouraging connection. See you tomorrow.
