2.0,"I’m doing this challenge over a year after it was posted and I’m so glad I am doing it! I did it every day until day 11 and then I had a break for two days and now I’m back. I loved that I can do that squat. I worked hard for years to practice and get the hip flexibility needed. Even though I’m pretty overweight so many of the bending poses are hard because I can’t breathe, the squat is something I can proudly do well! Those down dogs are getting easier too, even though my wrist and hand pain is awful as I have RSI in my hands. I will persevere!

29.0,"This one was very easy and calm. Even though I definitely think that my flexibility still is a disaster, I can also feel that I actually am improving - poses are becoming easier and I can get a better stretch on them, I don't feel nearly as weak or shaky and my lower back pain is pretty much nonexistent now. For me, the most difficult thing still is to just show up. When I actually begin the practice, even if my mind was all over the place beforehand, I actually have no trouble at all finishing it whether it's 18 minutes or 40 minutes.
Definitely feel much better than I did when I started, even though I had to take around 5 days off in between due to an illness. Actually, all of this has felt much easier since then for some reason. Perhaps the illness allowed me to take my time to rest which was something my body needed.

Also, Squat's always been pretty easy for me, I routinely rest in the squatting position and all and always get up from the ground with a squat so finally a move I can do fully without having to compensate for it anywhere or do some different variations.",UgwWBuVnkL5bVx3Yt154AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-11-14T19:35:03Z,0.5477671027183533

344.0,"The first three days of the practise, my muscles were really sore and I felt exhausted. Now, it's like I can barely feel a thing when I'm done. I realised I'd gotten used to thinking about pain as evidence of something working, because I was wondering if the workouts had become easier. But they haven't because it's still not so easy to drop into some of te poses or follow the transitions or link my breath with my movement the way she dos. I still worry that I'm not getting the poses right. Nothing has changed beyond the absence of muscle soreness. 

And I simply wonder, in life, do we use pain as a marker for growth? And how do we change our thinking to view only the right metrics as a marker for growth?",UgwM-GmehAEDXgy61Vt4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-23T08:00:24Z,-0.994229793548584

544.0,"I'm doing Breath along with four friends and family.  We created a little Messenger group so that every day we can report in, encourage one another, and comment on how we found each day of Breath.  It's been an amazing experience in these isolated times.  While the bigger YWA groups are fine, being accountable to people I already know well is particularly motivating.  Already more than once someone messaged that they were just too tired or stressed to do Breath, and the rest of us encouraged them to the point that they found the time, and then posted that they were so thankful for showing up on the mat!  We get to laugh together, too--when one of us complained about how they kept blowing snot out during alternate nostril breathing, or another about the fact that we can hear your heartbeat through your mike during the quieter parts of the practice :)  This is the next step for me with yoga--one of the friends in this group told me about you at the start of the pandemic, and I've been appreciating your approach and your wonderful videos ever since.  Doing Breath live, with others, is helping me get more comfortable, as well as stronger and more flexible, in my own skin and muscle and bone...and spirit!

547.0,"I am just trying to get into this one today but I am so distracted by my feelings about my body. I am currently isolating with covid. Before xmas I put on some weight. I thought I would do the 30 days of yoga as a mindful way to move my body and hopefully connect with breathing, love for myself and moderate eating etc. So with being isolated and moving less, and having no taste or smell, I feel very depressed. I just sat on the mat and could feel my boobs and belly hanging over and crushing together and I feel so disappointed in myself for letting my body get to this level of discomfort. However, I also know that wellness begins in love. Does anyone else struggle with this? I will just push through it but needed to reach out.

818.0,If anyone else had the misfortune and got sick during this 30days. (like me) Don't be sad/mad! Listen to your body/mind and just continue this 30days when you are well. Just to uphold the spirit /routine of the daily practice you can still check in with yourself every day and see how you feel and do some of the breath exercises.  Although an awful congested nose might make breath exercises awful.  So I guess even that is optional.

885.0,Ya' Allah - so fine. I'm a swimmer - have been swimming competitively since I was 7 & when a chap was teaching me tummy breathing for stress management it did not come intuitively. I examined how the diaphragm works in breathing & I had to imagine that it going down and pushing my tummy out and the air was sucked down to my belly & I put my hands there to feel them pushed out. This is great. As a BudaPest to an Austonian - keep breathing weird.,UgyNqmB0h3oBMbmEOwZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-13T21:12:35Z,0.8085300326347351

I was reading the comments and it reminded me that I can show up just as I am. So I did. This practice was the perfect way to drop into where I was. Tired and in pain. I dropped into what felt good, what was nourishing to my heart and body, I simply showed up and then the rest was so gently guided by Adriene and Benji.

993.0,"I have been struggling with some internal conflicts recently and I'm currently trying to figure out 'me' again. The crazy world that we're all currently living in right now has stripped back many of life's luxuries, almost leaving my soul completely naked and exposing me to all things that are not helping me serve my truth in life. Every day I find myself fighting these mental and emotional battles, and yet everyday when I come on the mat, yoga practice with Adriene helps me to clear my mind and brings me back on track. My next goal is learning to take my breathe and practise with me off the mat. 
Thank you Adriene, you are truly a blessing. Especially in current dark times.
And thank you to every single one of you guys too - i often read the comments after I practise and seeing all your stories about overcoming hardship and difficulty with yoga really helps me believe that I will overcome this too.

1006.0,"This was a good session for me. I had a bad night with my blood sugars, went very high and I’ve been struggling to get them back down today. I’m feeling icky and glad to have a shorter session. I’ve noticed that yoga helps bring them down from time to time. Not only because of the exercise/activity but because I feel relaxed afterwards. Which, I think, helps cleanse the cortisol, a stress hormone which can make the body insulin resistant. So relaxing helps the insulin become more effective. 💛 Cross your fingers for me 🤞",UgxsAlazgrrCqcxrLwt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-13T18:44:27Z,0.9586308002471924

I was pessimistic and frustrated for the first few minutes but something shifted during the twists and I found some ease. It wasn't a miraculous transformation into a positive mood--and I don't think that's the objective of yoga--but I was so gratified that following through with my daily practice and following Adriene's guidance today shifted me more than I thought possible half an hour after my cranky wake-up.

1392.0,"I missed out on 9 days of this challenge because of my own personal insecurities that I considered a bad start of a new year and wanted to say it’s gonna be a bad year just because these couple of days were not perfect as I imagined. Then I remembered that i don’t have to wait for the new year to become a new me, I can do it anytime and drop in anytime I want to change my life. Yoga alongside dance changed my day and yesterday I made a promise to give myself this time to be vulnerable, to practice with my emotions and feel my body performing what I feel deep inside learning how to be a better version of myself, I wish to transform this year mentally and build a good relationship with myself, build my outer world with my attitude that can change everything. So that I practiced yesterday, did yoga video from day 9 and then I turned out to be on my Matt this morning as well and am already feeling gratefulness for doing this two days in a row.

I really didn’t want to come to the mat today, I am feeling all the feelings and spent most of my practice getting distracted and feeling frustrated, but I kept going, I kept trying to arrive at the breath and bring myself back to the present moment. 

In that dedication I found myself so grateful that even through the hard times I have learnt to show up for myself and within that practice I am forging an even deeper relationship with me. I strive to never abandon myself again, especially when I’m needed most. So I will continue to show up and continue to be here.
