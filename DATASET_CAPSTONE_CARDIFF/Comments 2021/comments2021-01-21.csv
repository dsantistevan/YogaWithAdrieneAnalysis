11.0,"This was a wonderful practice, I'm following one of Adrienne's 30 day journeys for the first time and it is just what I needed. I have a question about the breathing technique in this session though: during the pause, do you ""close"" your throat and lock the air away in your lungs, or do you keep your throat opened? I hope I'm explaining this correctly! It seems like quite a different experience with an open versus a locked throat during the pauses, so I wonder what the ""right"" way to do it is. Anyway, lots of love to everyone who is following along with these videos along with and after me, and thank you so much to Adrienne for facilitating this loving journey to all of us <3",UgzwHcIxa3MMoY5Bn8x4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-12-06T10:52:18Z,0.9997276663780212

18.0,"In my 6 months or so of doing Yoga with Adrienne, this is the first time I've heard Lotus pose even mentioned. I've noticed that you don't have any videos for lotus. 

Lotus pose was what brought me to yoga in the first place, because I was working towards a rubber guard in jiu jitsu. During my quest, I popped ligaments below both knees, and they took a couple weeks to heal. Lotus is still tight, but I can now do most Rubber Guard positions. 

Shapeshift Wellness says that there is NO WAY to practice lotus or even half lotus safely. I'd like to hear some opinions from the YWA community.

264.0,"Day 20: such a NICE practice.

Took a couple of days off for a three-day migraine, but this was a good way to get back into it.  It always feels a little weird, if I miss a day or two right before a 'soft' practice like this one, because oh, why couldn't I have just done it a couple of days ago, why do I need a restful practice if I just rested for three days--but that's not necessarily the point.  Even if I've spent a couple of days being quiet, the moment to just BE PRESENT is worth so much. 

This month (last month, the rest of this month, however long it takes me to get through this sequence, whatever I come to next) is a journey, but I'm always reminding myself that a journey doesn't need to just be about its destination.  Am I getting better at yoga?  Yes.  Is just _doing the thing_ worthwhile, whether I learn or not, whether my knowledge or practice is changed or not, just for the sake of doing it?  YES.  I become a little more, learn a little more, change a little more, every time I do this, but it doesn't have to be about who I am becoming.  Sometimes it's just about who I am being.",UgwZ3YqX0KOwnj3JMCp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-02T19:26:39Z,0.7306902408599854

303.0,"You know, I struggled with yoga 2 years ago. I found it boring and slow. I didn't understand what the teachers where talking about, I felt silly and awkward. Then a friend suggested I do a yoga teacher training course. I thought ""why not?"" .....a month before the course and my flight to India, I realised I had never practiced yoga before so I better start now. Then I found yoga with Adriene and I did my first 30 day yoga challenge. Her expansions and hints at more deeper spiritual connections during the practice really helped me to create a small foundation before I jumped into the deep end. That month in India was the hardest, physically and mentally, I have ever worked. I loved it so much. 
In 2019 I did my second YTTC to learn again, and now I'm doing my second 30 day yoga challenge with Adriene, and I can really feel the difference. I still struggle with my self practice, I don't want to teach (I only did the YTTC for more in-depth knowledge) so Adriene's course is really amazing in keeping me grounded in my practice and present. 
So thank you Adriene for being there at the start of my journey and now as I continue to learn and grow.
Lots of love.",UgyH_cCnldaECXcKGFx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-29T20:15:14Z,0.9993820190429688

319.0,"This breath training is so perfect in general but also as a singer it's very connected to the breathing exercises we use. I had started reintroducing these exercises recently as I had lost some strength there but was failing to do it every day and now with this daily practice and strengthening the core it couldn't be more perfect. Since Day 1 I have been so much more aware of how I stand when I'm doing simple things like pouring my coffee, feeling the even weight in my feet, and even walking differently - hip bones and heart forward and lighter on the feet and notice some lower back pains starting to fade. I'm just so surprised at how much I WANT to do this everyday even when it's hard. Thank you.",Ugxxly-OLSuMgR7r9wl4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-28T13:12:55Z,0.9938204884529114

I’ve been journaling through this whole journey and on day 18 Center, you had questions to ask ourselves. What is our relationship to center? I wrote down “I try to check in daily and be mindful of my thoughts and actions. How I react to certain situations and to try and center myself when I feel I’m falling off.”

470.0,"I have come to realize that even when doing my yoga, it is hard to pause and actually feel my body. Yes, even when I breathe through each pose. My mind is elsewhere as a new mom wondering about the baby napping or playing in front of me or my to do lists that never seem to be able to get done. I disassociate so much and easily. I feel as if I’m just kind of floating through/ going through the motions of life these days. I know I need to pause and slow down, but then even less stuff gets done. I also have 2 amazing mini poodles that bark at every noise in the hallway or outside and I’m constantly yelling no. I also am trying to still reconnect with myself and who I am now after giving birth and becoming a mom (my baby is 5.5 months old now). I feel as if my vulnerability, especially in my center, is putting up a shield. These yoga classes so far are helpful, but I still am struggling to connect with my body and self.

491.0,"I found my exquisite moment of total stillness today for the first time!!! To all those who have kept on this path faithfully and to all those who have taken a literal pause in this journey as they find a way to fit themselves through this practice into their daily routine, you are right where you are meant to be. You pause so you can return to movement with a greater appreciation for the ebb and flow of life. In my past experiences practicing 30 days, I had to take a few days off, no motivation, cravong laziness, my body hurting from its monthly cycle, but this is the first sequence of 30 days where that hasn't happened yet. I think this is the first time I'll make it fully and completely. But I cherish the beginning where I listened to my body, craving toxicity for a couple days, before jumping back into this healthy, nourishing practice. We have to see the dark before we can truly see the light. And even then, we need both within us and around us to live the fullest life.

Its always been one of those things, that when I turn up for a class my body is like, I NEED THIS, THIS IS WHAT HAS BEEN MISSING! But actually attending a class would be a challenge.

This 30 day commitment has taken it to the next level, and I'm actually looking forward, and planning where I can slot that 30 minutes in! The breath has been something I've been wanting to explore more for a while, and this gentle approach is just perfect!

Surprisingly, you made me feel ever closer to her tonight. When you told us to look at our beautiful selves - I’ve always been complimented for having my mom’s beauty. She was the most beautiful person, inside and out, I’ve ever known. And then your wonderfully goofy personality when you sang, what I think is, a Whitney Houston song. My mom instilled in me to be goofy and authentic and to always have fun. That’s a huge reason why I do yoga with you. I get your personality, and it feels real to me.

Just by the way... Life continued happening today, and it was a strange day on the mat. It turns out I got my period on the day it was time to give blood. Figured this practice was perfect since you shouldn't do any tough exercise on your blood giving-day, but my body started feeling strange just from breath retention, like never before. Right at the end I realised I would faint if it continued any longer.

785.0,"Well this is weird. I'm following these classes online for about five years and never posted a comment, but as I try to practice this breath retention I have to admit this is very difficult for me and I don't understant why. I'm in my mid-twenties, healthy, no smoking etc but... I can help but feeling like I'm drowning when I'm doing this. How can I explain better with my not so good english... It's, especially when I retain the breath after the exhale, it's like I'm having a panic attack or something, I keep telling to myself ""you're not gonna die"" but it feels like it. Really, like I'm drowning, and after that it's very difficult not to inhale in a hurry. And so I'm here trying to do this exercice and just this kind of breathing make me all hot and sweety and very discomfort, much more than abs work. So, I don't know if I'm doing this badly or if it's my heart naturaly beating faster, or If it's my natural anxiety coming to say hello. Anyway, I wanted to share my experience. I also want to add a beautiful thank you, merci, namaste to Adriene and this channel, which I'm following every single day for yes, I think, five years now (everybody around me is saying : you are doing yoga EVERYDAY ? Waou ! I just want to respond that I HAVE TO otherwise I would be a mess) It has help me managing my anger, my anxiety, my mood swings, and help me have a stronger body. My mind is still not at peace but I'm slow : starting with the body to ease the mind, because the hardest part is always, always always the mind... Again : Thank you. You are a life saver.

821.0,"Absolutely loved trying out breath retention! 

I have missed two practices up until now due to feeling physically unwell. One was early on and the other was yesterday's practice. It's always a struggle getting back to the mat after skipping a day and today's practice was a perfect one to keep things going. During today's breath work my thoughts went to the days I missed and I noticed I was kind to myself and I was okay with just picking it back up today. 
I wanted to share this because normally I would think ""it's a 30 day yoga challenge I *have* to do it everyday!"" and I would either beat myself up for missing a day or try to play catch up, making mental arrangements thinking ""alright so the one I missed was 25 mins, maybe I can add that onto day x?"". Somehow I would think that if I don't do it _perfectly_ that would take away from the worth of the challenge and in today's pause I realized I had let go of that notion. 

So this is for anyone out there who shares similar unhelpful perfectionist tendencies (myself included): remember you are doing this for yourself. Whatever shape or form you choose to take part in this is valid. You are allowed to modify it in a way that fits you, whether that is skipping a day or even two, following a more extended schedule or taking heavy modifications during practice, it is all okay. Well done for keeping at it in a way that serves you <3",UgzEdXTKMrpPblosucd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-21T22:06:54Z,0.9957247972488403

830.0,For anyone enjoying the concept of the “pause” I recommend reading Mans Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankel. It’s an emotional read since it’s a true story about the Holocaust but it’s very powerful. Frankel talks about how the space between stimuli and our action is where our power lies. It’s where our power to choose comes from instead of just acting impulsively.,UgylByVM2JWVImwjkhp4AaABAg,4.0,21.0,2021-01-21T21:53:08Z,0.9994900226593018

1032.0,"I had to skip the breathing part again, but I think I figured out why it gives me anxiety (and a panic attack if I push through carelessly): Trying to breathe to someone else's count makes me hyper focus on my breath, which causes me to tighten my airways, which feels like a panic attack, so it triggers a panic attack. I think I need to work on my own on slowing my breath down without hyper focusing on it. I'm also going to talk to my therapist to see what she thinks. Learning this in the comfort of my own home was good. I would have a very hard time coming back to yoga if I experienced this for the first time in a public class.

1377.0,"So much I want to share after today's practice!  It's uncanny how the daily practice always seems to know just what I need: I strained my wrist yesterday (playing video games, not in practice) and today's massage and staying off the hands was exactly what I needed. (And I started massaging my feet automatically—before the prompt. Though that was funny.) 

I wanted to learn more about Kumbhaka as well. What are the benefits and how can I integrate it into my practice? Is it primarily a meditative breath or is it also used during asana practice?


I also wanted to share a little story about taking moments of pause off the mat. In general, I've noticed that after months of Yoga with Adriene I find myself pausing for longer and being more mindful about how I react. This week I was able to see the fruits of that work on myself in a very measurable way: I was feeling hurt by two different friends not being as in touch as I would have liked. In the past, I've let my temper get the better of me. But THIS time, instead of being angry and reactive, I was able to pause and take the time to express my feelings and vulnerability in an honest, respectful, and constructive manner. Both of them listened and heard me and we were able to talk about what was bothering me and how we can do better—instead of fighting and exchanging angry words.

I'm really proud of that and also really thankful to you for this gift, Adriene.",UgwgmPYDvjjHBwourgh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-21T13:08:37Z,0.9918203353881836

I came to the mat feeling stressed, I was behind and I wanted something active to work out the stress, but I knew that wasn't what was coming. And when you (Adrienne) says let this pause spill into the rest of your day, I thought 'you have to be kidding me!' And I even felt angry - didn't you know how much I have to do etc etc?
Well, here I am a few hours later, coming back and saying thank you. I'm having a pause right now to talk to you. And the day isn't wonderful or 'fixed' but I'm pausing to be grateful for the little things.

I surely was forced to pause with loud gardening machines working outdoors as well as ambulance syrens. All this noise was testing my mental focus. I did breathe mindfully all the way and in the end I managed  to be grateful for those gardeners ans firemen. Still I couldn't help thinking that if I had started earlier as my alarm clock woke me at 6:45 I wouldn't have experienced the same.
