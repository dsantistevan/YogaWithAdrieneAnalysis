17.0,"Love and truly apreciate yoga with adriene so much. The ""don't get lazy"" threw me off so much. I feel really vulnerable when on the mat and being talked to like my abusive mother would talk to me feels very hurtful and not the kind of language I want to hear when practicing yoga. I wish that Adriene will stop trying to continuously win us over. I hope she accepts that those who are comitted do not need extra non-constructive motivation and those who are taking a break are doing so for their own reasons. Please Adriene, just focus on explaining the sequence and breathing, you're excellent at that part, but leave the motivation for others that are excellent at motivating. Your ""motivation"" does the oposite for me :(",UgxuwJse7O0shzzXU7B4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-12-06T12:45:52Z,0.9734960794448853

135.0,"Went for a walk today and thought ""Geeze, I really feel like I'm on a hamster wheel""...and I MAY have said this out loud because...I was alone and in nature haha. And I graduated college in 2020 and have finally found a job, but it's not really what I want to do full-time, I think. It's crazy when you realize what the working world is--how many hours of life people dedicate to their jobs. I've worked summer jobs before, and worked part-time in college but I don't know...it all seems so strange after so many years of school. 

Anyway, after doing this practice today I read the description, and when you mentioned the hamster wheel bit, I had to smile to myself. Sometimes it is so hard make time for yoga, or to motivate to do this practice when I've missed a few days. But I do feel SO much better when I can commit and make the time. And I really am searching for ways to create meaning and comfort in my life. After finding Yoga With Adriene last March, right when the pandemic hit, I do feel like I have changed my thinking and experience surrounding my body. I notice more how I'm moving, transitions between plank and downward dog feel more natural, and whenever there are days where I don't do yoga (Shhh!) I can actually feel my body missing it--can feel the need to stretch and move.

So thanks lovely Adriene! We do so appreciate you. <3",Ugy3TkQ-_QAs6B6HqDN4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-03-04T03:02:42Z,-0.9845888018608093

217.0,"Day 22: It is _incredible_ how much better everything goes when I have actual traction between my feet and the floor.

Yoga, in general, works so much better when it's not a fight.  And so often it is a fight: fighting my own tiredness and executive function to get to the mat in the first place, fighting my own brain to focus and not get too frustrated when there's something I can't do right away, fighting my own body to try and get it to move right.  Fighting my feet and my balance and my pose and my slippery living room rug to stay upright in Warrior or Star Pose.  And I _can_ fight, and I can even win sometimes, and I gain something when I do, strength and stubbornness and workout, but--god, how much better it all is when it's not a fight at all.

I think, more than anything, that's what I've been discovering this journey.  'Renew' is a good theme for today, when I'm remembering my intention from day one, which was never to be very very good at this, but only to keep coming back and keep trying.  I think I thought, on January 1st, that that meant trying harder the next day when I'd lost the fight, as I inevitably sometimes would.  I think now maybe it means learning to back down, back away, pause and come back and renew when I find the direction things don't have to be a fight from to begin with.

It means previewing the videos so I know what poses I'm in for and don't have to struggle to figure them out mid-practice.  It means rolling the rug back or buying a yoga mat so my feet actually stick to the floor instead of trying to stay upright purely with thigh strength and determination.  It means jumping on the moment in the middle of the morning when my body _wants_ to get up and move, rather than forcing it.  Some days it means no yoga at all, and some days it means coming back and being more proud and satisfied with that than guilty.

Eight more days to this sequence.  Maybe I'll go back and try 'Home' again when this is done.  Maybe I'll move on to something else.  I'll keep going.",UgxkVq5bnUGsiJbc6ZJ4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2021-02-04T16:53:57Z,0.8993872404098511

286.0,"I started the month off so well, then about a week and a half ago I started to lose focus and fell into a really negative place. This grey Canadian winter, especially with this current lockdown, has taken a massive toll on me physically and emotionally. I missed a few days of yoga and screwed up my month of clean eating and just spiralled. Every couple days I would try for the motivation to show up on the mat and catch up on the missed videos, some days I would do two or three videos back to back but never seemed to catch up. Today I found myself 5 days behind on this challenge. I am struggling to be better than my negative thoughts. I have a test tomorrow that I barely had the concentration to study for today. But I just completed day 22, so I'm going to be grateful for that small win and remind myself that in 10hrs I will wake up to a new day and can try again. Day 23 is the new Day 27, right?!",UgyZf78BOhGYUg5YGZR4AaABAg,1.0,1.0,2021-01-28T00:15:13Z,-0.9981642365455627

1016.0,"Today was my favourite practice so far. So many things fell into place. I‚Äôve been doing YWA for two years now,, Yoga on and off before that for  a few years but today when Adriene said ‚ÄòMaybe you just stand there saying - Everything is so integrated, I got this‚Äô that was exactly how I felt. After all those years everything DID feel integrated. There were a few poses in this practice that were impossible or very difficult when I started like stacking the hips in down dog or humble warrior or grabbing my foot during the twist and now they come easy and my movements have a bit of fluidity to them. So to everyone out there struggling thinking ‚ÄòI will never get this‚Äô you will in time. 
And a big thanks to Adriene for gifting me with the poems of Mary Oliver. I had never heard of her before they appeared at the end of some emails and I love them.

I was a bit scatterbrained and distracted for part of it, especially the first triangle and supine twist, confusing left and right, but I got it for the other side each time and it was much better :D I also managed to touch the floor with my fingertips on the second triangle pose, which is a great win! I'll have to try this practice again (I'll most probably start Breath all over again in February anyway), but it was already greatly beneficial and a lovely way to renew my commitment to this daily practice.

1061.0,"Renew has many meanings. The core of the  saying ""each day is new day"" is hard to grasp and embody. 
Today, dear Adriene, you showed how to physicaly feel what it means to renew, it doen't hav to be something we whisper quietly in our heart, it can be loud, bright and flamboyant .
 It all starts with little things , piling up one on top of the other. Each day is a new opportunity to renew something, we don't have to wait till we lose all passion .
Every single moment is an opportunity to start again, no need to wait until the end.
""Thank you"" is the first thing runing through my brainn when I think of you! 
From my heart to everybody's heart, have a wonderful day. Your new start is whenever you decide it to be.
Keep calm and breath.",UgyS4CWJt817_dIo21J4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-23T11:33:23Z,0.9976223111152649
