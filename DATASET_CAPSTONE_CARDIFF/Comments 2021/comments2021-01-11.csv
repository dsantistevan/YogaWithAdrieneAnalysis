0.0,"Connecting to your breath can be as simple as tuning in to listen to the sound of the breath, to anchor a busy mind. 
It can be about getting still and noticing the quality of your breath in the moment. 
It can also be an opportunity to connect to something bigger, much larger than your brain or body, but perhaps a reflection of an energy, or a greater spirit.
May you enjoy connecting the dots of each present moment today in practice… via your breath.",UgzF7IUqQYvzkj1BZyV4AaABAg,48.0,679.0,2021-01-11T14:40:43Z,0.9992882609367371

83.0,"So this was my experience: 

We are going on holiday today, so these travelling days usually mean no yoga. But I decided to get up extra early to do today’s practice in my pajamas, without breakfast and no teeth brushing (my mother was in the shower). 

I really could not connect at all 😩 

My breath felt too smelly, my brain couldn’t function and process instructions (too early) so it ended up being a robotic follow along. I really hated it 😩 

I hope tomorrow is better 🤞🏻",UgzUuMUAY-ijp-2kBOt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-06-04T07:16:31Z,-0.9995908141136169

290.0,"""Falling wit grace"" this definitely hit me deep today. I accidentally ran over a kid yesterday at the elementary school of the kids I au pair for. I don't remember everything but I had checked if there was anyone on the pedestrian's cross walk and there was nobody so I kept on going and as I looked back from the right (to check if there was someone coming from that direction) the kid was already on my car and I immediately hit the breaks but the poor kid went flying. The other side of the road was basically a traffic line of cars wanting to leave the school area and this kid had just assumed it was safe so be just ran through the cars and across the street. We both didn't see each other but he has a broken leg now and needed stitches on his forehead and jaw (as I was informed later). He is otherwise doing well and will recover well based on what I was told as well. I am so glad and relieved that he will be fine. This definitely has taken a toll on me too, mentally of course, I am not physically hurt. My mind keeps wandering back to that awful moment when the kid was practically already lying on my car and then being catapulted through the air. Horrible, horrible, horrible. It sends a shiver through my body every time but of course this situation is mostly about the boy. I'll have to see what happens next (lawyers, police, etc.). It depends also on the parents of the boy but I have told myself that I will accept what will come my way and take this as a learning opportunity to do better in the future (aka learning to fall with grace). I should have driven even slower knowing that kids roam the area but I can also accept that it was also a huge amount of bad luck on my part, if he had arrived 5 seconds earlier or later, he would have collided with the cars in front or behind me (not that then I wouldn't have minded obviously). It is human to doubt our behavior excessively but there is always the component of luck or bad luck when we drive. I would be lying if I said I was fine because it is still difficult to deal with, especially when I have to go back to school today and every other week day to pick up the girls, knowing that pretty much the entire school saw it but I have told myself that I won't hide myself away and if anyone wants to stare or ask questions then I will face this head on. We gotta keep pushing through the fire.

Thank you so much Adriene, for these videos. Yoga is helping me a lot mentally, especially now in this situation. And to anyone who might read this: please be careful when you drive and if you are running late then so be it. Don't rush and take those extra minutes to drive safely. For your and everyone's safety. Life can change so quickly from a normal routine day to the most horrible thing and afterwards we regret it. Take that extra look and slow down even more. Please all be safe!",UgyHxq4h3d1YTsZfxRl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-02T12:07:13Z,0.008969519266300956

Day  10 of the journey

I've been here for 10 days!

In today's practice, I learned that there are many ways to ""connect"" with myself,
sometimes quietly, sometimes rhythmically , sometimes with concentration,
and sometimes with balance.

Connect in each moment.

I'm happy to connect with myself and this world today.
I hope you are all doing well.

553.0,"I love you Adriene so much!  You have brought so much to my life these past 5 months. I have so many loving thoughts about you, and what you are sharing with the world, and yoga.  I have so much respect and admiration for you! 
 I want to share a thought, a small suggestion that comes as a gentle request. Today during the tree pose, I found myself a bit distracted by your talking.  And I know that you are only trying to encourage and instruct everyone with the love and attention you do each day.  But I wonder if perhaps cultivating silence, once everyone is in the pose, might help everyone to help keep their pose.  I know we all must find balance, even during distraction, perhaps especially in distraction. This is just a simple thought I hope you might consider.  But again, I send this wrapped with so much love and respect for you.  These past 5 months and committing to the practice has had enormous impact on my life.  So I bow to you. With love, Namaste.

Today was the first day I genuinely felt like I could hold a downward facing dog properly, due to wrist pain and chronic issues with my hamstrings and calves (thanks to an old roller derby injury and metalwork in my ankle).

638.0,"Day 10:

I'm absolutely trying to push myself to write the little check-in reports on GOOD yoga days too (because if I'm going to write big long self-analysis essays to figure out my own reactions on bad days, I deserve to feel good on the days when yoga feels good.)  Today was a good yoga day!  Why is is so much harder to figure out what to say for that?

Okay, a concrete success: I am getting better at downward-facing dog.  I've never felt good about my downdog.  I've always felt a little unbalanced, and a lot like I'm pouring too much weight into my shoulders.  Today it felt okay!  Today it almost felt GOOD.  My hips were high!  I had good weight distribution!  I wasn't resting my whole body on my wrists and sagging into my shoulders!  It sure the heck wasn't perfect, and lord knows my heels will be sky-high on my downdog for as long as I can still bend into one, but it didn't feel weird and off and obligatory today, and that is WORTH CELEBRATING.

And actually, extended child's pose didn't suck today either.  I think I'm finally getting the hang of it.  (Why is it that the low lunges and warriors and twists and even cobra always feel right-if-hard, and the ""resting"" poses are the ones that always feel off?)  Go me.

I was able to do modifications today without as much struggle, being more mindful of my breath, my lower energy level and tendinitis in both arms that need TLC.

Aa I feel like accidents happen, when I am not being mindful of my breath, body and self care. This practise was wonderful, as I was able to gently strengthen my body, as well as my sense of peace and spiritual self acceptance.

699.0,"I almost didn't show up today because I had a terrible day. But, I noticed, my mood was high, despite feeling low altogether. This made me realize how daily yoga has greatly influenced my mindset. I allowed myself to experience my emotions without any hesitation. Yoga has allowed me to absorb my (very sensitive) feelings, and understand them. I don't expect to experience gratefulness and have a healthy mindset daily, but the idea that I could maintain the feeling of balance while I was on a rocky road is something I really appreciate. Thank you, Adriene, for guiding us.

I've always been on/off with gyms and HIIT workouts, continuously beating myself up if i miss a day or don't perform the way i've anticipated. I LOVE that yoga doesn't make you feel that way. I'm a staff nurse, 12.5hr shifts and work last week really kicked my ass. I didn't do any yoga once home. So i caught up with the days i missed yesterday to get back on track... i didn't feel guilty or disappointed in myself. I knew it was the right thing to do for me. The variety of the practices had me sleeping like a baby last night. Adriene you are wonderful :) and so are all of you showing up everyday. We got this! Namaste xx
