50.0,"There are always some days of Yoga with Adriene that  make me incredibly angry. I find myself swearing at the screen and saying, ""screw you"" instead of namaste. It feels like a betrayal of trust because she knows so many of us can't follow these instructions and posted this video anyways. Today I realized that I can say no. More importantly, that I can respect my own no. Sometimes ""meeting my appropriate edge"" actually means yelling, ""screw you and whatever stupid boat you floated in on. I am not doing it!"" And it doesn't mean I quit or I failed or I wimped out because no, actually, I don't enjoy it when my body feels like it is burning. It means that I am respecting my boundaries--both physical and emotional.  Because you have to listen to yourself first. Sometimes that might look like a corpse pose or some spinal flections instead of whatever nonsense Adriene is doing with an invisible baby lion. So if this has you feeling crappy about yourself/your skill level, I hope you know that you are still a badass. Find some poses that feel good to you and guess what? You've done yoga with Adriene playing in the background. And that is completely valid! <3",UgyxgZgH3gT5rUlg5Fp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-10-07T08:07:13Z,0.5387753844261169

Now I am proud of myself because I was able to complete this lesson without any special difficulties and free myself from bad thoughts in the morning! Thank you! 💜

163.0,"I was technically supposed to do this day yesterday, but I was lacking sleep, feeling very tired, and busy weekend had me doubting day 5 where I felt out of breath and discouraged. So I took a break yesterday and this morning felt renewed determination to give this a try this morning. To my delight it was a lot of fun and for whatever reason I found myself laughing multiple times (my boat was rocking like it was going through rapids XD) and all around felt energetic and renewed. Had I done this practice yesterday, I think it would've added to the discouraged feeling and I wouldn't have been able to appreciate it and come away from the mat feeling refreshed and pleased. :) 
The reminders of ""if you took a break"" felt especially relevant to me in this practice today, and felt like it was Adrienne's way of saying ""hey if you took yesterday off, it's okay, you're here now and you can keep doing this, join me"". Very appreciative, even if that wasn't the intended meaning, it helped me today, so thank you <3",UgzFKMl1cUlS6y-gQ354AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-05-11T17:13:02Z,0.9993810653686523

237.0,Adriene's burn asanas are some of the best exercises for actual real burn especially abs. Been to gyms and worked my ass of under trainers but none of them could actually help with the real deal. This is faabamazing. I save every one of your core burn videos so that I can come back later. Doing them all slowly is what causes the burn. I almost scream out but they feel so good. You know it's working or will work cz of the slow fiery burn. It's difficult as hell but oh-so-good.

Today's practice reminded me that despite my strong abs, and my efforts, I cannot get to flatten that belly. It was an unwelcome reminder. That is not why I came for and really, it made me feel bad.
I know I should be grateful for the free practices and I am. But this kind of exercise, when I just wanted to feel better about myself and my body, was counterproductive.",Ugx1McT-7Q1nDvhARYh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-07T03:08:16Z,-0.9867637753486633

When I first started my home practice a couple years ago it was as a part of your 30 day yoga journey. Since then I have been in and out of maintaining a regular yoga practice and when I felt ready to commit again I found this Breath series. I started a few days late however the timing was actually so Divine as I am currently on a deep inner journey of transformation and letting go, practicing the embodiment of the highest expression of the fire element. Also it's 1/11/2021 today which is very high vibrational and a strong energy for transformation and manifestation which made this Burn Practice absolutely perfect for me today.

But I remembered what Adriene would encourage me to do, follow my heart, listen to what my body needs, and honour it. And here I am today, not behind, but following my pace.

1246.0,"Showing up to the mat refreshed and restored from yesterday’s event by an extended time of rest and meditation.  The breath of Fire leading the way; passive and active, yin-yang, dark-bright, negative and positive. Dualism interconnecting and interdependent creating  energy, reducing my anxiety, and giving a big boost to my brain.  Oh the brain, takes over, the mind starts wandering seeking greedily the heartbeat and it founds it. A smile, pleasure, and excitement “Is there, I hear it”’my beloved heartbeat in sync with yours my teacher. With a swift move there is a shift to mindfulness, the here and now invoked by the burn, the heat of my abdominals, and I let the breath guide each move and the effort to completion. Breathe deep and let go, feel each corner of my body alive, invigorating, and joyful. I transition to Tend and there it is again the sweetness of the beat but this time the mind is resting, there is no greed, just the desire to connect inwards and tend to my need to rest.

1652.0,"I'm so glad of reading all comments after I completed this session at 11 pm today :P
I was struggling and wondering WHEN DOES THIS END, but I felt really good after I finished. I know I will get my periods in a few days, and I feel really annoyed about this. It may seem like nothing, but I always feel weakened, I may have to stop the projects I'm doing, sometimes it's preventing me from starting a sports program because I know I will have to pause it during the month and it's not motivating. Maybe I'll also have to stop the Yoga as well, but I would like to give it a try. My periods make me feel like I'm weak, I'm forced to take a break I don't always want, to stay in bed and feel low in energy when I'd like to go things. But you said ""notice how it feels like to be alive today"", and strangely it made me feel empower instead. I know I'll have my periods in a few days, but I'M ALIVE, right?
They cannot take ""that"" away from me. I might feel weak, tired, or anything, but I'm still alive. I don't know why exactly but I feel relieved and more ""accepting"" now. At the end, I've got the power

1768.0,"Day 6:

HAH.  To heck with procrastinating, avoidance, fear, or giving into yesterday being hard.  I showed up and I did it.  So there.

I actually did pre-watch today's session before doing it, as suggested in the comments yesterday, and oh my gosh it helped so much?  Today was still HARD, but that's because the poses themselves were hard, not because I was all caught up in my head trying to figure them out while also laying on the floor and not able to see the screen.  Score one for excellent advice from strangers on the internet.

The low boat/high boat expansion and contraction was rough because my core literally, physically cannot do what Adriene does there, and it's not an easy one to quickly notice a good modification to.  I can sink down into the 'low boat', but then I absolutely CAN'T get back up to the center.  The good lesson there, though, was realizing I could set myself up for better success by not sinking down nearly so far to begin with.  Sure, my 'low boat' turned out to be more like a medium boat at high tide, but I still got a little dip and it was still high enough that I COULD complete the effort and come back to center once I'd done it.  Which means I win, because I figured out what I needed and did it.

I'm going to HURT tomorrow, but I feel a lot better now than I did at the end of yesterday, so go me.",UgyWVakgOQeoXhR33qN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-07T21:27:30Z,-0.7977644205093384

1840.0,The last two days have been hard. Yesterday feeling mentally overwhelmed with lockdown and home schooling and today just unwell and unhappy. I opened YouTube and saw ‘burn’ and my mind went back to ‘back in the day Adriene’ with the tough workouts! I think I was mentally hoping for ‘ease’ or ‘reflect’ or something but then I heard ‘do not be afraid!’ And I sat down and just gave it a go and ok I paused a time or two but made it through and felt a sense of achievement and happiness.

1843.0,"Ok, I never thought I'd say this: I LOVED DAY 6! I LOVED THE BURN!
After a couple of years in the YWA community, I didn't have to check the calendar or the email to know what today is gonna be. I dreaded, hated, worried about day 6 in the past, but now I just love the confidence core work gives me. 
Accepting my belly, giving it the attention it deserves with binds and twists as well as hardcore strength building has been one of the biggest changes in my relationship with my body since starting yoga. You expect to become bendier, better balanced and stronger, but what I didn't expect is the love and gratitude I feel for my body now.
To everyone struggling today: keep up the good work! If it's burning, it's working ;) 
To everyone in doubt if to do the video: DO IT! It might just be the tiny spark you need to light that fire. To burn that bridge. To ignite that flame.

Every time a practice contain core workout I always dread not the planks or the boat poses but the poses where you have to lift your head from the ground. The burn in my abdomen is hardly noticeable from all the shaking of my neck - throughout my yoga journey I've struggled with lots of different poses and lots of muscle group I barely knew I had, but the neck muscles are the only ones that have brought me close to tears with frustration. Does anyone else struggle with strength in the neck? But I'm sure if I remain positive and patient with myself I'll build up that strength bit by bit.

Doing yoga on this channel has helped me so much, I'm still anxious because I feeel I can't do it and I'll be left feeling frustrated and hurting, but it's never really anything I can't take. And bit by bit I see myself getting stronger. As we did the twisted low boats today I realised how far I've come since half a year ago!
I'm especially proud of myself since I've spent a good portion of the day shoveling snow and was worried I wouldn't have the strength. But seeing it all cleared up and having done this practice – and actually having fun with touching the toes to the ground! –I feel a true sense of accomplishment!

I'm afraid when it began with working core and abdominals I did it ""my way"" because my muscles are not strong enough for it and I start to breathe really creatively😝 so I'm happy and feel good because I didn't quit but a little disappointed because I knew the power of my muscles butt it became very real in action (not sure it make sense) anyway I know if I continue I'll feel good and will become stronger so I keep gratefull and hopeful 
This was a really good day 
Thanks again for this peace new to me and myself

2396.0,"As tough as all the core work was in this one (and I did have to take a couple breaks...) the hardest post for me in the whole practice - something I always find the hardest pose - was the child's pose.

I have a bit of a belly on me, especially after the last few months of lockdowns, and when I try going into child's pose, my torso feels so restricted my body immediately starts to panic, and tries gasping for air, and I have to come out of childs pose, out of pure fight-or-flight adrenaline. I always modify to extended childs pose with my legs wide so I can breathe.

Just a funny experience I thought I'd share in case anyone else can relate. As tough as the core workout may be, that's just tiring, but feeling that spike of panic in what is supposed to be a relaxation pose is... something I want to avoid until I can gradually get into it without that experience!!",UgyzaFn9ngNNcKaA6094AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-07T14:55:09Z,-0.9913612008094788

I've been practicing with you for a long time now and every time you do this one I am left utterly confused and breathing improperly when I follow your instructions. You are not as skilled at teaching pranayama as you are asana. Breath of fire can be very dangerous for people, particularly new practitioners - which make up the majority of people participating in these 30 day challenges - and you don't even give a disclaimer that it is contraindicated for many. This is an incredibly advanced type of breath and shouldn't be taught in this way.

I did not make it the last three days and didn't feel good in general (mentally). I already felt like I failed... but then I made it to the mat because I remembered that every breath can be a new beginning! The sun came out just as I started todays practice. 
Now I am full of positive energy, motivation and love - going to do two practices three times now! I could really feel the connection to my breath today and none of the exercises were exhausting even though my body was burning.

2746.0,"So... starting with the end: when in cobbler pose, my mind was wandering and I was in full-on ruminating, self-deprecating, frustrated mode because I really couldn't do a couple of poses today, as my body is quite tired, and I simply lacked the strength and energy to lift it. I told myself I was really not fit enough, not strong enough, I had let myself get out of shape, blah blah blah... And then, I remembered today's email and the idea that we need to meet ourselves where we are. So, this is where I am today: I have a lot of room for improvement, and it's going to be challenging to get back in shape and strengthen my core again, but that's a journey I'm willing and eager to take. I will also have a big lunch and try this practice again mid-late afternoon, because I'm sure I can do a little better. Thank you so much for the reminder, Adriene.

My core strength is really bad need to work on that, 2. For some strange reason I find my self holding my breath alot so I have to work on my breathing alot. 3.
