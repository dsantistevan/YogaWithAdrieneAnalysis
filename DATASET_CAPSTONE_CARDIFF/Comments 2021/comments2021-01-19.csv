It frustrated me at first and I was getting annoyed at myself for not paying attention but then I remembered to ""come as you are"" and suddenly my focus changed from chastising my lack of attention to gently recentering on my breath and the sensation of each pose each time I find my mind wandering.

I have had a shoulder impingment problem for 8 years now that physio alone has not been able to correct, but the way yoga addresses the positioning and flexibility of the whole body has started to fix my shoulder impingment.

231.0,"Saying ""the hardest part is showing up"" never resonated with me because doing yoga didn't feel like the hardest part, all the poses did. But since I've been coming off anti depressants (good reasons!), the withdrawal effets are knocking me about so much that turning up has now become the hardest part. I have horrible indigestion, weird zaps, I often feel like my nerves detect the ground a second too late, my limbs feel like fuzzy velvet, and I am fighting bad back pain due to sleeplessness.

Sometimes I miss a day. It's Feb 9th and I'm on day 18 and I started on day one. I try not to think ""I wish she wouldn't congratulate me for being here because it reminds me of the days I wasn't, and she is congratulating people on the days I wasn't here!!"". But I remember to remind myself that this is my journey. Someone else's struggles are not mine to compare to, and I believe it ruins any healing they have done when I (in my mind) think others don't deserve praise for turning up on days I didn't.

I do get frustrated when Adrienne keeps talking, but I remember that I used to love it because it kept yoga fun and inviting, whereas now I just wanna get through it so I can go back to being in regular discomfort. I'm so glad I was reminded today that everyone is different, and I don't get to me impatient because something that is designed to be soothing isn't going at my pace.",UgzJAt1gy4LjgVQ5pUJ4AaABAg,1.0,5.0,2021-02-09T00:13:04Z,-0.986609160900116

Seriously though: I missed a bunch of days in a row for several reasons, and they happened, and they don't matter any more.  What matters is being here on the mat again, and the intention to be back tomorrow.  To always come back, even if there's a gap.  And I've got that.

In other related news, I think I need a literal yoga mat.  While I didn't do great at connecting to center today, I did feel very very firmly in my whole body that finding my center is almost impossible if I don't have a good base to start from--and there is not enough friction on my living room rug to ever feel truly secure in my base.  I CAN do the wide-legged stances and ground into my feet.  I have that strength.  But when I'm using nearly all the strength I have just to press into the ground so I don't instantly slip into a wider splits than my body can handle, there's none left to find center with.  It's a disadvantage I haven't even really paid attention to playing with, and it's HARD.

I haven't done yoga in 5 years and I'm casually flexing on poses that previously tested my soul and sanity, no cap. I have a distinct memory from my childhood when my sister shamed me for breathing too loudly in the theater.  That day I learned to control my breath, but with the malintent of snuffing it out. 20 years later and I'm finally giving myself permission to aspirare. ASPIRE. To Breath. Here's another anecdotal metric: Cold showers used to be a challenge, but knowing how to breath slowly has erased the discomfort of stepping into one; here's lookin' at you, Wim Hof.  Also, since finding my center I can straight up Irish dance having never taken a lesson. It's like that Mulan song: Once you find your center, you are sure to win! All this after 18 days.

562.0,The way you've curated each day is magnificent Adrienne. Admittedly something got on my nerves and threatened to ruin my morning that I had to close my laptop and get on the mat. My mind was distracted up until the Crescent Pose when the lovely feeling of that stretch overrode my annoyance and I could finally centre my self into the practice. It also taught me that the feelings and emotions I centre is through choice and that I need to commit and train my mind to centre my feelings out of negativity.

688.0,"When I started doing yoga about 7 years ago, it was as a way to stretch and recover from running or as a way to gently cross-train for running. I was in it for the workout and didn't really care about looking inward or cultivating the connection of the mind to the body. Since then, I've injured my knee and can no longer run, and I have returned to yoga with a much different approach. At a low point in my health and physical fitness in late November, I started doing the 30-day Yoga Camp series and gained so much direction from each practice and from journaling about the mantras. I ended that series just in time for Breath, and this has been a beautiful journey in slowing down and appreciating inner strength. At a time when thousands of people with covid are struggling to breathe on ventilators and the phrase ""I can't breathe"" is a rallying cry for social justice, the theme of breath is powerful and so, so precious. I really appreciate how I'm learning to move and open up from the inside out, and today's focus on the center may be my favorite practice of this series so far.",UgzMko9BE2xbapPyE354AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-20T02:46:55Z,0.9963477253913879

After that I tried to maintain a home practice, even if that just meant 15-20 minutes on the mat at the end of a workout. Fast forward to last March and the beginning of the pandemic. I was scared. I was freaking out. I came back to YWA. I did the yoga for stress & anxiety video every day. Over and over. I‚Äôd occasionally add another video, like if my low back or shoulders needed some extra attention. Adriene really helped me let go of all that stress and anxiety. It got me through some dark days. Eventually, I grew a bit bored of doing that one video over and over and remembered the 30 day series. Amazingly there were several different 30 day series and I just started working through them at my own pace. Some days I‚Äôd skip, on others I‚Äôd do 2.

P.S: This journey inspired me to get a new mat after 5 years. My mom said I deserved the best one for sticking to yoga so passionately for the past years. <3 It felt so good practising on the new mat today.

897.0,"Today's practice was about learning how to move from the center. Being aware of our center and centering with our breath in every moment, because invites the next moment and the next. In today's practice, I may not have understood some terms she was using, a few words kind of vague to me. Anyway, I was surprised how thinking and being aware of the center can feel different and new. I definitely cannot stay in crow for more than 1 second but I like the challenge. I'll do it one day. 

I feel heavy after the practice, also a little bit of headache of pre-practice might have influenced it. But definitely, I feel more relaxed. 

This is one of Adriene's favorite practices and she invites asking ""What is my relationship to center? What does center feel like? Why is center important?""",Ugwp9ECUlyY52_ex9iR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-19T20:24:17Z,0.9961434006690979

1) Down dog really stirs up congestion in my chest, so I had to take a break to take my inhaler halfway through. 
2) I held my plank for a full 10 seconds today!!! YAY!! 
3) I held the crow pose practice posture a little too long and now my plantar fasciitis is acting up, so that's something I didn't even know I needed to work on.
4) As hard as practices are getting, I'm still coming off the mat feeling accomplished and strong. I'm tired and sweaty, breathing out through my mouth a whole lot during practice (lots of heat to release) and feeling super good about myself. 
5) The amount of fat on my thighs  makes it impossible to keep my feet flush together and straighten my legs, so they are always a little apart. Despite observing that, I don't feel bad about my weight.

So yesterday when I hurt my foot and could barely move it I felt sad knowing that today I might have to miss practice for the first time. I decided to join all of you anyway and do a bunch of variations to protect myself (keeping a knee on the floor during the warriors, doing puppy postures instead of downward facing dogs, doing half planks...) but up from the minute 25:00 onwards I couldn't really do much.
I was feeling a little discouraged until at 28:00 she began to explain how we really are a community and we must be patient with one another.

""...Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. 
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.
We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? 
Actually, who are you not to be? 
You are a child of God.
Your playing small does not serve the world.
There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. 
We are all meant to shine, as children do.
We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. 
It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.
And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.""",UgyzMAUVj5D3G_hTTR14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-19T11:35:42Z,0.9995940327644348

1343.0,"I was really frustrated by crow, not by me not being able to balance on my hands, but because I couldn't get my body in what seemed to be the right position. Her knees looked like they were basically in her armpits and her hands really far forward, the only way for me to get my knees where her knees looked to be was to have my hands in by my feet. I know my arms are slightly shorter than average, so I'm sure that doesn't help, but I felt like my position was all wrong. Didn't help when she said knees shouldn't be digging into the arms, and mine totally were. Frustrating! Anyway, I know the point is to try, not be perfect, but I felt like I wasn't even trying the right way to set up for crow in the future.",UgwKj6a4BirV9CdXtdp4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-19T10:50:56Z,-0.9996223449707031

""My relationship to center"" is to be in the still point, in that space where my true power lies and where no effort is needed. No effort to do any of the yoga poses, no effort to speak my truth, no effort to relate to all around and be part of our beautiful world and all the lovely souls around. Thank you for an amazing practice today. So helpful to now start and think to move from our centre every time we engage into anything inwardly or outwardly. Wishing you all a gorgeous day ahead üåà",Ugxoch3YUuA50b3aFPV4AaABAg,0.0,3.0,2021-01-19T07:33:53Z,0.998369038105011

I‚Äôm quite short (1,59) and I find the crow pose very difficult because it feels like my arms are too short to be a support for my legs. Can someone else relate to that or is it just me? Or is it just because I can‚Äôt connect with my center properly? Thanks again for the practice Adriene.
