283.0,I am happy I joined the 30 day journey! I made the commitment so I can get back into yoga for being away from it for awhile due to depression and anxiety. Some days were a struggle just to get on the mat and some days i missed altogether. If I missed a day i would combine them the following day. I am happy I did this because it's getting me out of the darkness and into the light. Thank you Adrienne & Benji! :),UgzC4g1P-QDSMZFU-Vl4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-31T19:46:03Z,0.9994934797286987

And, the payoff during non yoga as been beneficial as well. I even believe my breathing while asleep has improved. I thank you for your loving kindness and look forward to continuing this journey.

322.0,"Adriene, there are times in your life when you just feel like something is missing. Yoga was my missing link that has over-time brought me closer to my center and to myself. Your yoga lessons of self-love resonates. I started practicing yoga back in September, after coming home from a trip. I noticed the weight I had gained and in my eyes I could tell there was a lack of self confidence and unhappiness. I was disconnected with myself. I thought why not, I have this yoga mat from high school that I haven't touched in 9 years. I decided to dedicate myself to yoga every single day to see what happens. Now, I feel like I am incomplete without doing yoga every day. Even if it's just 15 minutes, the breathing alone is beneficial. You've made me laugh and have kept my spirits up with your wisdom and warmth you bring. Thank you for helping me find my confidence and self-love. Sidenote: I've lost 26 pounds since I started too so I feel much healthier and it even has changed the way I think and my perception in a positive way. I truly do believe in the benefits from practicing yoga. Thank you so much Adriene and Benji! üíôüíô I hope I can meet you one day and tell you in person how much you've saved my life.

402.0,"Wow. Today was a big one for me. I was a bit behind so I did Day 28's practice immediately before this one. It was good timing, because I was having a rough day (was rather irritated), and needed something to help me constructively work through it. Within the first ten minutes of this one I was bawling. I had been having thoughts of having some comfort food after this practice (it is dinner time), right before the tears came. Just like for so many of us, the last year was rough. I put on some extra pounds because I was emotionally eating so much. I've been trying to get back into shape and eat better, but it's been hard to shed the weight though I feel healthier. It's tricky to walk the line of being motivated to keep going, and not be hard on yourself. I realized as I was crying, that I was letting out some of that emotion that I had been stuffing down with food this year. I was grateful to have the space to let it flow. It was a good incentive that I may need to do an hour of yoga next time I'm in an emotional eating mood.

Eventually it passed, and then as we were touching our opposite shoulder while in plank, I was amazed at how strong I was! Steady I tell ya! Never would have imagined that at the beginning. We've come a long way this month (and year), and I'm not going to stop now.

I suffer from a bit of asthma and when we first started the breathing on our backs, with our hands to our belly and hearts, I struggled with the deep breathing.  This happens particularly when breathing out sometimes when lying on my back and I couldn't take a deep breath without coughing or wanting to cough.   So in the end, after this practice of working the body, and coming into the same pose we started with, lying on our backs with hands to belly and heart, I noticed after several breaths how clear my breathing was, how absolutely clear and taking beautiful deep breaths.

I was confused though. My muscle grew so much! but when I tried to lift some heavy stuff the other day,  it seemed more difficult than usual. Then I realised: The muscles that grew the most art the ones that help me 'push'.  Like pushing off the ground into plank and pushing to get into crow.

565.0,"Dear Adriene,

I am leaving my mat in tears today.
In March/Apr√≠l, I was doing Home with you. We were locked in quarantine in the Czech republic back then. I was practicing Home with my best friend, also doing some wim hof practices, walking up an old Celtic pagan hill in my neighbourhood. I was joking all the time that what I was doing felt like magic. That I have no idea where its going to take me. I have done Yoga before, I have been doing it since on and off as well, but that time felt different.
Well, the next month after Home, they called me from the social services. They had a baby boy for me to adopt. To take home.

Fast forward, here I am, with him at home already for so many months, finalising my court application to have it all done. I had to do so much paperwork, not to freak out so much. I felt like I was going to go crazy.
I needed so much breath. You gave me all of it.
The application is sent, accepted, the only thing I am waiting for is the final court date. 
Maybe some small changed will happen too, but I am a peaceful warrior.

You have the biggest Namaste from me. Ever.",Ugw9SMkbhaeRNioGGQN4AaABAg,2.0,1.0,2021-01-30T19:59:31Z,0.9545277953147888

We‚Äôre also both members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and we have found that yoga is such a great metaphor for our spiritual growth trying to follow Jesus Christ. This practice has made us better at living out our religion and being kind with ourselves and others while also challenging ourselves. It continues to be awesome to learn to care for others by caring the different parts of our bodies and minds.

807.0,"I found Yoga with Adrianne several years ago and she is the one that has inspired me to really get into my daily practice. For years I WANTED to do yoga but at the time was too focused on the hardcore, fast pace, push your body to the limit and feel it for a week at a time type of movement. Honestly at the time I really didn't respect my body, I just wanted to acceive that perfect shape.

But I finally came into yoga, and truely surrendered to it when I was going through some tough times in my life about 3-4 years ago and it honestly has brought me home to myself. Instead of seeing my body as something I have to fight with to get it to do what I want it to do, I see it as an outward reflection of what is going on inside myself. It is mearly a part of me (body/mind/spirit) and all areas have to be harmonious to bring you well being.

For the last 2 years I have pretty well practiced yoga DAILY and I LOVE it! I truely crave it. Without having any expectations of how hard I have to work or how flexible i need to get or how many calories I need to burn. I just get on the mat and move and LISTEN! It is like therapy for me. 

So thank you for being the catalyst to me truely LOVING myself enough to just BE with myself every day Adrienne! It truly is a gift! ü•∞üôèü§óüôèüíñ",UgwwusiNSGecE8kL_rh4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2021-01-30T14:16:54Z,0.9994754195213318

My eyesight is really bad and every practice I would do with my glasses on, which sometimes could get very frustrating (glasses dangling on my nose, falling down). I never considered taking them off because I always wanted to see the video clearly, be able to recreate every move as much as I could. Yesterday for the first time I decided to take my glasses off for the entire practice and see what happens. It was a bit weird but also so much easier! Today I entered the practice without my glasses consciously and decided to fully focus on the voice. I left my perfectionism behind and for the first time during the challenge I listened to my body without any distractions. And like the practice told me to believe, I finally did so.

981.0,"What a wonderful month. I'm very much looking forward to continuing with yoga, hopefully every day.
I do have a request for a bit of advice from the more experienced out there. My wrists really hurt during practice. I really try to push my weight into my fingers when in downward dog but sometimes it hurts so much that I have to drop my knees. Are there any exercises or yoga moves I can concentrate on to build my strength?
I also really struggle with upper arm strength. I used to go to the gym regularly (when we could) and have progressed quite well with deadlifts, but I still can't even bench press the bar without any weight added. I can't do a push up either. I'm quite a big girl (around 95kg) so it's a lot of weight to hold. Any exercises or moves I can concentrate on to increase my arm strength? Maybe more lowering down from plank, or the shoulder taps we did today?",UgwZACwpMDqSnCM_J5t4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-30T09:53:58Z,-0.9880270957946777
