Not at myself; not at the practice.  It was hard.  I noted it, and I dealt with it--I breathed in, I paused the video, I tried it and then tried it again, and I did something that worked, mostly, more or less.  It was pretty far from perfect.  I'm not upset about that fact.

412.0,"Adrienne, I have to thank you for the gift of this journey! This month has been exceptionally challenging for me. Following you through this journey, discovering the power of focused breathing, has helped me navigate my personal storm almost daily. Yesterday I was in the dentist‚Äôs chair for three hours. As he was drilling away in the back of my mouth, I focused on my breath. I counted in for 8, out for 8. I repeated the mantra: my anchor is my breath, my breath is my anchor.‚Äù I focused on breathing down into my torso, and up and out, visualizing the circle or cycle of my breath. I reminded my self to relax the muscles of my face. I focused on lifting through the front body and grounding through the back body. All of this while the dentist worked on grinding my tooth away. When I lost focus, I forgave myself and re-focused. 
You have taught me all of this! My dentist was amazed and thanked me for being such a good patient! ü•∞ I think I will repeat this journey through February! Many, many thanks!!

I did it with my dog and partner pretty late in the day and we all had low energy... and the giggles. I ended up laughing, falling onto my mat and my dog, and just listening to the last third or so of the session while I cuddled up with my dog, Jamie. As I listened, I realized, ""This is yoga, too. Letting your body do what it needs to. Releasing. Falling. Laughing."" Even though I wasn't ""doing the poses"" with Adriene, I was listening to my body - not out of laziness or complacency - but out of delight and truth.  Gotta love yoga. Sending love to you all!

I was telling myself to quit because I'm already so late and that I can't keep up, but then I thought ""so what if i missed a couple of days? it's not the end of the world"" and thankfully I decided to continue practicing. Yesterday I did two practices and today as well, and I'll keep trying my best. Even though I'm a little bit sad but the good thing is that I've learned that Yoga is not a task that I have to check at the end of the day, it is the journey itself.

997.0,"After over a year of daily yoga, and my 3rd year doing all the January journey in January, whilst gradually increasing how much yoga I did until I made it a daily habit I can see how far I've come with some poses!

 Some I used to try then have to sit out or heavily modify. I still have a long way to go but I can see how far I've come, I'm much stronger, more flexible in good ways (I have EDS so I have to be careful not to overextend) and my pain seems to be improved. When I was in my early 20s I would struggle with the pain I felt in mornings climbing just a few steps to my uni studio space, now on good days I can manage it up the 5 flights of stairs to get to my flat and mostly just be out of breath with less pain than those few steps before.  

I take so much joy that one I've warmed up a bit I can now get my feet flat whilst doing a downward dog, such a simple thing, and boats are (usually) now my friend and I can do side planks the whole time without collapsing. I hope this year I can finally get arm balances, little by little I'll work my way to crow! üí™

Thank you for sharing yoga with us Adriene, for being our friend (along with Benji) on the mat and cheering us on. Thank you for reminding us how to breathe with this journey, improved breathing is something I'm taking off the mat as well and am feeling so much better for it.

I won't go into details as I don't want to trigger anyone, but I'll just say that after an agitated night, and being mostly fine this morning, I was doing ok-ish until the Wild Thing pose. I then stopped and waited until forward fold. I went on with the practice until the panic attack was too intense to even hear what you were saying. I stayed in Savasana until it passed, letting it wash away and starting to breathe deeply again. Not too much else to say about this practice, but I'll obviously try again another time.
