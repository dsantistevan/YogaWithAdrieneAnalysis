3.0,"the ujjayi breathing helps me SO much, i’m not really sure how to explain it. it feels so good and makes me feel more connected with both my movements and my stillness. i guess its, like i think you sort of said, making it easier to calm my mind. breathing fully, consciously, and consistently is usually a struggle for me, as someone who both has anxiety and is a former smoker who hasn’t been able to get out much in a pandemic (especially over the intense winters here). thank you so much for introducing it, i can’t wait to see how it evolves for me! sending my love to you and benji.",UgxIZHIZDp7255aS_6x4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-07T19:05:24Z,0.9991232752799988

18.0,"This practice came on the perfect day for me, which is even more amazing in light of the fact that I missed my practice yesterday so I was technically ""behind"". Before Adriene had begun speaking about the mind wandering and having emotions on the mat in the beginning I had already gotten to a place where I was crying from the buildup of so much anxiety and unknowns that have been happening in my life this past week, and hearing her express those words was so encouraging and applicable in that moment. The Ujjayi breath was so grounding, and when it came to the mantra in mountain pose I was able to personalize it to ""My God is my Anchor, my Anchor is my God"", thinking of Hebrews 6:19, which was so encouraging for me as I have been having a hard time trusting God in the midst of all of the unknowns. But He really is in control, He really is my Anchor, and He cares so much for me personally to remind me of these truths in the middle of my normal routine.

49.0,"Hi Adriene

Really loving all this beautiful breath work! Thank you!  I felt disappointed at the end that you did not emphasize the importance of shivasana as an integrating pose onto itself. I also do understand that many participants leave before the end but others like me want to stay in shivasana longer. This was however not possible as the music at the end was not long enough and a rude and loud add started playing which made getting out of shivasana very abrupt. Could I simply ask that music be lengthened to reflect a true shivasana? Much appreciated...namaste...",Ugwe2dEi83-3_zdgEm54AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-09-22T15:33:05Z,-0.9674751162528992

I think this is because I have difficulty doing downward dog, I am not sure yet why. But I kept going and finished.
I liked doing the warrior poses. Are they supposed to be hard? I felt I could do them and I am not a very fit person. 
I also liked learning the breath technique which I will look up more about and try to learn.

186.0,"Day 3 complete, yay! This practice was exactly what I needed today. I am in a period of transition in my life, where my fear of letting people in is slowly slipping away and I am letting go of my past neuroses, negative thoughts, and loneliness. With this new openness and connectedness I am experiencing comes an officious voice of dread that says I will never be good enough for any of it. New experiences and new people are coming into my life, which I am so grateful for, but at the same time it all strikes a familiar fear into my heart and the urge to perform for these people or things, or to cower away from them, often comes to the surface.

Spending this time on the mat, connecting with my breath, feeling the energy flow within me and really paying attention to the nuances within my body, and knowing that others are on a similar, beautiful journey, all helps me to realise the weight of what I've carried throughout my life and what I no longer need to carry.

268.0,"I Keep coming back. It's not just a good workout... the Breath helps me to hear my inner self, my inner life and Spirit.

Today, when Adriene asked us to speak lovingly to ourselves... I felt an overwhelming feeling that it's ok to love yourself, even while I'm so imperfect in so many ways, it's ok to love myself and be kind to myself.

Then... when she talked about the miniscule muscles we're are using with our breath... it reminded me of the lesson on cells I was giving to my kids... how we have trillions of tiny cells composing our body, little universes within my body working hard to give me life and energy... and I felt grateful for all the hard work, all the life, all the joy, all the stretching and reaching in the middle of the opposition of life that my body has given.
And I thought... it's ok to love my body... 
Not like I love my body because of whatever shape it's in(which is fine), but I love it because of everything it gives me and does for me. Constantly.

See. It's not just a physical workout. It's something more. And I'm incredibly grateful for that.",UgyeB7G-EuzVJ1GqVPV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-03-12T16:52:54Z,0.9997574687004089

343.0,"Хотелось бы поделиться своей истории.

Мне всегда казалось, что нужно следить за своим телом, поэтому я старалась заниматься силовыми упражнения. Но это не приносило такого уж удовольствия. Результаты, конечно, были, но для чего, если процесс был не из любимых. 
Совсем недавно, в декабре 2020 ночью, увидела видео как йога изменила мою жизнь или как я делала её год. под видео советовали этот канал. так что я недолго думала и решила следующим же утром начать практику. и я ни разу не пожалела о свое решение. 

это то, что мне подходит, здесь есть нагрузка и есть растяжка, но самое главное, есть связь со своими ощущениями, чувствами, телом, эмоциями. есть ощущение настоящего. 

это моя вторая 30 дневная йога, и после этой сессии так хорошо. особенно позвоночнику и мне, спасибо, что делаете нас здоровыми и счастливыми <3",Ugxfi3qC7ekQjh5dIkB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-17T08:33:51Z,-0.38355460980324574

He eventually moved on seeing i was too busy and could only give him distracted pats. By the time I was in child's pose, I was almost in tears. It's been a heavy week and this grounding and anchoring session lifted so much from my chest and I'm so thankful.

843.0,"Thank you, thank you, thank you Adriene!!! I am on a healing journey, have been for about 5 or so years. I was relinquished for adoption at birth. This trauma and the subsequent trauma of being placed into a new and different family impacted me spiritually, physically, and emotionally. My body has stored that trauma until now. My adoptive parents chose to not tell me about being adopted because they said I was a very sensitive child. They had 2 biological children right after I was placed with them. They did not wish for me to feel less loved and wanted than my brother and my sister. But even though I did not have the knowledge of my relinquishment or my adoption, my body knew.  A confusing place to be for sure. At 20 years old I accidentally found out that I was adopted. The impact of this knowledge is difficult to describe. Honestly, for the next 25 years I think I was in shock from this new information about myself and my reality. Denial is a powerful thing, it was my native language. Anyway, recently I have been working with a somatic experience therapist trying to learn how to be more ""in my body."" I was completely disconnected from my body, my feelings, and my self. She is an incredibly gifted therapist and has helped me tremendously in learning how to experience my feelings that I have always up until about 5 years ago kept numb because I did not think I could feel them and survive. SE therapy and yoga (with breath work and mindfulness) have changed my life. As an adoptee, being in my body has always felt unsafe. I am slowly learning how and experiencing being grounded and growing in feeling safe. The slow, gentle, patient, and endearing way that you lead yoga is enabling me to actually feel relaxed in my body. Hyper-vigilance is one more gift that my relinquishment gave to me. I have tried so many different ways to not hold my breath and my body so tense, but I have had no success until yoga. But who you are and how you speak and what you draw attention to is like magic. It truly is a balm and an aide assisting my body to not hold the tension. Thank you.",Ugz19n6ZDhI9ge24Vg14AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-07T06:49:53Z,0.9871600866317749

916.0,"Today's anchoring meant to reach my thoughts to the breath every moment, like acknowledging it. Also introduced Ujjayi breath, deep breathing with lips closed, which the sound of exhaling is like the sound of the ocean. Today's practice had many Warrior 1 and 2 poses and many plank poses and downward dog right after another which made it very difficult at the end on my arms, legs, and thighs but managed to do them all. 
The mantra of today was my breath is my anchor, my anchor is breath.

I couldn’t do Downward Dog on Day 1. Today I managed Downward Dog, and both Warrior 1 & 2. Thank you, Adriene.",UgwVisxYpFt_IJ2dDWp4AaABAg,7.0,253.0,2021-01-05T13:47:33Z,0.9527312517166138

1099.0,"Namaste Adriene! I feel so happy to have learned this new Ujjayi breath from you. At first, I felt that I could not get it, but I kept practising. Also, I watched your recommended video to learn more before today’s class, which helped (practise before practise, lol). 

My Ujjayi breath with my mouth closed was quite exaggerated, and I made all kinds of odd sounds, including a gurgling sound in the back of my throat. Then, I realized that maybe I was trying too hard (a usual problem for me, along with forgetting to breath). So my breath became a whisper soft form of Ha, of the way that I did it with my mouth open. I felt so gently happy with this outcome. 😊 

I also found your visual of my breath fogging up a window when my mouth was open, with a heart drawn on the glass, to be so appealing. It became a good visual image and memory cue for me, for how I could make it happen again, once I caught on. So I mentally repeated this, a few times. 

Also, it was a great challenge for me, to sync up the breath with movement. So in order to keep my focus on new breath going as much as possible, I found that I need to do the movements very gentle today. Which was good as I am sore and tired. I also incorporated many mods, inspired by all the wonderful modification advice, kindly posted by people who took yesterday’s class. Namaste all!

1340.0,"As always, thank you for this lovely practice. For anyone like me who has asthma, Ujjayi breath can be a little helpful at slowing and potentially preventing an oncoming asthma attack when it's triggered by activity. When I hike, I always make sure I have my inhaler handy (as you should too!) -- but I have noticed that if I start to struggle with breath on a steep incline, I can stop and often calm my lungs down until I can get a full breath again, using Ujjayi breath. Something to try and see if it helps you too. (Obviously, you know your own asthma and if you are past the point of no return, use the inhaler or get help! But using this technique may help you, as it's helped me, to reduce my inhaler needs.)",UgwbHs1eCe0jYgUMoGF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-05T01:16:19Z,0.954906165599823

1502.0,"During day 1 and 2, I found it difficult for me to really take deep breaths and focus on my movement and breath, because I've been going through a lot of anxiety and OCD and my mind couldn't help but wander into dark places, no matter how hard I tried to focus on the practice. When breathing in, it felt like I was stuck at a certain point, as if my body or mind didn't allow me to breathe in any further. Today I still had troubling thoughts but felt much lighter when stepping onto the mat. I really loved that we were practicing ocean breath today because it was new to me and I focused on it much more. I smiled a lot throughout the practice. By the end of the video,  I was able to take the longest breath I've taken for quite some time now, I think. I was surprised how I wasn't stuck at a certain point and instead really felt the air I was soaking in through my entire body. It felt like the biggest physical relieve after days of battling my anxious and intrusive thoughts. I feel so light now, Adriene.

And this one actually ended up feeling short cause I was so concentrated and just really in the ZONE with the breath !

This one was spot on and just what I needed to tell my mind we got this, even when my body is screaming no we dont 😉 I can do this!!!! 
And also it really is something to check numbers when I start video and again when I'm done. LOVE the idea that I just did this with 20,000 others around the world!

1902.0,To all the mommas doing this with little ones running all around them. Invite them to join you if they will! Teach them about calming breathes and how important it is to connect. And for the little ones who don’t have long attention spans (mine 🤣🤣) make a busy box that you just bring out during yoga sessions. Put fun little activities in it! Give them a snack and make sure their drinking cups are full.

1991.0,"Day 3: oh, this one felt GOOD.

I had to stop and start three different times during the first eight minutes of practice because of other things going on, and even as I was finally settling in, I found myself wondering, am I going to manage to keep focus at all?  And then I started picturing the ocean.
Keeping focus is SO HARD for me with yoga sometimes!  I can take my body through the movements, but being present in the moment is so difficult.  But today, I found myself visualizing some combination of every beach I've ever visited in my life, the swell of waves up and down, for the whole practice.  Sometimes I was still as a rock with the waves crashing around me.  Sometimes I was laying on the beach listening.  Sometimes I was the water.  But it WORKED.  I was here with the practice rather than off in my head churning over anxieties or other things, not distracting myself by focusing too much on Trying To Focus.  Things flowed together.  I didn't keep getting messed up because Adriene's breathing rhythm was slightly different than my own, because it was easy to picture the ocean just changing tempo a little and flowing with it.  I kept plank pose way easier than usual (way longer than yesterday!) because I wasn't concentrating on trying SO HARD to keep all my muscles in place, I was just being a steady pier surrounded by water.

Heck.  If I can keep remembering this technique, I think I can DO this.",UgxQaco3M4DoGCoEvPF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-04T17:10:26Z,0.9868980646133423

2050.0,"So... I have this anxiety when it comes to audible breath. I think it started when I was a kid and I was a mouth breather LOL. My anxiety got worse  when I went into theatre school and all we did for the first year was focus on the breath. Theatre school was a competitive environment and I would constantly perform with my breath, because well... it was theatre school. Anywho! What Adriene said about the Ocean Breath not about performing, it really resonated with me. I find that I perform for others and myself a bunch. So to allow myself to find this time to let that go was so satisfying, albeit scary. Thank you for this wonderful day three.

2055.0,"Hey Adriene, 

Long time viewer of yours but recently something has been brought to my attention. Yoga being “taught” by white people is cultural appropriation. I’m ashamed to say that I wasn’t aware of this until today and I haven’t been able to put my phone down since I came to this realization because I am having one consistent thought continuously swirling around in my mind “how did I not know this sooner.” My phone is no longer being used today for social media, calls, or texts, I’m using my phone today to start on my research journey of yoga and cultural appropriation specifically, in the United States. I encourage you to do some thinking and research on this topic yourself being that you have such a large platform with SO many viewers and subscribers. I am concerned that your not aware of this and I hope I can raise awareness by typing out this comment to you. It’s my job as a white person to raise awareness to other white people...it’s your job as well.

2652.0,"Adriene I love using the Ujjayi breath, it’s something I use often to focus on my practice or even in bed to get to sleep, counting 5 in, pausing, then 7 out, better than counting sheep 😂. I notice as we go through Day 3, we are slowly building on the previous days, adding a little more and gaining strength. As we flow through those vinyasas, I think it’s perfectly ok for us senior yogis and maybe some less able, to use elbows and knees to help us transition through. I made it fine and my cobras are improving. Instead of feeling hopeless it makes me feel positive and satisfied. Early days, but we can do this, each day an adventure.

2773.0,"Getting on the mat was a bit of a struggle today. And half way through the practice I felt like getting into to child's pose and cover myself with a blanket. I did, but came out of it after a few breaths to continue the practice. It's a fine line between finding what feels good (child's pose all the way haha) and motivating yourself to keep going and take the challenge. 
Normally I feel really happy and energized after the practice, can't really say that today. But hey, at least I've done it and tomorrow is a new day and a new chance to enjoy a practice.

2798.0,"The first day was pretty challenging for me. I was having a really hard time synchronizing my breath to my movements and also to the video (I think because of my asthma; my lungs felt constantly full so my inhales were too short and my exhales were too long; so my mouvement was always shifted from the rhythm of the video, which I know I'm not bound to following but it was still very unsettling). Yesterday was a little better but I still felt really frustrated because I couldn't do the entire practice (tight schedule). Today, however was great. Ujjayi breath is a great great tool that I haven't had the occasion to really dive into (pun intended) despite the fact that I'm not so new to the practice (good reminder of how we always, always have something to learn). 
Anyways! This was long! Thank you for your time if you've read this far. 
Thank you Adriene for this yummy practice. I'm really feeling like I'm tuning in with my breath a little more already. Thank you so much.
