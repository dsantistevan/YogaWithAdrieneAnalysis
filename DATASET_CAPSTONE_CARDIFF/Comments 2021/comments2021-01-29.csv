42.0,"today I had to give some blood for analysis; this was the first time I went through this (the blood was from a vein). I was really nervous and although everything went well and there were no consequences, I doubted whether I should have shown today. but I got too attached to yoga, so I took a chance.
I had to use all the easy ways to perform the movements, and it was still very difficult for me by the end - although I know that on another day I would have been more productive. but the hardest thing was to admit that today I will have to move the smallest steps that are possible. trust for me in today's practice is trust in the voice that asked me to take care of myself today and not run forward.
maybe I wouldn't have listened earlier. but today I decided to choose trust. and it suddenly became no less difficult decision than overcoming difficulties in training.
the next two days will not be easy either; I am a little sad that I will be less productive, but I want to find a balance - between movement and taking care of myself. please listen to your voice - sometimes it will be different from the slogan ""better, faster, stronger"", but this does not mean that it is wrong and stupid. sometimes the best step forward is a step back (or at least staying in place).
thank you for this practice and the opportunity to share feelings here. (and I'm sorry for the possible mistakes, English is not my first language). have a great day and take care of yourself in your own way!",UgzRB9kf25g-u5dS1C54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-08-13T19:25:22Z,0.6537203788757324

161.0,"Hi! I would just like to thank you. Last year around this time I first found your practises. I used to be a person who hated moving but I fell in love with you immediately. It helped me to calm myself and find what I actually want to be doing with my life. I slowly started working out as well and now that lazy person from last year loves moving, getting stronger, getting fitter. And even though I don't do yoga as often anymore, it was still something that helped me at the beggining which is always the hardest part. And everytime I find the time and come back to your practise I feel peace and love and I finally trust myself. I'll be thanking you for the rest of my life for that.

311.0,"Hi! So on day 27 Adrienne said “ Try not to look down.” The floor is there and you know it is there. Today whilst out hiking on quite a bumpy trail I heard those words-‘ don’t look down” and I had been looking down trying to place each footstep in a perfect spot in order to avoid twisting my ankle or worse. And my neck was sore form looking down and I wanted to look up instead of looking down. And so I did - look up. And I continued to walk look straight ahead and interestingly I became aware of so many of my senses giving me information about how to keep walking unafraid. My peripheral vision, my proprioception, and even the nerves in my feet all gave me information once I ‘trusted’. The next 5 km of my hike on that bumpy trail rendered my a complete change of attitude and I  looked up ahead the entire time. I get the phrase Adrienne uses, Trust yourself.",Ugy3JJtofDKqeePep_J4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-31T23:57:47Z,0.9873478412628174

I love that there is no music playing. Just silence or her encouraging, inspiring, wise--and sometimes silly--words.  I was slow to get into at first and would sometimes go more than a week before trying another video.   But now it's become a very important part of my life, helping me find equanimity, and I do the videos a few times a week.  Sometimes if I don't have time to put on a video, I just plop down on the floor and do some poses randomly during my day.  It's hard to describe how and why this is so beneficial.  As a younger person I thought yoga was a waste of time when I could be doing cardio or weights.  But, I get it now, and I'm thankful to Adriene for her unique ability to make this feel accessible and worthwhile to so many, including me.  :)  PS--her green soup recipe is great if you haven't tried it.",UgzEoATTjYgsTfEkZLx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-29T22:47:04Z,0.9985460042953491

I still wasn't in the mood for doing yoga, especially a 36-minute-long video, but I needed to do at least a few stretches. So I pressed play and made it to the end.

Sometimes, in the balancing poses, my right foot tenses up so much that it starts cramping, so I had to rewind the video and try once more, slowing it down, not even attempting the dancer pose but just listening to what my body feels and does when I stand with one leg lifted. But I think I got a step closer to figuring it out, and that's already a lot. And I even had a little 'hey-o!' moment with myself at the end when Adriene said to open the legs out wide.

I do believe it's true and I'm really thankful to you for the reminder. As for the practice, it got a bit challenging at times and I couldn't do everything, but there were a couple of occasions where I was tempted to give up but stuck with it, and that was another proof that I am stronger than I often think I am.

By the time I got to my mat I was so frustrated with myself for “ruining” the start of my day but once I got on my mat I told myself “let’s reset” and then all of the things Adriene said today “you are exactly where you’re supposed to be” etc really helped. Yes, this practice was challenging but did I do it? Yes!!! I’m exactly where I need to be and I have the power to change my outlook on my day, it’s not ruined!
