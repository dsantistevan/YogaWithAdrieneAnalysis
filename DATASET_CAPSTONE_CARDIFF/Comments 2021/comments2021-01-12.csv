And it's cool to notice that I can actually keep up with the breathing rhythm as well - in the past I had to constantly take additional breaths.

38.0,"This practice is transforming my life. Thank you, Adriene, for being such a loving and gentle guide to calm and balance for so many of us. I can confidently say, before I tried yoga a couple of months ago, I just felt like I couldn't catch up with life—the postpartum depression was getting out of hand. Now, despite being sick and injured on and off for months, I feel so much more in-sync. Coupled with a couple of other healthy habits and changes I've made (including using these times to connect with Holy Spirit and the power flowing in and through each one of us—Jesus!), yoga has been an integral key to consistent calm and joy as I take on my day-to-day. I'm happy to say, I positively look forward to each practice because I KNOW I will feel great and my entire day will be transformed by the balance and mental calm I experience every time, without fail! Even the mundane, difficult, or previously stress-inducing tasks become mellowed and my approach can be even and peaceful while facing them.

The strong flow, with the three legged dog bringing the knees forward. That was one of my favourites sequences when I did regular yoga with Adriene.

I even threw in a quick Crow at the end, but it didn't really fly. All in good time. I'll get there again.

It really means a lot that you're supporting and hearing our story when no one has time for one another these days.

So just wanted to say that I AM HEAR FOR YOU no matter who you are and what you're struggling with. I choose to be open and let others in. When you can be open and be present today, someone surely is going to show up and be there for you, if you can let others in and allow yourself to be open you will then begin to actually accept yourself as you are and let go of people and things that don't serve you anymore.

879.0,"Hi there!  I love the classes, Adriene -- they've gotten me through a very long lockdown in France -- since Spring 2020, basically.  But I like to do an hour a day of yoga, so am always searching to cobble together some sort of 1 hour lesson, or a bit more.  I know you are busy, so perhaps time does not permit you to film so much, but if there is time, could you at least film some 40 minute classes?  The little 20 minutes, for me, at least, does not go a long way.  If you filmed more 40-minute sessions, we only have to look for a 20-minute class to make the hour.  Sorry if this request is too annoying.  I really enjoy your personality, Benji and the classes -- just longer ones.  But I bet you have a lot of things to do that we ""little people"" don't know about -- so, if you have time...thanks!",UgwS7td3Gco2tD0-CrR4AaABAg,1.0,0.0,2021-01-12T21:48:46Z,-0.96310955286026

1048.0,"Never thought I’d say it Adriene lol, but the knee to nose, right arm and now left arm aren’t difficult for me anymore. I’m not sure if that is thanks to my strength training program, or I’m now getting to an advanced level in Yoga, but it’s really exciting. I have practiced and studied Yoga now on and off for about 10 years, you have inspired me to get certified, and some day teach! But first I need to get a job in my field (IT), find a teaching program and then teach! Thank you for teaching us, encouraging us and being with us during this time when some days it feels like all hope is lost. 

It’s not. God gave us an Adriene, and she is built to give, and restore us with her unique Yoga teaching. I love when you joke, or start singing. One day my partner said (while he was in our bedroom), “that doesn’t sound like Yoga in there” (while I was in our living room), and I just giggled. 

I hope you have a great day Adriene! And to everyone reading, keep practicing, I am proof that you can start as a beginner and progress. And that some days even a more advanced yoga practitioner falls, or makes mistakes, we are human too! 

Namaste & May you be happy 🌸

Trust in this journey, my beautiful friends at heart. I know it can be hard sometimes. And even if you feel you've gotten so much stronger, ""better""... There will be some days where it's just hard.

I didn't plan on writing it, but I have to.
I can't really describe how much the BREATH series and all your yoga practices save me and help me reconnect to myself. After every practice I remember what it's like to be truly alive and not anxious and lost by so many things that are so out of our control or even by silly little things. Thank you for being yourself and for making us all feel like we are all one huge family all around the world, along with Benji.
And thank you for showing us that you can come back to yourself, through yoga. All that we need is within us! Proud to be celebrating 4 years with Yoga with Adriene this year. Wishing everyone all the love, health and peace of mind, enjoy the BREATH journey and as Adriene says ""don't forget to take the breath with you off your mat"" fellow yoga friends! ♥

If you're struggling - don't give up! I remember my first 30 days and I missed a couple and ended up with a lot of misplaced self-hatred. You can do it!

Today I started immediately after dinner and surprisingly this didn't affect my practise, however, I have not had enough water today resulting in a headache from the heat generated during today's practice... Lesson learnt.. Priority 1 when entering the office is full my water bottle and set my healthy snack on my desk so they are within reach when I need them. Instead of having an empty bottle of water in the ""I'll get round"" things to do list, in my bag under my desk with the a forgotten container of nuts while my stomach is growling!!
