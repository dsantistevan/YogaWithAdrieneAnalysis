188.0,"I felt so good after this. Centered and relaxed. 

After yoga: the moment I saw that my PC had low battery, I didn't stress and hurry to plug it in as I usually do. I calmly took the charger ... put one end in the PC ... put the other end in the plug. 

I felt good and calm after the practice, but still this really surprised me. That I with awareness could do this action, to plug in my computer, so calmly, with no worry.  That I stopped myself from giving into stress,  my body wanting - and demanding - to stay in this nice calmness that we just build. 

That was a bit of a moment to me .. to really realise what yoga can do to me .. can do for me. To move with gentleness, care and sweetness to myself - not allowing external potential stressfull situations to get to me and sweep me out of my balance, but to stay strong and connected in myself. To put myself (how I feel, how I move, my health) first, rather than giving into external stress. 

Thank you.

After I moved out of it (with the right knee back) my right knee hurt quite bad on the left side of my knee cap. It felt as if I stretched something there too much and rapidly. 
I was seated on a small blanket the whole time, maybe that wasn't the best? And I tried to position my foot the way you did: so rectangular to my leg and on the inner side. Naturally the top of my foot would have touched the earth. Was that maybe the reason?

I laughed and shared ""me too"".  Within seconds, my energy shifted.  I see us both on a journey.  We are both navigating stress.  Let us do so with grace.  We can support each other.   My default when faced with stress at work was to vacillate between the emotions of anger and apathy.  Through this practice I am expanding to a new feeling- curious.

Years later, I'm still doing yoga, changed the life and thinking schemes that led me to anxiety and depression (because, yeah, hyperventilating was not THE problem, but a symptom of something else). I'm not the same person anymore, but my love for yoga just kept growing.

As 2021 began, I decided I would'nt make big plans forward this year, but would work inward instead to get rid of what no longer serves me to definitly heal from this past and from last year's experience.

Today during corpse pose I thought about what what you were saying Adriene, what it means to let go and how I always end up letting go on the mat. Then I realized that in death we do the ultimate letting go and I just found this profound sense of peace in corpse pose that I have never felt before. I struggle with anxiety and Yoga helps me let go of the tense, shallow survival breathing I tend to fall into by surrendering to the breath. Really can't overstate how fruitful this practice has been, being able to reunite with my breath whenever I'm reeling from the dissociative terror that is mental illness is making me more resilient and strong. after doing almost three of these challenges the last few months, my body demands yoga every day and I'm so excited üò≠ü•∫üò§ü•∞",UgzytqxT13Sg3cpwF5h4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-28T14:42:56Z,0.9975014328956604

Today‚Äôs practice was both challenging (at 68 that cheerleader pose made me feel totally lopsided üòÇ).  But everything else was smooth, even the 4 count box breath. What truly amazed me was at the end, sitting, I realized that my hands were gently resting on my knees; my elbows gently kissed my waist; and there wasn‚Äôt one ounce of strain to be there!!! I didn‚Äôt want to undo it!  It was a first that everything was just there without trying!! üôèüèª
