2.0,"What a special, creative and empowering practice! I can tell that Adriene put some extra love into this one. I love the yoga coffee at the beginning, the creative transitions between lunges and planks, the positive affirmations, the weird hip stuff, the tree pose-like balance practice, and catching the falling stars at the end! It's like all of my favorite parts of the yoga wrapped up in one practice. I wonder if she feels that way about this practice as well.

I could not stay up in the end I had to transition to shavasana. This is the firs time that I felt like my muscles are sore from the previous practices. my mid back my legs were so tight and sore. and when you did the side plank my obliques were okay but my wrists hurt so bad. For the first time in 24 days this happened to my wrists. (I ground my hands like a claw it takes a little weight off my wrists but still it hurts so much) I just wanted to share if anyone has tips for me.,UgzMEMs0PUiDW30j5ml4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-05-08T05:00:18Z,-0.9968486428260803

You are such a sweet person, so cute and funny, and your instructions are so direct and clear that I feel like I'm doing yoga with a friend and am super comfortable! I do find I always have trouble with the simple seated positions, my lower and middle back end up in so much pain after just a minute or two, even if I rise my hips up with a block or pillow! I know this probably is related to poor posture, but often it hurts too much to get through even the meditations and breathwork and I worry this is affecting my practice or improvement. Sometimes it hurts so much that I skip the seated work and it bothers me that I do that. Do you have any tips for people who struggle with just sitting??

While the physical changes are quietly palpable (more flexible, loss of belly fat and overall flab), the emotional and psychological changes are roaring - overall more centered and not reactionary; More charitable towards self and others, as in giving the positive benefit of doubt; Mindful eating (was an emotional eater); More playful and most of it all I just feel so beautiful! I can sense the question bubbling as to what next after this week? But I know you have so much to give Adriene! I will only focus on the now.

466.0,"This one is my new favorite! It was like doing a strong and graceful dance. It also felt good to do this in an emotional sense. Last night I had an experience that made me think, like Adriene keeps saying, ‚Äúhow you move matters.‚Äù A guy I have been dating for the last few months broke up with me by text message, with no explanation, which to me seemed disrespectful of the good times we had together, and really offended and hurt me - but it also struck me that I was a bit more objective about it, and not as hurt as I could have been. I really want to connect with others, and have kind interactions, even in crappy times like breakups. In general, it doesn‚Äôt cost anything to treat others with dignity and respect, even if you don‚Äôt want to be with them. There‚Äôs no harm in taking a little extra care to be kind, acknowledging that other people have needs besides myself. How we move matters...also, today after this practice I thought a lot about allowing myself to speak my own truth with firm grace. With strength, but also finding ease...it is nice to find moments where these principles appear outside of doing the physical yoga stuff on the mat (even when experiencing a soccer punch, a demoralizing experience like I did last night). I hope to get better at this by practicing it. Yoga really is a union and I want to continue learning because it is not only great exercise, the principles help me handle life‚Äôs difficulties a little better.",Ugwoq9H7ftdEyg8fvVR4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-01-26T03:25:10Z,0.994941234588623

479.0,"Thank you, Adriene. I was starting to feel an overwhelming amount of anxiety build up this evening just before I was going to get into today's video, could feel myself get pulled into numerous distractions which only increased the anxiety but I couldn't seem to snap out of it...and while that happened, I felt the tug of an emotional downward spiral.  Finally, I was able to pull myself out of that just long enough to officially start the video. It really is the most difficult part, to START. Once I started, it was a safe place, I could breathe again, I could detach from those worries that had been so intense just moments before. Upon completing the video, I'm feeling more centered, less anxiety. The positive self talk you encourage sometimes catches me off guard, especially having experienced what I did prior to this video, wow what a difference that can make to just take 20 minutes to be in a positive space that is grounded in the moment, sprinkled with that loving self talk. I loved the side balance poses - when I first started some form of yoga years ago as part of my physical therapy, that move was impossible for me, and became this huge symbolism of the change that can happen when I put self care/health first, and that I am capable of more than I realize, that I can heal and build/find strength. I was reminded of all of this in a rush of feeling within that moment, and felt that strength, that pride, that trust and love in myself, even as my arms shook. THANK YOU for what you do. So very thankful for the friend that sent me here for this 30-day challenge.",Ugxtd25iw4xngiwtccB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-26T03:02:48Z,0.9980362057685852

When I previewed today's video and saw the side plank, I thought there was no way my arm would be strong enough for this.  And then I did it.  My supporting arm shook, my other arm reached to the ceiling and I spontaneously burst into tears.  Yes, I needed the kick stand to stay there, but never did I ever think I would be capable of this.  A powerful lesson of the mind, I was already sabotaging myself thinking I couldn't do something but my body said 'of course you can' ... and this is the 'magic' that Adriene speaks of, and this is why I keep coming back.

847.0,This is the fourth year that I've started my year with 30 days of yoga.  I think this is my favourite series or maybe it has to do with being in another lock down?   I'm enjoying getting onto the mat each day and feel the movements much more deeply than I ever have.  It's also interesting that I've felt quite emotional at the end of each session. I have no idea why but I'm to the point of tears at the end.   These are strange times.

1046.0,"This is my first ""serious"" commitment to a 30-day challenge and it's full of good and bad. I'm not sure if I'm even doing this right. I don't think I'm feeling the things I'm supposed to be feeling in my body. Of course, I'm sure the extra fat I'm wearing doesn't help. I do feel a bit stronger and everyday movements feel much lighter and easier. However, I do not  physically feel ""lighter"", nor do I look it. I'm still having problems getting into a lunge without A LOT of adjustment and then catch-up to get to the pose. And I think I just did my first side plank! (is that what we did? really? YAY!) One thing I do know...I can't continue with a daily practice. It's just too much - I need a rest day now and then. I started walking regularly a few months ago just to get outside for some sun and fresh air. I walk approx. 2x per week and my pace has improved over time. I think I will begin the weight loss series after this, pacing myself according to what my body is saying to me. At the end of the day, I'm exercising. I'm moving. I'm slowly gaining strength and confidence. Baby steps. Thank you, Adriene ü§ç",UgyeOsLUc3IFG_10KB14AaABAg,19.0,145.0,2021-01-25T11:56:49Z,-0.5509980320930481
