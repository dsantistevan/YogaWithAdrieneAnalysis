11.0,"Hi Adriene, just wanted to pop in to say how grateful I am for your online classes. I did the first 20 days without skipping a beat - although I wasn't sure if I could do so at the beginning. After all, I am a borderline kyphotic scoliotic who tried every play in the book (pilates, swimming, etc.) to improve my posture with no sustained results. I find this 30 days idea so compelling, because it is different everyday and you are an excellent instructor. You are so good at verbal cueing that I don't even have to look at the screen anymore, even though my Yoga experience is very limited. I am seeing the results since day 1, and my posture seems to ""stay"" better even after a long day's work. THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart. 
p.s. I literally cried from joy when I saw that there are several other 30 day challenges on your channel! I can't wait to do everything on this channel :) and will probably sign up to your website, too. Namaste!",UgxnSTN8rVOVZeourxB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-12-05T17:44:44Z,0.9843249320983887

This was a wonderful session with lots of very deep breathing and breathing rhythms. This session isn't all that physically intensive, however it is nice as a form of meditation. I loved the breathing and the arm vinyasas. I really fell into the ending vinyasas in our kneeling pose. I didnt want them to stop.

I've been doing your 30 days programs for a few years now, and I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised at how my body just transformed in 30 days my very first time doing it! I never do it ALL the way through in 30 days, but maybe 34-35 days. Non the less I can't deny the miracle of yoga! Thank you Adrian!!! I have turned so many people on to your programs, and I'm always working on convincing more people to try, and feel great with Adrian.  Thank you for posting your videos on YouTube. Like many, I'm happier sweating, moaning,  groaning, and sometimes expelling gas ü§ó lol,  at home by myself. I saw a commercial where I saw 2 women. Both were 80, but one looked like your average 80 year old; walker, hunched over shoulders, bent over, walking with a walker! The other lady looked like she was in her 40s, strong, vibrant, banging body although she too was 80! The caption...Both these women are 80 years old!

Because of quarantine and full time home office since march, my condition got even worse.

My boyfriend suggested these videos for me and today, only 20 days after I started the challenge, I feel COMPLETELY pain free.

By the end of the practice I felt a lot better and I started thinking about how I do yoga even when I want to get the day started and go through my to do list and run around.

So yoga evens me out- calms and slows me down when I need it, and brightens and awakens me when I need it. The perfect medicine. <3",Ugy9KrPTn86qkdr6uOB4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-10-03T16:39:18Z,0.9827480912208557

246.0,"Day 20 ‚úîÔ∏è Hi friends! I had to recently adjust my yoga schedule to mornings instead of nights accommodate my day, and I was legit bummed for missing my usually scheduled practice. But then I remembered that this kind of thinking has actually set me up for a lot of failures in the past, because instead of going for excellence, I was going for perfection. Just like how I learned from these videos that it's not about hitting the poses perfectly, but rather doing the most mindfully best you can, I realized that I have to unlearn this. Whenever I feel like I start doing things because I have to versus because I want to, it's so easy to lose interest and look for ways to sabotage myself since ""the resistance"" in our brains make it that much more difficult. There was this quote I read somewhere that: ""giving up on your goal because you had a setback is like slashing the other three tires because you got a flat"" really resonated with me. Adjust, but don't stop (heyyoo)! Haha, keep it going friends! üôè",UgxT6iP9hDDI2GcGBYZ4AaABAg,4.0,2.0,2019-11-18T14:08:04Z,-0.9399409294128418

258.0,"My electric bike broke 2 wks ago that I use every day for my 8 mile round trip to a job I hate so im on a normal bike til I can afford to get it fixed, im worn out from this as my job is cleaning offices so im physically moving constantly. Awkward hrs too, 3pm - 9pm. 2 things I commit to doing in the time before work is walk my dog and do my yoga. Im so stressed lately ive had tears quite a bit...today my sister insisted I go for lunch with her and mum, tough as the meal was booked in a place near where my other sister passed  in a road accident last year so it was a hard thing to do. I avoid the town like the plague...The sun was glorious!! The amazing vegan afternoon tea platter the lady put together for me last minute, such imaginative food, even baking me 2 fresh vegan scones!! It was the best lunch ive had in 3 years :) I was blown away at the thoughtfulness and generosity, those scones wouldve set her back timewise as she wasnt prepared for a 3rd person and vegan to lunch. When she came through with the scones for me my face just lit up! And then I felt very calm and still, and brought my hands to my chest (like we do in yoga and we say namaste) and thanked her so deeply and I really really meant that from the bottom of my heart, it felt so natural too! and thats when I knew, Adriene, this thing is changing my life, u really do change lives, have u any idea how ur helping us on so many levels, and u give it so selflessly! I hope before and after u film that u are having the most amazing day :) 
 Today I laid flowers on my sister's grave and didnt sob (1st time). I had a little walk around the town. I biked to work like a badass, reminding myself to sit ""nice and tall""...got home, walked bruce, and just finished day 20, I did it!!!!

Today I felt not in the mood for yoga and exhausted, one third through the session I just stopped and decided to meditate instead. I was forcing myself to do it snd it wasn‚Äôt feeling any good. Last few minutes I resumed the session. I am not going to back down, I have a gaol of achieving full 365 days of yoga. If I cant do anything, at least meditate. 

Namaste.

587.0,"Hi Adriene! 30 days has been my introduction to yoga. For me, yoga has been about growing my strength and balance and I'm so glad I've found your videos that allow me to do so with playfulness, ease, and self-love.

I can almost always keep up, at least at your beginner moves, although I often fall - balance is tricky for me! It is getting better with each practice. :)¬†

Two questions! I have a hard time transition from plank (or three legged dog) to a lunge. I just can't bring my front leg all the way forward. I always have to lower my back leg first, which puts me a breath behind you. Any advice?

Also, there was one video where you had us sit on our bums, legs out in a V and bend forward. I discovered that day that my inner thighs are very very tight - I could hardly bend forward at all, not to mention get to my elbows. I've been practicing that move at the end of each practice and I find happy baby feels good too. Any advice on increasing my flexibility there?

621.0,Just a warning about heros it can mess the ligaments in your knees up because the knee is a hinge joint. Eventually by placing your knee in the hero position too often and too much can stretch the ligaments out and they'll never return to normal unlike your muscles. Having stretched ligaments will make your joints like jello and make it hard to walk. If possible please don't do hero pose instead do a variation with your feet under your butt :) Stay safe everyone!,Ugiwl2C_1opbgXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-02-17T02:15:37Z,-0.9992721676826477

Was able to stay in hero today for longer than i ever have. I was even a rebel and stayed in it for the rest of the practice. I find it hard to do that. I'm always one to follow the rules and not always listen to my body because I'm so strict and anal about things but through this practice and from practicing with you for 7 months now i can finally hear what my body is trying to tell me on the mat and in my everyday life.
