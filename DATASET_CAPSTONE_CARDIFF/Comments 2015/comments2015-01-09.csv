I love Adrienne because she‚Äôs so encouraging; instead of telling you to push through it, she tells you it‚Äôs ok to take breaks and focus on your shoulders and breath. Sometimes those little reminders are super important because I find myself getting all clenched up again.

481.0,"I usually find these videos to be whole heartedly wonderful, but today I sprained my right arse cheek on the warrior pose. I did not even know it was possible to do such a thing. I also never knew how much I valued my arse cheeks and the movement they gave me until this evening - which is a new insight that Adriene has given me through the 30 days of Yoga series. I probably wounded my chunky boi cheek because I usually do nothing but sit on sed chunky boi cheek all day every day, and so the sudden movement of these daily yoga sessions was too intense for my tender behind. Injuries aside I'm only on day 9 and it has completely changed my life already, I have  a whole new mentality and now practice the breathing techniques outside of these sessions when I am stressed in the daytime. Even though my arse cheek is now bearing a rather smarting pain, in the video today I was more flexible than ever in my life and was definitely feeling stronger in the positions I achieved pre-cheek-gate. Cannot rate this series and Adriene enough, I have been and will continue to recommend her to everyone I know and will live vicariously through them as they practice the poses whilst I wait for my right cheek to bounce back. In the meantime I may give her ab or arm work out yoga challenges a try, to give my arse a break but to keep up with the daily yoga because it makes me feel so damn good!

I took a few child's pose recesses and totally didn't do the push ups in the end, but that's okay. 


I look back on the first day and how I did that two days in a row because I found it so hard the first time, and how easy that day is to me now, and I know in a week or so some of these moves will be easier!

599.0,"This was a nice practice to come back to.  I had to take a two day break after a chiropractor adjustment.  I learned I have an extra vertebrae, and two growth points that haven't developed; probably won't either.  Also, he said my left leg is shorter than my right.  I had an accident little over a year ago which had my left leg split open, and it healed fine.  The problem was when I went to go help outside, after it healed, my back started hurting all along the hip line.  I've been going to the chiropractor for over a year just for this problem.  I started doing these Yoga videos in late Feb of this year.  This is my fifth 30 day journey, and I find these fun to do.  I'm glad I started doing them.  I know I've lost weight, and toned up a lot since I first started.  I really don't think the problem happened from the fall, but it was from an accident I had when I was younger.  I was skateboarding, and went down this little sidewalk hill.  I fell, and cracked my tailbone area.  It was tremendous pain, and I had to walk, at least six months, in pain from class to class.  I don't think it healed properly, so I believe that is one of the many factors that contributes to this back/hip pain.  It was sure nice to get back on to doing these videos again.  It was like starting up a car, and saying come on girl don't fail me now.  xD",Ugw1wVElzbtPiJOIWup4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-08-04T16:00:51Z,0.9793094396591187

643.0,"I did this challenge from February to March of 2016, and wow, it transformed my mind and bonus- I lost a few pounds!
Since then, I practice yoga with Adriene's videos as often as I can, and it really helps me improve in the respective aspect I am trying to improve with that practice.
I haven't been daily consistent for a few weeks now, but I've been following the April 2019 ACT playlist. Before I could click on the day 9 video, I saw this video for the 30day challenge
So I did this one instead.
And no regrets.
It was like a workout, but I needed this detox, both physically and (especially) mentally. 

I'm just so grateful for being physically able to do yoga, and to be able to follow along with such an amazing teacher and so many yogis in training all around the world.

I began searching YouTube for good yoga videos, and the moment I found your channel and saw the first video on this playlist, I fell in love. My posture has been amazing, my back doesn't hurt anymore. Another thing that has improved is my knee is naturally unaligned with my foot, I usually cant bend it certain ways or even do lunges. However, doing yoga with you has slowly adjusted my knee to be more even! I was able to do most of the lunges today (I only fell over once) and now I can sit in meditation pose with only a slight pain, compared to day one when my knee was screaming. Thank you so much Adriene, you've helped me heal myself in my body, my mind, and my soul. :)",UghEDZ0wJhwJdHgCoAEC,1.0,4.0,2017-06-30T04:09:37Z,0.9969511032104492

1094.0,"I don't know why but this one was especially awesome. I think I found myself breathing deeper and REALLY feeling the fresh air going deeeeeep into the bones. At the end of the practice, I was thinking, YES, this is the yoga feeling I LOVE and why I practice. I'm a ""go hard or go home"" type, but I practiced patience with first few videos being only just 10-15 minutes (also realized how TIGHT I was then and needed to practice patience with that as well) and am loving the ease into the longer ones. Can't wait to see what the rest of the series brings. 

Also, for what it's worth, I don't do this practice every day, maybe skip a day or two because of other workouts or life schedule, but I'm finding that doing it that way is actually making it more sustainable, instead of putting stress on myself to do it every. single. day.

Plus, I love how goofy Adriene is. Doesn't take it too seriously but yet you get a great practice in. Can't wait to try Yoga Camp and Revolution!",Ughre8q9klU9SXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-02-07T20:22:08Z,0.9991148114204407

Even though I broke my streak by going to a camp where there was no wifi, I felt so much stronger after only 8 days! (although I definitely missed yoga) I did caving and risked my life multiple times, probably only getting out of those caves in one piece because of the awareness I had with my body. I squeezed my body through scarily tight spaces but stayed calm because of your yoga. I even absailed 50m! Mind you I cried before I went and after. But I did it! You've made such a difference to how I feel about myself and how my life has been going. Maybe I'm not in tears during my sessions but I feel so much better for them, both inside and out.

to start doing Yoga. I've never done it before but a lot of friends
recommend I start. So I looked it up on Youtube and found you. 
Your
video's are amazing. I'm loving this! Day 8 & 9 made me realize
that I definitely need this. Taking time to create that space for
myself, its also an act of self love. So yea, Day 8 & 9 made me
cry a little, very powerful stuff. My main reason for starting yoga
was to help me reduce my anxiety in the mornings, Goal accomplished!

1361.0,"I'm trying to figure out if maybe I'm just tired but it feels like there was a huge jump in difficulty between this day and the last 8. Obviously the last was meditation but I had the hardest time keeping up today. It seems like on the day you recorded this you were bursting with energy (which isn't a bad thing!). 

I usually do my 30 days of yoga practice first thing in the morning so that's probably part of it. I had to keep pausing the video to look at what you were doing. Each time I figured out a pose we were already onto the next. I'm going to walk myself back through it and try to get more out of each step but I felt like I was half assing it to keep up and that's when I had to stop to start again.

When I re-watched the knee to elbow and realized you leaned forward which naturally brought the knee closer and that helped a lot. I guess that's the benefit of the videos is that I can always go back. 

When I hear you say ""on an inhale"", or ""on an exhale"" in between I find myself holding my breath because I'm not sure where we're going in these faster sessions. I really want to stick with it and improve. Maybe the slower and deeper yoga sessions are more for me. I'm still a beginner.

I took one day off yesterday because I was sick but today I decided to give day 9 a try and I seriously surprised myself with my own strength! The half chaturanga's & wide leg push ups were challenging but not difficult as they would have been a week ago...taking that day off and coming back to the mat really made me aware of how much stronger I am and how positive I have become towards my yoga practice and as a result towards my body and personal attitude! I was struggling with chaturanga about a month ago, not feeling like I had made any improvements and now I flow through them with ease and have even begun trying one legged flows...Thank you so much Adrienne! It's only 9 days in and I already feel like the best version of myself....I can't wait to see what happens over the next few weeks!
