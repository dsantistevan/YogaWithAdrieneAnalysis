I have made it this far and managed about 3-4 days per week in my schedule and have been noticing a big difference in my movements in daily life since the first week. I enjoy your soothing tone and energy while I follow the routines first thing in the morning soothing my energy for the day ahead. Thanks again!

I have so much love and respect for you and your teaching style, thank you for bringing me back to yoga. I am from India and used to do yoga as a child, despite being crazy good at it i never enjoyed it half as much as i do with you; eventually i gave up on it until i found you and now i look forward to it, practice twice a day and feel the best i have in years.  namaste.

It's only taken a global pandemic, multiple lockdowns and a need to fill my time with something mindful but I'm so proud of myself for making it this far 😄 it's taken longer than 30 days, but I've learnt to forgive myself for the 'missed' practices and carry on rather than give up completely. 

Any playlist recommendations for the next 30(ish) days? I'm still a newbie and need this guidance in my practice!

89.0,"I started this 30 day yoga challenge in 2017 with my best friend. We were trying to motivate each other to be healthier and more productive. We wanted to improve our lives, we wanted to feel happier! And it was fun to do yoga together! Shortly after we started, my best was killed in a biking accident. The past few years have been really hard for me. I was so unhappy, for so many reasons. About a year ago, I was so tired and so sick, I was addicted to drugs, I wasn't eating or getting out of bed. A couple more big, really tough, things came my way, and then I finally decided I needed a change..So I started to! It has been a slow journey, and 2020 has been hard too, really hard.... but I haven't let myself slip! 26 days ago my mom sent me a link to day 1 of your 30 day yoga challenge, I honestly broke down crying. It was hard to start it again without my friend, but now on day 26 I feel so proud and so happy and I miss her so much but I know she would be proud and happy too. I feel a special connection to these videos and it has made my practice so fulfilling. I appreciate you, Adriene so much, you are such a bright soul! beaming! You have helped me a lot.

128.0,"Those tabletop crunches were not easy haha. I really enjoyed all the stretching and breathing with this practice though. It made the time go by really fast and I was surprised when we got into Shavasana. I feel like I've been having a hard time with motivation for the last week almost and my daily workouts have become a lot more of a chore than they used to be. I really hope I get my second wind soon because I don't want to quit, I want to keep up this habit because honestly, it's the best thing I've done for myself in years. I almost feel like I've hit a wall and that's why I'm losing motivation. When I first started I was improving practically every day, but as I continue to practice I have slowed down in my progress and sometimes I feel like I'm even doing worse. I realize this is natural and it happens to everybody. Progress isn't exponential and I won't be seeing obvious improvement in such a short amount of time. Knowing that doesn't make it any less discouraging though. I also realize this is a temporary mood and that if I just keep myself mentally strong and push past this apathetic wall that I will start to enjoy myself again. These 26 days with Adriene have been a complete joy, however, and leaving these daily comments have been very therapeutic, almost like a diary haha.

185.0,"Like a lot of people when lockdown began in my country. I told myself I'll use that time to be productive. That is read more books, spend less time online, start learning German again, workout more, draw..but only thing I did was your 30 days of yoga. 

Today finally reached 26 days..with a few break in between but finally made it. But I didn't really wanted to get on my mat today. Not when my strong bond with my mum is crumbling. I'm not here looking for pity. But my mum, my most important person is suffering but I can't help her. Regardless of what me or her family is telling her she chose to stay blind. She's in a toxic relationship. But because the guy doesn't beat her, she think it's okay. Because the guy bought her a home, then it's okay. She's married to him. I've tried everything but now I'm tired and decided to not talk to her. But it hurts and it's so difficult. So difficult to not respond to her msg but everytime I get into a fight with the guy, next day she act as if nothing happened. I can't keep on pretending like this. So difficult to go on my life, be in my happy relationship why she suffers. It's horrible. I don't get why she won't wake up. My mum has always been strong but she became so fragile, skittish. The guy always belittle her... I get into fight with him as my mum confide in me but I can't stand by without not doing anything. 

So regardless of that today I got on my mat. I didn't smile while stretching, all I could do was cry. But I'm still thankful to have this video.
I'm sorry I know it's not the place to talk about this, but idk. It's hard 

Thank you Adriene, for making me get on my mat every morning even though I just want to cry. I'm not good at yoga, I'm not flexible at all, I can't reach my toes be it while standing or sitting. When I started I had lots of muscle pain but it's getting better. I can feel my body getting stronger.",UgxYpd5Fk1wwRvL_spB4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-05-14T17:39:30Z,-0.9941892623901367

I started this before the calls for isolation and working from home here in 2020 and it has been an anchor of reminding me what day of the week it is and maintaining some of my mental health during this change.

274.0,I have been doing yoga for almost 15 years on & off.  I recently had a subtotal hysterectomy & thought I should slowly get back into a practice.  My husband & I started with your Beginner's video for my first 2 weeks back following full recovery.  We then moved onto the 30 day challenge & here we are at day 26!  You have helped me gradually ease back into practice & I am forever thankful for these inclusive videos.  We plan on still doing them when we finish our 30 days & we may even go to an actual class together shortly.  We've never felt better!

337.0,"As always, I feel like I can't adequately express how much I appreciate this channel <3 

This might be too honest, but as a person who struggles with disordered eating, this is doing wonders for me. I usually think of exercise exclusively as a means to expand calories. But when I get on the mat, I forget about that. Instead of constantly thinking ""Now I've burnt x many calories"", I feel like I can fully inhabit and feel my body and its movements for a little while without my mind getting in the way. 

I used to give up on exercise when things got hard, because I could only focus on how I wished I looked and that's frankly not a very good motivation. Just makes you feel bad. (SO BAD). But this doesn't feel that way at all; it feels fun and playful, even when it's challenging.

369.0,"I like the restorative practices that teach us to take care of our temple. Coming from an army background, we were taught that “pain is weakness leaving the body!”.... No. If the body is in pain, it’s a sign to slow down to restore. Just the other day I injured my knee working out. I totally babied that knee and I’m back at it with functioning knees. You don’t have to “push through” everything, and that’s why I love restorative yoga because it reminds you to love your body, and not force it. Yoga in general does this, but restorative yoga specifically highlights this point. 🧘🏾‍♀️ Namaste 🙏🏾",UgyVZ8WBZTbS3TnLMCB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-09-18T03:45:15Z,0.9928187727928162

374.0,"First of all, 

“The love of Light in me honors the Light in you!” 


Secondly, Thank you for keeping Yoga weird. Portland is fun, because it welcomes the weird. Texas is a ball,  because BBQ’s and pit masters are considered sacred; just like food is fuel for the body.. I feel like your feed helps my soul with the constant reminder that we control our sessions. Whether we push ourselves on the days where it’s hard to balance our life or rock happily in our comfort zones like a happy baby. My days feel much more at ease when I begin my workout journey with you as one of my guides. 

Thirdly, the other day I did a little session by myself by the lake and had to give you props! I am flexible as the heavens, always have been, but I never ever did yoga by myself without a teacher. I always went to classes and yours by far is the best, because you are constantly reminding me to try it without holding your hand or being told to just because it’s good for me.  My mind should be telling my body or vice versa to do so and a couple of days ago it did. Thank you for this renewed strength and confidence that I can lead my own ritual. The silence and sensations I felt and heard by Japan’s lake will forever hold a place in my memory bank and heart, many Thanks to yoU!

I can hold downward dogs now!! And plank??!! Wow I’m keeping up with all the planks. The squats my feet come to the ground and downward dog they are pretty close. My flexibility has increased beyond my expectation starting forward fold no where near touching the ground now can put my palms on ground.

We all have issues of one kind or another, struggles that limit us. Adrienne you have given us the freedom to fly when we are held grounded by our ailments both physical and mental. Your experience, your advice are just beautiful gems of wisdom. Your approach is so generous and inviting. I  researched yoga before I started. I swear I found you, (although millions had found you first), you embody such grace and warmth; it is felt through the screen. 

Through you, I have found some peace, and pleasure for the first time in a long time. I must live on a very restricted and limited diet just to not feel sick. Food is everything to me, it is how I show my love, it is family and friends. Now it is the enemy that stops me from experiencing those pleasures; this basic pleasure.

I am very flexible and practicing yoga everyday is helping me to feel good in my body (I'm so flexible that it gave me trouble with my knees, hips and back so the doctor said to stretch myself everyday). I also stopped smoking, cold turkey, (after 12 years!) and I think you really helped me because I didn't touch a cigarette in more than 1 month now. One of my flatmates said the other day that we are gonna miss you when those 30 days will be done...that is true, you became kind of a part of ""the family"" at home :). I also found my abs again and lost a bit of weight. I will keep practicing yoga the most I can with your videos. Thank you for being so cool, nice and positive. You are a great person and the best yoga teacher !",UghtEGu_q8gfvXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-07-13T00:45:14Z,0.9995715022087097

683.0,Thank you so very much for this 30 Days series. I feel strong and am finding each day alittle easier. I also inspired two of my Ravelry friends to jump in and they've been following along as well. Love your videos and love how they've inspired me to take yoga to that next level. And I've just about gotten a handle on mermaid pose by adding it to the end of each day's practice. And I have you to thank for that. So thank you.

Never knew yoga would help me that much, really. Also I noticed after a long time without doing HIIT, thinking I couldn't do it because of the lack of practice I didn't just could do the whole workkout routine, but also could endure more than what I was used to before. Thanks a lot. I'm not the kind of comment poster suscriber, but I thought I needed you to know how much you have helped me. Thank you.

I never thought id be into yoga this much, with this challenge I have found myself needing to do yoga everyday as an anxiety reliever and it's amazing how it's helping me. Not to mention it just makes me feel great and happy and relaxed! I cannot wait to further my practice after the 30 day challenge & see where it takes me! Iv already noticed things I had a struggle with in the beginning become easier to achieve as time goes on and I absolutely love that! I love your videos and how you don't rush things, you always allow others to ""find what feels good"" and to make it your own, or finding organic movement which is great! So with that being said, thank you, thank you and thank you!!! ❤️ you and yoga have changed my life for the better! Xoxo!
