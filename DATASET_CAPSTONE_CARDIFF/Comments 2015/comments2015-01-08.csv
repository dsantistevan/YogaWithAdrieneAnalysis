The music was extremely relaxing and peaceful through the session. I had a blast with the one legged pigeons too.

I was going through today's video a little disappointed with myself for not being able to squat as wide as I thought I'd be able to, but as I was doing the one-legged pigeon pose I figured that it'd probably end up helping with my hips.

Btw if u can‚Äôt tell by now I‚Äôm a huge Star Wars fan n fully believe in the force and meditation. I loved this session.
Lastly 16 minutes in I love yer imagination! It works for me especially with my eyes closed I‚Äôm a very visual person so I appreciated that imagery of our heads spilling out. Lol and finally...since u mentioned it, I‚Äôll leave u with one of my fave non SW quotes. (My other obsession, cosmic horror & HP Lovecraft): the oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear.

506.0,"I heard a great quote today:  ""Don't let what you can't do get in the way of what you can do.""  

What I had to do today (for the first time) was stop the video not once but three times to get my self set straight in the squat.  My heels weren't going to come down without elevation. And my hip flexors screamed toward the end of the hold.   And the arm overhead in squat wasnt going to happen today, so I simply held the squat.  However, I was able to come up on one foot in crow.  Huge accomplishment.  I don't see both feet off the ground any time soon, but that one foot off the ground was a small victory.

But this practice brought back the good memories and that I can do it again. Then, I felt like JCVD training in Bloodsport with the ropes extensions and had the soundtrack playing in my head. Hahaha, so I dedicate that part of the practice to JCVD. And the third? Holy moly, I had a profound existential experience. And to top off my confusing emotions of joy and sadness, the video ended and the next one started playing of 8 hours of ASMR rain drop sound effects and I was mind blown.

Whole day at work I was feeling so drained getting nothing done and back at home I just started crying again because I didn't get an answer from my boyfriend for like 15 minutes. I genuinely don't know what was going on with me today but was soo much looking out for the practice - and it just fitted perfectly! I could let everything go and feel so relaxed right now!

I held it for a second and had to drop down, then the i rolled and did it again for an extra second longer. Wow. Just your mind taking in that you are balancing your body in that position via your shoulders.... is incredible in itself.
Like the plank yesterday, it was a challenge, that i had to repeat trying several times until i could manage it.
Now I want to improve on it. I hope it comes up in one of the next sessions in this practise!

I feel different after this session, less angry. It's day one for me, so I'll just go with that until 30.  Don't hate. Meditate, and be great. Thank you Adrienne!

They put me in so much pain i cry when i try to hokd them. I can do it for a very short  period but i cant hold in that position.

1591.0,"I am loving the internal feeling I get from doing yoga with you but I am still struggling a lot with my total inflexibility. When you sat down on the mat with your legs out in front of you in a V and you then walked your hands forward until your head was on the block in front of you, I was sitting with my legs in a V and I don't even have enough flexibility to bring my body to a fully upright position. I was slightly leaning back and when I would breathe out and push forward, my legs would lift off the floor.

I am 40 years old and have lived a life with little to no stretching and now I find myself wondering if I have left it too late. If I keep doing yoga every day will the flexibility come or is it possible that I have just started too late in life?

Just a few weeks ago I was saying ""Yeah, sure, I would love to exercise every day, but where the heck would I fit that into my life?"" Now I find myself longing for my yoga and committing to it wholeheartedly. I would never have thought that I would do an hour of yoga several days a week (that's right, I do two days' worth of the 30 day challenge some days just because I CAN'T WAIT till the next day!) and enjoying myself all the time.

1662.0,"Is there an additional option to some of these seated positions that require you to tuck your legs in and cross them. I have a previously torn meniscus and just cannot put that pressure onto my knee. I understand it has to do with my flexibility in my outer hip region which I am working on currently. Also a bulging disc in l5-s1 that has caused the lack of mobility in the outer hips, entire back, and groin.

I ask as these positions are wonderful for my lower back being able to fold over my legs and reach out. I just get nothing significant out of them if I need to stop where my knee's hurt which is prior to being able to lean into it whatsoever.",Ugiu6nPfLtAquXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-12-08T19:19:39Z,-0.9909989833831787

1702.0,"It has been a very long year - full of stress and anxiety stemming from so many different sources. Before starting this challenge, I had knots the size of plums in my back and neck. In fact, I couldn't remember the last time I didn't have these knots constantly screaming down my spine  and out through my eye balls! Determined to feel happy and healthy, I set out on a voyage of self-reflection and change; which led me to this challenge. Having completed day 8 of this 30 day yoga journey, I am pleased to announce that the knots have melted away and I have taken a much more proactive and positive approach to the things that once cause so much distress.

Thank you so much Adriene for your guidance in my practice. Everyday has been just what the doctor ordered and I look forward to the next 22 days. Thank you for your light hearted nature and for creating an invitational practice where I can be forgiving to myself, accepting of where I am and celebrate the steps I am taking in the right direction.

Too many youtube yogi's out there seem to be doing what they do for the money and/or fame. It's just refreshing to see that you truly believe in what you do. Today's practice literally left me in tears from all the pent up emotions I hold carry inside on a day to day basis. Keep doing what you do Yoga With Adriene !

Though I have to emphasize that I find it only with your guidance. Other teachers I've found just go along poses and remind me to breathe from time to time.
But Day 8 was pure magic. No, not like a crazy trance, but certainly something was happening, though I never thought it would. Not that I was against meditation and didn't believe in it totally. I just thought it wouldn't work for me because of me, because I can't do it. Well, you guided me into it. And yes, it did work.

I love you Adriene! Thank you for all the changes you've brought into my body, mind and life. Yoga (with you!) is one of the best things that have ever happened to me. Top 3 on the list I think ;)",Ugg41PbAvEjKkngCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-04-15T07:45:09Z,0.9997689127922058

2027.0,Cool videos. i've been getting right into it. first time yogi. I like that you encourage a more spiritual meditation aspect to the proceedings and it not just all about the body.

Today I did day 13 with day 8 & miraculously I managed to lift both feet off during the crow pose. I couldn't do it when I started in October and even last week. I was so happy I lifted off (even though it was for like 3 secs).

I usually try to sit up against a wall to take some pressure off, but I kind of feel that's cheating a bit. Any tips on how to make this a bit easier?

2124.0,"Dear Adrienne.
I just wanted to thank you for your videos, and for this one in particular. 
Without knowing it, it was exactly what I needed today. It's never happened to me before, in any kind of practice, but I ended up crying through half of the video, not because I was unhappy, I just couldn't stop. I think the combination of the 30 day journey and  your talk of opening up and letting go of the stress and the worry while focusing on my breath and me, it just opened up for a lot of things.
So all though my yoga mat is slightly tearstained now, I feel a lot lighter :) 
So thank you again, and I look forward to practicing with you :)

Yeah, in fact I really enjoyed it, I had an occasion to experience things with my body and I realised that I was less demanding with myself while being relaxed and I even did better than usual! So thanks a lot, you made my day, I'll start it right now in a positive way! Greetings from France! :) Namaste !",Ugg0_3K5ze5dGXgCoAEC,1.0,0.0,2015-01-09T09:43:39Z,0.9984524250030518

2234.0,What do u think about when you're connecting to the mind? Or rather- 'not' think about...if that makes sense. Do u imagine a person or a place that u love or do u attempt to clear ur head or think about your body's movements?,Ugh13E0xiDrmyXgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-01-09T06:37:58Z,-0.9989451766014099
