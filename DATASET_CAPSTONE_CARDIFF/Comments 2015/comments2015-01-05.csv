27.0,"I am practicing asana with these series of videos for the second time. Since the first time, several years ago, the gift of time and experience has brought me wisdom to ""find what feels good"" despite what Adriene is instructing in the video. For example, I listened to my body and knew that I wanted to modify the poses. Instead of downward facing dog, I chose extended childs' pose and to be on hands and knees, then a modified warrior in a lower to the ground position. I used my blocks. I chose to do what my body was calling for using the knowledge of yoga I have learned from Adriene and from other teachers over the years. Above all else, I was kind to myself. I believe that's what Adriene would want. I will continue on this path of choosing self-care and not forcing my body into shapes; I am a creator being with unlimited potential (and so are you), and I have the freedom to choose what I want and need to do for and with my body. To anyone who reads this, I hope you take a moment to recognize how beautiful, magical, and miraculous YOU ARE.

76.0,I have done two 30 day rounds before this with another instructor. I really appreciate that you treat beginner not as weaklings but is still challenging. I feel I'm at a place I need to advance just slightly and I'm sure impressed and thankful for this free content. As a 45 year old man yoga has returned much of my quality of life back. Always had weak lower back issues. Supposedly I have a herniated disc and degenerative disc disease. Duh who doesn't. It's taken a few months not one or two weeks. But it's as if my body is bulletproofing itself and functioning as it was intended rather than my dumb ass pushing through. For years it took my breath to tie my steel toes. I've been sitting in a squat this entire text. Hahaha..Do it every day. If you miss don't miss twice.. know a huge reward will unfold only for those who know the importance of making time. To many of us watching we've lived half our lives already. I encourage anyone over 40 to get with it. Workout like our lives depend on it. It does.,UgxROOqDhwj6N932uTx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-05-16T16:10:24Z,0.9877020716667175

This session is dominated by breathing and stretching through the sides of our bodies. I found myself coming to this session filled with the distractions and worries of my every day life, and had to start over through the first set of poses in order to bring my focus to my mat. I struggled again to keep my breathing relaxed and in line with my poses, however, by simply keeping my focus on it and trying, I found myself moving through the poses. This session built and built upon itself until I suddenly found myself at the end poses. It was a wonderful way to break from the momentum of my daily life and bring myself back to myself.

I don't believe in confirming to stereotypes n labels, I believe in following this concept n philosophy of doing whatever simply makes u feel like you n makes you feel alive.
As well as challenging yourself, and evolving by pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, questioning your own beliefs, opinions, or choices and well everything. Above all question everything, think for yourself.

My legs are very sore because I have been doing some intense stretches and it has made it harder to do these practices.

Downdog is so _painful_ for my wrists to support.

746.0,"I started this challenge because I moved to South America for my husband's job. We lived in NYC prior and didn't feel right owning a pet in our cramped space, so with my free time we decided to rescue two dogs. Taking care of our girls and being a homemaker is very exhausting. I spent every day of 2017 in the gym lifting weights, but being here, I haven't had the energy (we're in the Andes and the elevation is practically suffocating!) Culture shock hit me pretty hard, something I wasn't expecting, on top of the breathing problems and just general anxiety from not being able to properly express myself in a new language, I started feeling pretty depressed. I decided 6 months of laziness was far too much and found this series. It took me a week and a half to finally hit day 5 (mostly due to constant travel, but also some laziness). I'm definitely doing it at my own pace, but it's also motivated me to get back in the gym. It's also the perfect remedy after a day of lifting because the stretches are sooooo delicious!

I am so proud of myself for keeping on this journey!
I actually had had offline yoga class, 1 hour each day, 2 days per week, and maybe it was because i only took 2 days per week but following the class was too hard for me. Everyone else but me was superb in doing posture and i was hanging on even to the balancing. But I feel more and more stretched and relaxed as this 30 days go on and on! Even just for 5 days i'd done. I am so looking forward to encountering myself 30 days after.    Thank you Adriene!",UgzXQTafOsAdyf7lT4R4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-03-07T15:39:03Z,0.9945780038833618

¬†ive been doing your yoga classes religiously and daily for about a year now. And started my yoga journey about 3 years ago.  for the past 6 months ive been travelling consistently without a home and you are the place i go for my grounding... 
i have one  tip which i think alot of us can maybe benefit more from and its to stay in shavasana ( corspe pose) for AT LEAST a minute...???
¬†its a pose that i adore melting into for up to 10 minutes at the end of sessions. But i cannot do that in these classes! Its difficult to jump up and press pause or close the browser when your already in a blissful place.  It would be a wonderful experience for you to take that extra minute at the end of each class with us in corspe pose! it can take you out of  the sensations the pose can bring when your having to listen to  the end music, then youtube's auto play starts over onto the next session, it can be hard ignoring you going through the beginnings of new classes etc. do you know what i mean ??? 
I LOVE WHAT YOU DO. and thank you so much for all that you do. im a huge fan.

  So a moment of truth... I take this challenge very seriously but cant do it day after say so I practice 1 or 2 times a week and this is feel nice.
this lesson was a little but harder then the previously episodes maybe because ,y lack of flexibility or a bad week.

I can't begin to explain how wonderful it is to have this series on Youtube!
It has introduced me to yoga, and to how wonderful yoga can make you feel.

I have been practicing Yoga for nearly five years no, but never quite regular because of injuries or illness. Also, I travel a lot and have a flexible scedule every day which makes it impossible to attend any regular yoga classes in the gym. I tried so many youtube channels, and basically I love yours. I am only at day 4 but still you give such a quiet relaxend and happy impression of how Yoga can look and work. I often tried to keep up 30 Day Challenges in whatever. Instead of all the pressure that one isn't flexible or strong or thin enough to do it, you make it so pleasant and self confidence boosting. Thank you!!!

Keeping a comment diary as I do this program.

DAY 5:

Well, it's my birthday today!!! Wooho! And I kicked it off with day five yoga. My favorite one so far, great breathing, simple but strong poses. if it's not obvious by now I'll just point out that I'm having issues following this program everyday, but I'm not gvivng up. Found I had balance issues with the enitre warrior pose sequence on my left, but plank and downward dog were a lot of fun. 16 minutes felt really short after getting used to 30 minute sessions. So, hopefully I'm lucid enough tomorrow to make it to day 6!",Ugj8gbwxlLAFD3gCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-02-12T04:03:08Z,0.9846826791763306

Before discovering your videos, I truly despised yoga. The pace, repetition, and unfamiliar movements triggered such deep frustrations that by the end of each session I would be in a horrible, angry mood. I tried different classes, DVDs, youtube videos, and they all triggered the same emotions. Then I found your videos and realized ""so THIS is what yoga is supposed to feel like!""

You have a wonderful energy that is both calming and invigorating. You know exactly how to describe both the physical details and internal sensations of every pose and movement. You're a truly talented teacher.
And please never stop sharing your spontaneous thoughts, no matter how silly they seem. Your lighthearted comments are part of what makes you the incredible teacher you are.

In a month I'll be taking the NASM Personal Trainer Certification test and, despite my diligent studying, I've been very anxious about it. Last night I even had a nightmare about failing it! Already stressed out, I didn't feel that I was the right headspace to do yoga. But upon starting today's sequence (which for me is Day 5) I instantly felt better.

For some reason I felt exhausted and ill since this morning. I was deliberating whether or not to even do yoga today. I finally convinced myself to at least try it, and I'm really glad I did. I feel so much better and energized.

And yesterday my back was really killing me; I don't know if it was my scieatica or an old strain flaring up or what , but I felt such relief from that practice I think I might find a way to incorporate it in my life daily. No medicine has given me such relief, and it was the first time my down dog didn't cause me any back pain.

1720.0,"Thank goodness for this sequence! Today's been hard, first day back to work on less than 2 hours sleep. Yikes! I must admit that was a tiny part of me that said, ""Do you really want to do yoga today?"" The answer? Hell yes! This sequence could not have come at a better time. It really did make me feel alive. I've been practising on and off since July but I'm still very much a beginner but I've felt such a difference in some of the poses in the last 5 days. On day 1 I tried a proper boat pose and fell over! Today I managed to do it! Thank you for the time you put into these videos!

1726.0,Thoughts for today? I am so glad I am doing this in my own home - I am so fat and out of shape and clapped out due to osteoarthritis and cervial spondylosis and a bursa on my right¬†hip as well as neurological problems I couldn't get my elbow to touch my opposite knee. Doh! So glad no one is watching me. However I enjoyed yesterdays' so much I did it before doing this and have found that when warmed up I can actually do the neck rolls which I haven't before. I also do loads of stretch exercises throughout the day and also do between 30 and 40 mins on my treadmill at 3mph. I do ten walk fast 10 up a incline of around 8 then walk until I have done a couple of miles. ¬†30 Days of Yoga? I think that although terrible at it I will do a lesson a day from now on. ¬†:) ¬†My daughter has printed me the calender but how to put my thoughts for the day into one word will be interesting. ¬†LOL ¬†x,UginRMsucwwrangCoAEC,20.0,65.0,2015-01-06T14:43:35Z,0.8879191279411316
