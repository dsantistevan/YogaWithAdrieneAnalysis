0.0,"Day 29 Done! I can't believe Day 30 is tomorrow! But, as my school friends always said, 'It's not goodbye, it's just 'see you later!' Adriene, you are an amazing teacher! You seem to know exactly what we are feeling as and when we feel it. The spine as a staircase is a beautiful metaphor! Yoga has made my planks stronger, my crow poses and wall headstands existent, my warrior 3 stronger and my life happier. I also feel like I've found new friends here. It's great to see everyone encourage and support each other. Big love to everyone on this journey! :)",UggH8H0ET-y0IngCoAEC,3.0,468.0,2015-01-30T17:13:38Z,0.9997826218605042

69.0,Doing this in quarantine and I am so thankful for the peace that it has brought me during this time. I didn't think that I would make it this far in the challenge without wanting to give up. This challenge has helped me so much with my depression and anxiety in the sense that I can feel myself start taking deep breaths when things get hard mentally or emotionally and I am able to tackle tasks that normally would have derailed me before. Thank you so much Adriene! I can't believe Day 30 is tomorrow for me! Good Luck everyone on the 30 Days of Yoga path!

136.0,"Day 29 ‚úîÔ∏è Today I'm part of the midnight Yogi crew who are getting their flow on after 12AM in the comments! Haha! So it also happens to be Bruce Lee's birthday today (or was like an hour ago), and one of his teachings I always enjoy is to ""be like water."" An example of this today would be that I got invited to one of my friend's work parties for Thanksgiving. It's been a while since I've socialized with so many people, and it was pleasant: but so draining! By the time I got home, changed and rolled out the mat, my body was begging for a short nap. Just rolling around in the floor released so many joints and muscles, and I just needed some time to rest. I didn't realize how socializing can be draining fire time and efficient. But my system is fried, and needs sleep. I think I'm just going to ramble on unless I get some sleep, so much love to you all, start empowering yourself with good gear.

I have really enjoyed this practice so much more than I expected. I usually prefer group fitness activities, but I realized that it's because I am so competitive. I use other to motivate me to work harder, go longer, etc. I've had some health issues and right now I can't do the kinds of workouts and activities that I typically enjoy.
So, I came to this practice hoping to begin to heal my body outside of western medicine. It's really been healing my mind. And I found that doing this alone, at home, has really freed me and given me permission to both embrace the challenges and celebrate my own progress without comparing myself to others.

352.0,"Day 29! Adrienne, I have to tell you this free 30 Day Challenge is an awesome thing! I haven't done it every day, but I kept up with it not bc I felt pressured into it, but bc I actually truly enjoyed it. I've always wanted to do yoga but bc of college, no time, and many other excuses, I never did. Until it hit me one day to check for online videos and I came across your challenge. My mom, who's a massage therapist, has noticed a difference in my posture and my chiropractor has noticed differences in my elasticity and says my back and shoulders feel more toned. I've been telling everybody who's interested about your videos! Not to be dramatic, but I feel like this has changed my life. Now, I can't leave my bedroom w/o doing one of your morning sequences to warm up and I enjoy exploring your other longer workouts! I love your sense of humor, your dog is adorable -and, yes, my pup likes to help me too- and thank you SO MUCH for posting these wonderful videos! Even though I'm almost done with the 30 days, I know I'll keep up with your other sequences and continue on with yoga in my life.

You have made me truly love and appreciate Yoga.¬† I have several herniated discs and have since the age of 12.¬† I tried yoga during my college years, but it's only made my pain worse.¬† At 30, I have widespread pain radiating from the herniated discs and my tailbone which was broken twice.¬† I have three tiny kids and work very hard to eat healthy and exercise so I can stay in shape and be flexible and strong enough to take care of everything, but my stress was still through the roof.¬† I discovered your channel 2 weeks ago and have been doing your videos daily, sometimes 2 a day.¬† I am so grateful for your channel and your calm, accepting, and positive attitude.¬† I am finding myself taking deep breaths throughout the day and more thoughtfully choosing my actions, rather than reacting to stressful situations.¬† Thank you so much for making Yoga fun and accessible to people of all different capabilities.¬†
