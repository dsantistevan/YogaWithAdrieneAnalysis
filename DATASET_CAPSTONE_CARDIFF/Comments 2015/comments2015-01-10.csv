I had never heard of the channel, I knew nothing about yoga other than that ""sun salutations"" was a thing some people did daily, and I wanted to try that. When I began typing into the search box, ""yoga with Adriene"" was the top suggested auto-complete, and so when this video came up again in the results, I decided to try it. Afterwards I of course had to look up your video on Ujayi breath! 

I practiced the sun salutation with you for many days, then I found the runners warm up/cool down videos, and finally this 30 day journey as well as Yoga Camp. I've been following the channel ever since.

After Breath this year, I decided I would re-do all of the 30 day journeys from the years, in order, as some of them have all blurred together in my memory. Here I am on day 10, back where it all started.

After a week and a half, I decided I‚Äôd try your 30 day challenge. This is also the first time I‚Äôve stuck to any exercise routine. I felt day 9 was a little cruel. üòÇ I struggled, and even began questioning myself. Maybe it‚Äôs just not for me.?. But, NO.. Day 10 has brought so much together for me.. I can comfortably get full palms on the mat in a forward fold, whereas before was just tips of fingers. I can comfortably get my heels on the ground in downward dog, and for the first time just now, I felt how it‚Äôs a resting pose. I did downward dog on my first day and it almost broke me. üòÇ 
Day 10 is also the first time my breath came naturally without thinking about it, and I followed your timing on key. Then I like to do a couple more things after the video. The crow pose intrigued me, (I forget which day that was üôÑ) so I‚Äôve practiced that after each routine since that day and just now is the first time I‚Äôve held it for 10 seconds.

Surya namaskar is an exercise which effects your whole body that's why our ancestors called it Surya namaskar. Surya is one of the hundred names of God also because mediating and worshipping the formless God gives a lot of physical and spiritual power.

Then things happened, one Saturday I didn't do it and Sunday I had news that made me really sad, as well as disrupted my schedule. It's been 9 days without the practice, coincidentally. And today I woke up sad and anxious as I have been for many days but decided that I would try again and that I would continue the challenge instead of going back to day one because I am finally realizing that it is not about being perfect but acknowledging my progress. Of course I would love to say I did the 30 days with no miss, but I'm doing them and I hope to keep doing yoga with you for way longer because it's been a transformative force in my life. So thank you for all the good energy and effort you put in your videos. You are a true light!

243.0,"Perfect for morning ritual n wake up routines! Once u get this whole video memorized the positions n flow, (is there a word for all those things in yoga combined?) Finally once u do, I recommend some background music it always helps me wake up n set my mind n body frequencies to where I wanna be n how I wanna feel (music is such a powerful tool for that) but I recommend listening to ‚ÄúThe Sun‚Äù by Parvo Stellar, ‚ÄúHere comes the sun‚Äù by the Beatles of course (for pop ppl), for punk rock lovers: ‚ÄúSunday‚Äù by The Menzingers, & ‚ÄúSummer Burst‚Äù by Morning Glory, and for metal heads if there are any here doing yoga (or for those adventurous bold few who just love music n will try new things): ‚ÄúSunbather‚Äù by Deaf Heaven, & ‚ÄúFear Innoculum‚Äù by Tool (I use this a lot for background music during yoga it‚Äôs perfect so is ‚Äú3rd Eye‚Äù by them bcuz the lyrics although not about this sun theme, it certainly fits with Yoga by forcing u to fit patterns of moving n breathing n lyrics that specifically drive the pure simple activity of breathing in deeper home into your brain), also I like a lot of post rock instrumental or remixes or soundtracks sometimes.
So I hope this helps some ppl, n if u feel like u can‚Äôt find time in the morning, u can! Just try 1 or 2 days at first, plan ahead with the intention of waking up a lil earlier maybe or managing yer time differently, it‚Äôs soooooooo worth it, the reward of calmness, centeredness, focus, clarity, bring your spirit into your body n body back to life after sleeping is so incredible. Give it a try for your own sake.
I hope my comment n suggestions help a few ppl at least. I‚Äôm just trying to give back to something that has given me so much!

I've tried many other yoga videos before and they always seem to move to the sun salutation on day 2 or 3, but not Adriene.  And that is the best a sun salutation has ever felt for me.  Improved flow through the transitions and I didn't collapse as much as I have in the past.  It's not perfect, but it is great progress.

But thanks to Adriene I know, that this is perfectly fine! I just wanted to share this, because maybe other people are thinking that after 10 days of Yoga they have to see big improvements in flexibility. Don't quit because of this. Do yoga for your heart!

(my whole motivation is I can't have my night glass(es) of wine without doing yoga). I come home after a super trying day at work and I'm still on the phone with my fitness guru brother who I'm ranting to my day about. I drink a glass of wine thinking I'll do yoga afterward. I'm on the second glass of wine when my brother randomly inspires me to not skip a day. I hang up from him and do this work out. While I'm a somewhat alcoholic and I don't recommend my crazy regime I will say this is one of the best work outs I've had this week. Because I wasn't thinking. I just went into it. I have never been able to do a vinyasa before and tonight I freaking did it! I did all these moves and I honestly equate it to being out of my own head!

1180.0,"Adriene <3 As much as I am drawn to yoga, I've always struggled the most with the downward-facing dog position. I grew up dancing ballet and love pilates and yoga, but no matter my physical flexibility at large, my lower back has always been very fixed and stiff. Hence, finding a balanced downward-facing dog position have been difficult, making me hesitant towards the practice of sun salutations as something that could be beneficial to me. After doing the 9 days leading up to Day 10, I've definitely grown to appreciate it more as I've learnt how to develop a variation on the sun salutation that flows the best for my physical set-up. But! With this video, you have converted me all the way! This is by far the best sequence I've ever done and my body really loves doing it!

So I am on Day 10 and this is my second attempt at completing this yoga series. ( I gave up the first time, but Im not giving up this time!) I do have one concern.

It was wonderful and energizing, and made me truly aware of my breathing. Since I was young I've had the problem of running out of breath quicker than others, and I noticed that in this sequence as well. What would you recommend? Should I speed up the sequence to match my breath, should I try and breath deeper and slower? Is it actually possible to ""train"" the breath just like you would the muscles of your body? That would be great, for yoga and for my everyday life. Thank you for these great videos.
