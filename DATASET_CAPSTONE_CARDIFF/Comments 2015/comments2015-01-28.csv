0.0,"Adriene! I can't thank you enough. This practice was very emotional for me today (I truly connected). I've been out of shape for a while. And for the last two years I've been suffering from regular panic attacks and anxiety. I didn't feel good in my body or my head. And after thinking about it for years, I finally decided to start yoga. You're the only instructor that was able to inspire me, that I was able to connect with. You made me feel like I could do it. I was terrified to start the challenge, but look at me, just finished day 28!!! I already feel stronger and I have more energy. Some days I don't even have anxiety, which is amazing. Thank you for all you are doing, you ARE making a difference in people's lives. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Much love to you, my friend. <3

Full journey comment thread is on the Day 1 video:) [Day 28/30]

Day 28 - Wow that flipped Downward Dog was insane, but what's crazier is the fact that I even managed to pull it off!  Felt so good to do a difficult move.  Overall great video again, was great for my entire body and I loved how Adriene gave us a bit more freedom on how to transition into different positions.  It's a nice subtle way to show her build in trust in us over this 30 day journey and to remind us that it's always been us in control, not Adriene:)",UgyphcOdFysufUBb_5B4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-06-15T15:53:51Z,0.994220495223999

you're a star and thank you again.
I would like to ask you if you do yoga specifically;;y for knee pain? I've tried your back, hip and neck and many many more .

When she says don't worry if you fall we will catch you and well I am worried cause it is a real possibily and no one will.  But on the other handling I guess the people struggling a lot with this already likely dropped out and I am determined to finish.  My flip the dog was a flop the dog and so many things I can't get anywhere close to what she is doing.

137.0,"""As we kind of peel off the old layers of paint...""

That one really moved me inside... It put in words how it does feel  for me. Going my own way, loving these yoga sessions, other processes in my life.

Like peeling off all the layers I put on myself, which gave me a look that wasn't even me. While peeling off, my true colors shine through again from behind the layers. First, it scared me to shits. Now, it feels good and it hits me that I got here. 
Happy tears role over my cheeks during this session.

 ❤ Thank you Adriene, for you being you. And for adding so much to my process in life. I send you my Love 🙏",UgzXRdgmt1j1WAK8mht4AaABAg,0.0,5.0,2020-02-21T11:01:46Z,0.999347984790802

150.0,"Day 28 ✔️ Hi everyone! I hope you've been able to overcome the obstacles in your path to grow and continue on this yoga journey until today (hopefully beyond)! Today was another restorative day today, and not too long ago I was really frustrated with myself when I couldn't do the flow because I lost my balance or didn't have the strength or flexibility yet to do something. But it helped me to think of yoga as a long-term relationship; that you'll stick through the difficulties and keep showing up to put in the work no matter what, because you love yourself, what you do and those important to you. Being accountable for my own health has created a more empathetic individual, because whenever I need rest or feel frustration, I know it's because I'm doing my best to grow, rather than just complain about the world and being in a defensive and reactive state. Thank you for the continued encouragement teacher and friends 🙏🌞💜",UgwCd79NCDzZgqqzkKV4AaABAg,0.0,23.0,2019-11-27T12:47:34Z,0.9887279272079468

416.0,"Oh Adriene! I'm working out the kinks for sure. Love this morning's invitation. Really feel the playfulness. What has occurred to me is that before I'd do the sequence & then be on with my day. Not in a ""Right box checked, next item"" kind of way, just it didn't occur to e to try something else. This morning I did bridge pose & some wheel prep (any chance of a foundation video for that?) & some bound angle work.

Really super ready for my day.",Ugj4ED0uP_XjangCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-01-29T08:35:43Z,0.9945952296257019
417.0,"HELLO!! :) So i am only on day 8 right now but id figure id comment on the newest video so you can see my question haha. 
oookay. so I have been doing the thirty days of yoga and a couple other pose videos of yours and my wrists are killing me. They feel better after  i am done with the sequences but during the poses they hurt, should i be ""flexing"" (idk if thats a correct term) or more relaxed in my wrists? ANND is there any certain type of stretches to help with the wrists? thank you! :) have a happy day :)",UghI6E2kM2KKSXgCoAEC,5.0,1.0,2015-01-29T07:05:22Z,-0.9894640445709229

419.0,"Really starting to be able to listen to my body. When you gave us freestyle or playtime in the past, I never really knew what to do. As this challenge progressed and continued I was able to tune into myself more (that sounds weird!  Heheh) and now I don't look at playtime with such confusion. Thank you Adriene.  Have a fabulous day.  Namaste xo",UghLxbMSxYQZX3gCoAEC,10.0,185.0,2015-01-29T06:36:46Z,0.998826801776886
