84.0,"Although I find this great for ""strength"" training, in terms of yoga, and sitting in the poses, to allow the body to connect to spirit and align, I am not very fond of it. Traditionally Yoga, and it's poses are meant for deep reflection and allowing ones body to ""sit"" in the energy of the pose for a while. I have never been a big fan of moving quickly through yoga poses, because for me it's about the journey not the result of the pose, it's about connecting mind, body and spirit to the asana, Hard to find that meditative state of each pose if moving so quickly through them. Also i found this to be more of a 'workout' than a yoga for balancing centre and mind. That being said, I am finding it wonderful for strengthening and toning. I myself am just taking a lot longer to go through the poses as I enjoy sitting in them for a while. :)",Ugw5yjn3KcU4gQ8ER7t4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-10-29T18:25:35Z,0.7252480983734131

It was so freaking hard. I couldn't balance and my legs and knees keep wobbling.
Same feeling of lightheadedness as Day 1. 
My limbs feel like they're ripping apart from stretching not to mention balancing. Adrienne holds her pose for so long and I try to keep up but I end up collapsing in my mat. 
Towards the end of the video, I started becoming negative, thinking I wouldn't be able to do this for 30 days if it's already tough on Day 2 (I'm a perfectionist). Started doing yoga to ease up my stress and anxiety but I feel more stressed doing yoga (hopefully I get to finish the 30 days though). Yoga fans, let me know if that's normal or what.

231.0,"I‚Äôm a complete beginner at yoga. Day 1 was challenging but I was able to complete it with relative ease and felt good. Going into day 2 I thought it was going to be similar. I had to pause this video 3 times to catch my breath. After pausing the first time 15 minutes in I thought it was best to continuing the next day as I felt very winded but reading these comments made me determined to finish this video in one day. At the 20 minute mark I had to pause 2 more times I could barely hold myself up but pulled through. My muscles were burning but it is essentially mind over body.

260.0,"Day 2: Yoga with Adriene - Stretch and Soothe. Gotta admit, this one was a bit tough for me today. It felt good to be moving and stretching, especially my legs and my left hamstring, which I pulled playing hockey two weeks ago. This was not an easy time. There were a lot of moments where I found myself trying to get my breathing under control. Also one of my hang-ups was in finding my balance throughout the session. Those lunge positions really took a toll on me, and while I found myself getting a portion of the movements in, I also fought with my balance a great deal of the time. Furthermore, my ego took quite a big hit tonight. Growing up playing hockey as a goaltender (and still to this day), rowing on a crew team, training through cross-fit, I always found myself to be an athletic person. Tonight, I had a hard realization that I'm not as flexible as I once was, nor am I happy with the state I've let myself fall into. It's been tough with quarantimes, going back to school, and generally finding my life becoming a bit more stagnant than It was. So in this challenge, I resolve to slough off the dross of my lassitude, and recover back into a me that's better in touch with my body. It feels good to be at work once again.

262.0,"journal entry day 2: I almost cried on this one. doing these exercises and breathing forced me to face my realities and insecurities. I remembered as a child I could do the warrior pose, downward-facing dog, and planking so easily, and as an adult, I'm not like that anymore. my muscles are still sore from yesterday and holy shit! so. many. downward. dogs. I almost couldn't keep up. I had to stop the video about halfway. I was letting myself be swept away by my anxieties and needed a moment to breathe and center myself to the moment. I like this instructor. she makes it very clear that I can modify moves to suit my abilities if I needed to and I did for some of them. I love her pace. nothing too hard for too long and easy exercises when needed. her timing is flawless. As hard as it was to do these moves. they are doable. she was right, my body is warm and happy, and is grateful for this exercise. I feel empowered without pain from a HARD workout. if I learned anything from my body this session, my left side is weaker than my right, it was a lot harder to maintain poses and my body is trying to compensate for its weakness which is why my poses look like a Picasso painting. The part of my body I'm most concerned about is my left shoulder. I was diagnosed with rotter cuff tendonitis. no exercise seems to make it better. all I can do is hope for now. if this doesn't work I may need western medicinal intervention. but we will see. one to day 3.",UgzSCpnkanpwZ1fHjYh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-03-31T06:01:04Z,0.9930551648139954

Day 2 - Wow I started this with very tight/obstructed hip flexors in the Child's Pose and ended with a completely new flexibility, mobility and 'looseness.'  Also began to sweat which was a surprise for a complete Yoga newbie!  This was significantly tougher than yesterday for me, but in the end felt so good.

I got a little hard on myself for not being able to follow along. Then I did some Cat-Cow and then did the handshake pose (my name for it). I was very not used to the amount of time I held it; nevertheless it activated my arms, legs, and core considerably, for which I am grateful.


Shortly after, I was told that the next portion will be Vinyasa. Unfortunately, almost every YWA video that is a vinyasa is too fast and difficult for me. So I decided to call it a day.


Remember: Even a small effort is an effort, even a brief practice is a practice. If you choose reduced practice time or even no time at all, forgive everything that stopped you. The release of unpleasant energies is a significant yogic practice in itself. In fact, you can practice yoga every moment of every day. The key is to find the intention.

I kept telling her I don't want to plank I think it's giving me a stroke. She didn't listen... I said I can't spring forward like that it will blow out my rectum. (It didn't but that doesn't mean it didn't feel like it was going to). Finally she was like we aren't planking anymore and I was like thank fucking god. Instead of planking and holding it we had to plank and rock back and forth. That's when I tapped out. I started smelling toast and tingling in my left arm. I collapsed and cried on my mat. Good new was that the toast smell was Kendra making grilled cheese for dinner. And tingling in my left arm was just catastrophic failure of my arm muscle.

1674.0,"Hi, YWA family. So, after a 30-plus year hiatus (I'm in my mid-50's), I've come back to Yoga. I've sustained a couple of injuries (shoulder and achilles), acquired during Bootcamp HIIT, and I was off for nearly six months. I've been attending a weekly local Hatha class for a few weeks, now, and it's done my body a power of good. One of the students introduced me to Adriene only last week. What a brilliant find! I've done the Flexibility, Neck & Shoulders and both the Wake Up and Bedtime sessions.¬†She's so lovely. I feel as though she's giving me a personal yoga session in my living room. I find myself looking forward to each session with her. How strange is that?

Then, yesterday, I decided to start the 30 Days of Yoga journey. Is it me? I've completed day two and wondered if this is really for beginners. I found today really hard going. All those downward dogs and planks. I had to readjust those positions because of my shoulder! Oh my goodness üò∞! I was shaking and sweating and feeling unbalanced - and I couldn't get the lunges right. 

But! I felt great when I was done. Surely, that's the point. Roll on Day 3! Woo hoo!! üôåüèæüòÑ",UgzbkOI0P5l55_FQL-N4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-11-02T15:18:25Z,0.9975761771202087

1962.0,"Thank you for this Video, I was always interested in Yoga but it didn't ""click"" with me with other Yoga Videos on YouTube. But then a friend said she is making a Yoga Challenge and it helps her a lot.
Through this friend I found your Videos and I started trying Yoga üòä I made it to Day 15 half Year ago but then stopped because of life and work but today I think I stopped because I didn't took the time and Energy for it - I just at some point didn't commit to it (the way I did in the beginning).

But yesterday was my birthday and I just really missed something in my life (I am often very Happy and I am blessed with a relatively good life I think) but I missed a mindfulness about or with my Body and Soul. How I feel each Day or even just how my Body feels or breaths. 
So today is the second Day of my Yoga Challenge again. 
I came back here to this channel because I enjoy your way of teaching and Yoga üòä

I hope I will stick to it this time or at least that Yoga itself will become a Part of my life. Thank you for taking me along this Journey again üíï",UgxPIbBJW2exna5OaMh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-05-11T09:05:40Z,-0.9836781024932861

Since then I have been recovering from surgery (not due to yoga, however, :)), I believe I mentioned that in one of your other video comments and this is bringing it all back the challenge of this type of yoga.  I tend to find I don't have enough breath in between moves, so as I did in the class I do a lot of loud breathes out as to keep breathing through my practice.  Also when I started doing yoga some years ago, and always still feel like a beginning due to not being consistent, I experienced severe feet pain and I thank you for addressing that.

I'm curious about the amount of movement though. Most other yoga I've seen moves fluidly from one pose to the next and each pose is very still.

2740.0,"I discovered this channel two years ago when I was diagnosed with Spinal Stenosis. If you don't know what this is it is hereditary and (apparently) can spike up at any time, even active people like myself! I could not walk for a week and a half and realized I had to take action. I was always a very natural healing type of person and refused to see a chiropractor, so I began reading up on natural remedies for back diseases and came across the incredible benefits of yoga and decided i'd give it a shot. I took my computer one morning in search of a youtube yogi and clicked the first one I saw (Adrienne!) . I am proud to say and tell everyone that because of 30 days of yoga, I was able to hike, run and play with my dog again and even became so obsessed I incorporated it into my daily routine. No matter how tired or sick I felt some I did yoga every morning! I currently feel the best i've ever felt in my life and I recommend this channel to EVERYONE I meet. Now they have branched out and reached out to others about Adrienne. We all love you and I am excited to do this 30 day challenge for the 30th time it seems now! My advice to anyone who might feel pain or some struggle with these exercises, or even are in my situation just push through it! I had to half-perform some poses at first because of the pain but it gets better and so does your body! Namaste <3 Thank you for healing my body and my awareness !

2822.0,"Guys, downward dog/planks etc. -- poses where the hands support the weight -- are incredibly painful to me not because of an upper body strength issue or leg flexibility issue but because of my wrists. This has been true my whole life; pressing my wrists backwards has always been painful on its own, let alone supporting any weight. I end up modifying a lot of poses by pushing up on my fists etc., but then I miss the connection with the earth and the stability, plus everything up the whole arm radiates differently so the pose doesn't do what it's intended to do. I end up in a lot of wrist and forearm pain if I don't modify, but feel dissatisfied when I do.

Ideas? Yoga workouts for folks with wrist issues? Wrist flexibility exercises? Other ways to modify poses? I'm a pianist and kinda need to be low-impact, but I'm sick of my otherwise super-helpful yoga practice being interrupted by wrist pain.",Ughgac_RlYtWwngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-02-01T07:32:44Z,-0.9987757802009583

And also the back of my legs prickle as if I've got needles and pins in my leg, when I reacht the mountain pose. I don'T feel like I force myself into the positions, it's quite easy to do them.

You have a very real approach to yoga that puts you at ease. Normally I cannot stop my brain and relax into yoga, but your instructions have made it happen. I usually give up on yoga after about 5 minutes because it's so slow. Your videos seem to fly by because I'm enjoying it!

I just went through the death of a family member and have be desperately trying to heal myself emotionally and physically. I have done three of your videos and with each one I feel a little more relaxed and hopeful. When times are tough for me that's when I take control of my body and fitness because it's something that I CAN control.

3556.0,"So I was doing Yoga a couple of years ago but this was mostly just picking up some poses from the internet and trying to hold it like forever. It wasn't really satisfying so I lost track of it. I have to admit though, that feeling my body in a different way made me keep calm in a way, nothing else had.
So instead I started to focus workouts and weight training but most times you need to force yourself for that and my muscles shortened quite badly. During the last months I wasn't able to practise a lot of sports, kept sitting at home and got a bad pain in the back. So I googled Yoga again and look who I found ! 
I'm so greatful for what you do Adriene! I'm not only able to do the exercises from home, but I'm finally doing it right and feel so good doing it. It's not easy, that's for sure, but just after day two I can literally feel how happy my body is for being finally treated so well.

I work as a cashier so my back hurts a lot.

She likes to do what I do, so I asked her to try yoga. the problem is she can not sit still very long and she feels terrible when she can not get the moves exactly right. She says it hurts also. I have tried to explain to her it is stretching her muscles and while watching the video pausing it and putting her in the correct position. She does not understand the breathing or some of the words stated either. So my question is can you make a series of yoga that is fun and quick for young kids???

I LOVE your channel - it has allowed me to be consistent in my practice without having to pay or be embarrassed/distracted in classes! Seriously, thank you. I'm doing my 2nd round of 30 days this month, wahoo!
In all seriousness, I just thought of a request: I was wondering (since I was jammin in my savasana) if you would put just one track of your favorite yoga/meditation music at the ends of videos when you end in a savasana? That would be amazing!

DAY 2:

So, I'm two days late, work caught up with me and I wasn't able to do yoga. But I've just finished day two and I have my report. Well, day two kicked my ass, but I feel stronger. My back isn't struggling so hard to maintain upright (it's still work), the toe stretches and the sequences after three-leg dog just beat me into the mud. I had to take a break twice throughout the move. Shaky legs and not strong enough thighs were noticed. The rest was wonderfully fun, not too easy¬† but nothing tooo hard either. Going for a big Yoga class tomorrow, so report No. 3 is on Monday (need a Sunday break).

It's just the motivation I need to stay committed. Although, any flexibility I had gained before has definitely gone! Especially in my shoulders and my forward fold is pitiful! I know this will improve through practice. However the main benefit for me is mental. The reason I first started yoga was that I had lost track of who I was and where I was going and decided to find way to connect with myself again. (Sounds super cheesy, I know) but Yoga is helping me with that. I felt overwhelmed with emotion at the beginning of today's practice but I'm proud of myself for getting up and doing it.

4242.0,"Hi Adriene loving the 30day challenge. A quick note to all the lovely people that are struggling with these excercises. Be patient friends and take your time, pause the video if need be and enjoy whole heartedly. Also i find that if you do some basic stretches first it does help as i have arthritis in my spine, its a God send. In case your wondering i have Spondylolithisis (not sure its spelled correct lol) and the strength im gaining in the back muscles is surreal. But yes do the Yoga for begginers for a few days first, that way your body will get used to the idea of Yoga and then you should be able to take the 30day challenge. Hope this helps. But remember basic stretch excercises first to warm up the muscles and blood flow ok. Love and Light to all. Namaste xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Thank you for what you do through your online videos.

This 30 day challenge is a chance to make this more of a habit. Found day 2 a challenge but a delicious sense of satisfaction in being able to see it through. You make yoga accessible, fun but also with a sense of purpose behind it all. Always feel good afterwards. Thank you very much!!

4454.0,"Day 1 - AM yoga. Great start on a weekend. ¬†
Day 2 - PM yoga - I ran out of morning and had to wait till evening. I am now thinking that this may be a nice after work ""reset"" ritual since I already hit the gym Mon-Fri in the AM. ¬†

Wrist Advice? - I am having a regular issue with my wrists. Plank, downward dog, half cow and a few other movements that require holding your self with palms flat is killing my wrists. I find myself making fists instead of palms flat since that hurts less with the bones aligned instead of bent, but I wonder if this is 'contrary' to the energy flow vocabulary in yoga. Any suggestions?¬†

(Sidenote: I am impatient with working out and the time it eats out of my day, and I am interested in the sweat and the burn. I am still on the fence about yoga.

Worked hard to be in better shape for pregnancy and somehow got off track...sooo today's word is definitely ""challenging"". Started doing yoga with you for the first time ever a little less than a year ago and love your method, your sense of humor and your latitude. Your encouragement to listen to our own bodies has given me the confidence to get back into it and know that I am doing something good for myself and my baby even if I must modify along the way...I AM on the mat!!
