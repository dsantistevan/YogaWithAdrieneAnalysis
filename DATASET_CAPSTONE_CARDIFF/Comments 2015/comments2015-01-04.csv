There are quite a few stretches in there where you get good engagement in your core, and the stretch seems to extend from the tips of your fingers down through the feet. This really highlights the interconnection of all the parts of our body. The strength of our core flows through our backs and into our limbs.

Yoga is really the first practice since i quit martial arts as a little kid that is actually fun for me and that I feel able to consistently do, and Adriene has been a big part of that ever since my friend recommended this channel to me. I love listening to her little comments and reminders to stay mindful and what to pay attention to and focus on, because it keeps my mind engaged as well as my body and i really feel the synergy of my whole self.

327.0,"A friend recommended your online series. I'm on Day 4, and feeling good. I never liked yoga in the past because it felt so hard and I felt silly in class, when I couldn't do 90% of the movements/poses. Downward dog is so hard for me and I would get deflated because there's so much downward dog. But I'm working through it with your class and just doing what I can and not worrying if I can't do all the things. Having them be 20 or 30 min, rather than an hour totally makes me get up and do it too. Much more manageable. I've never done any exercise for 30 days in a row,  so this is new for me and I'm excited (I did take a take off when I do my weekly Pilates class, but now I'm thinking I could add it in too.

483.0,"Day 1 alone, day 2-3-4 my boyfriend joined in.
I never stick to a specific workout (always has to change or I lose interest), love high energy sports and workouts that leave you completly exhausted afterwards. I never even considered yoga as exercice for me since it is so out of my usual sports field.
He is a couch potato, never liked sports unless it is football on tv. All sports I proposed were to fast, to athletic, to much out of his mouvement comfort zone. We just do once a year a kayak day, that's all.
It might look like only 4 small days to others, but to me/us these yoga exercices might become a real success. I'm surprised how much I like it (and how much I'm not flexible at all haha). Also, it might be something we gonna continue after the 30 days as a couple which is really exciting. I'm thrilled. Finally some kind of exercice we can do together !!

Back in November I could barely walk, let alone relax, so once I committed to doing Adriene's anxiety meditation every.single.day, change happened.
Now I'm strong enough for yoga  - I can feel the change again. I'm only on day 4, but it's been 4 days since my brain fog and fatigue lifted completely. 
Thank you Adriene for changing my life. You've helped my body heal and given me a second chance at life. I honestly thought I'd be poorly forever. 
If anyone asks me how I recovered from CFS, I will simply say, 'Adriene'. 
Once I'm 100% recovered and living my 'normal' life again, I will continue to do her meditation and yoga every day.

I had to remind myself why I started in the first place and had to have a conversation with my ego- the thing that keeps knocking me off my fitness, gives me overconfidence and then destroys me over and over again.

786.0,"Ok, so this is day 4 of the 30 day challenge and let me tell you, I think yoga has been a game changer in regards to my health. In all my 21 years of life, I have never been able to do a squat. I always struggled getting my balance and I couldn't do one without being on my tip-toes (again, not a squat). I don't know if yoga has made my muscles stronger, or made me more in tune with my body (or both!), but today I went to pick something up from the floor and I subconsciously did a proper squat and I was blown away. It may sound ridiculous but to me that was enough to know that yoga is the right choice for my body and I am sad I didn't try it sooner.",UgyJHN--UUVGag0pO3p4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-06-03T21:42:56Z,-0.9733570218086243

978.0,"Thank you so much for this series, Adriene! Seeing as I'm beginning dance soon, I was looking for a way to build strength and flexibility with grace, and instead of just using several machines at the gym and benchpressing for getting lots of hard muscle, I wanted to get toned and lean muscle to have a male dancer's form. I actually have a question for you, Adriene (or any other yoga person who might be able to answer). I have back pain when moving my neck, but not lower back pain. Instead, it feels very similar to what I felt behind my knees when first doing Downward Dog, a kind of ""cold"" pain from stretching something, and it's at the top of my spine, located at the vertebrae between the top of my shoulder blades. I usually get it when I have to touch my chin to my chest (or anything of the sort), and the most intense pain I got from it was when I tried doing the Plow Pose a video ago. As soon I tried touching my feet to the ground behind me, the top of my back erupted in pain. Do you have any solutions for it? I believe it's because I'm curving the rest of my back when it should be straight, so it stretches the spine too much, but I don't know. Are there any yoga poses to help with this? Thank you so much!

1237.0,"So far I haven't left any comments yet. I've been doing this challenge for the past 4 days, but especially today I feel like I should let you know how much these videos are changing my life. The past few months I have been scratching myself in my sleep every single night. And my whole life I've been getting headaches when I'm stressed or anxious. Yesterday, I had a stressful day at work so my headache was huge when I came home. I did day 3 of the 30 days challenge, and my headache was almost gone. Now, today, I was exhausted as soon as I came home. I was already in bed, before I decided to get up again. I just really didn't want to give up day 4 and I'm so glad I didn't. Today's workout was so relaxing once again, and as I am typing this in bed, my eyes are slowly closing already. THANK YOU for inspiring not only me, but also a lot of others! It truly means a lot, Adrienne.
EDIT: I also noticed how my head can almost touch my knees again, and my heels almost touch the ground in downward facing dog! I know this might seem extremely fast for some people, since I've never done yoga, but I've always been very flexible and I'm so excited to finally being able to (almost) do these things again.

1276.0,"Hello Adriene- 
First of all, thank you for making this 30 day yoga challenge. I am not per se an expert on Yoga but I have been doing yoga for over 3 years on and off. I am pretty fit person and I use so much energy through out the day. 
Currently, I am in Japan and I work as a teacher. I teach all levels of children and I work 9hrs. My classes are different, so there are times when I am expected to teach sitting on my knees for 45mins long 3/4 times a day. Due to that and my crazy students, I am exhausted at the end of the day- I come home and I am too tired to open my eyes, eat dinner and go to bed. 

Anyways, it will make sense when I present my question to you, sorry for my long life story lol. 
I have been doing your 30 days yoga challenge for 3 days and now its my 4th day. My question is that, I try to flex, relax, and also stretch throughout the day, but in the morning I do not even feel my knees or my legs at times, because they feel like they have fallen off from standing and being on my knees all day.

I was having a multiple panic attacks a day and couldn't sleep at night. I have also had a stiff back for about 5 years, since my first son was born. I have never been very fond of yoga as I always felt a lot of pressure to be super flexible and ridiculously zen. I am so thankful to my Blogilates family for leading me to you. You are the perfect blend of funny and light hearted combined with calm and grounding. I seriously have fallen in love with yoga in just 3 days. At the end of day two my panic attacks have almost gone, and when I braced to roll up my yoga mat...the stiffness in my back was GONE. I now look forward to doing yoga every night.

1467.0,"OK - Sorry in advance for the novel but I never comment on things yet this is too important to me not to.  You'd really have know me to understand how ground breaking this is for me.  I'll be 47 the end of November and I used to do ballet until my mid teens but no exercise at all since then.  I've been fortunate to have a high metabolism I suppose or something as I've had 4 beautiful children but most would never know.  I've had arthritis in my spine since age 19, mild scoliosis, the usual Degenerative Disc Disease, 2 ruptured discs a couple of bulging discs, and then in 2011 I was in a car accident and fractured two bones in my back at L1/L2.  I didn't listen and went back to work 2 wks later not letting myself heal.  Needless to say, I've suffered chronic back pain for a very long time.  Injections, MRIs, Orthopedic doctors and surgeons, Neurosurgeons, and I was finally told ""some people just have to take pain meds every day to get by"".  I left that office in tears a year ago.  I had taken strong pain meds for years and I couldn't accept that so I stopped the pain meds in April and had just been living with the pain (not very well mind you as I only leave the house when necessary).  

I've always thought yoga would be a great way to start getting healthy - I stumbled across your Yoga for Beginners and bookmarked it at least 6 months ago - never did it - but I intended to.  Someday.  A week ago, someday finally happened.  I did it and I survived.  I found the 30 day challenge and started with that.  After my third yoga session ever, my back hurt SO bad I couldn't stand it but I *KNEW* that my body was just being forced to move in ways it should have been moving and stretching all along.  After the 4th one (day 3 of the 30 day challenge), it hit me... I wasn't hurting.  At all.  I felt good.  I wanted to leave the house - to take a shower - to do something - and I haven't had this kind of feeling in more years than I can remember.  I know I'm only just starting this (just completed day 4 for the back and it was amazing) but I can see where this is going and I like that direction so much.  I even feel like walking and baby stepping into some cardio.

Adriene - I just have to thank you for providing these videos and being so adorable, easy to follow, encouraging, but not over the top lol!  You are making this so easy for me and I look forward to my sessions.  Even considering doing more than one a day because it feels so good!  I'm getting more flexible and feel like I did back in my teens during all of those ballet and pointe classes.  I never thought I would feel that again.  I've been so worried as 2 of my kids (my 15 and 21 yr old) have been starting to have a lot of back pain.  My son has always been active with basketball in high school but now in college he's not as active and really suffering.  My daughter does all star competitive cheerleading so lots of tumble, stretching and exercise but still starting to really experience pain and I know what that feels like and never want them down the medication road.  I am sharing these with them and can't wait to see how they do.  I know they'll love you as much as I do!  

Anyway, I just felt the need to tell you that you are making an indescribable difference in at least one life.  And hopefully two young lives that can start this practice and use it for a very long time.

My boyfriend, who is a firefighter for the state of California, introduced me to your videos because he felt that I would feel healthier and happier if I infused my life with a little physical activity. This was the best gift I could have ever been given. At first, I was nervous because I have never been so out of shape in my life and was worried I was not going to be able to keep up; I've been to a few yoga classes where I had to leave half way through because it became so grueling. Your easy going attitude, fun commentary, and your focus on self-awareness helps ground me in the moment on the mat. I was so excited today that I did both day 3 and 4, thank you!!

It's really uncomfortable cuz it increases in intensity at times, not painful, though.

I was unfortunately born with scoliosis so doing simple things like sitting in an area for too long or standing for too long actually hurts my lower back. A lot of people recommended that I take some yoga class and I have done so but, I would always walk out feeling unsatisfied or discouraged. The beginners level class, even though I am flexible, turned out to be filled with professional yoges or I felt I was lagging behind due to pain in my back during class. However, with Adriene, her videos leave me proud that I am still on this challenge even though its day 4 and to top it all my lower back pains seem to be going away. Some of her videos may be 40 mins but, those 40mins fly by and by the last 2 mins of her video you feel refreshed and alive.

I find it funny that you mentionned the heels touching (or not!) the ground in downward dog. I was wondering if I was doing it right. But today for the first time, my heels lightly touch the mat! But most important, I feel GREAT!!! I feel stronger from inside and find it more easy to keep healthy and ergonomic positions while at work. And, as an added bonus, I like that you wear simple clothes. It relay the idea tha yoga IS accessible to everyone. THANK YOU!",UgheLDQhadn0EHgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2016-04-08T21:33:58Z,0.9995218515396118

I'm definitely within the age range for carpal tunnel and this is helping immensely with both my posture and extremely stiff, tight, numbing hands.  Can you explain more about how to relieve pressure on the wrists for carpal tunnel (besides your existing silent movie version) during down dogs and plank, etc. for the remainder of the 30 days?

1636.0,Hi Adriene and YWA community! I have started the 30 days of yoga and have just finished day 4. I am loving it so far. Thank you Adriene for such a wonderful resource. I have a question though - is it normal for a newbie to feel wrist pain during downward facing dog? I also really feel some positions such as the plank and the plough (?) but others such as the stretches where we move our legs to the side I don't feel a 'burn' so to speak.,Ughw4o8LKYxVy3gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-04-05T14:40:49Z,0.9996572732925415

I have a request though, if it's not too difficult, do you think you could edit in a 2-5 minute savasana extension of quiet music or just silence?

My current weight is 214 pounds and i am starting to feel slowed downed by it,and my eldest daughter whom is only ten years old seem to be getting over weight for her age also.SO a friend of mines recommended YOGA for and my daughters to do which is actually a very fun for us to work up a sweat together. My aim is to get my self fit and also to help keep my kids fit as well because i see alot of kids these days where i live in Trinidad becoming extremely over weight to the point where their feet becomes so swell that they can hardly walk or may not be able to put on their shoe size ,always have to buy shoe that are way bigger than their feet and i dont want that for my kids. If they have to be that way let them when they are adults to make their own chices but not whilst they are in my care and i can do something about it ...

1644.0,I'm so glad I've found this channel and your website. I initially took up Yoga nearly 5 years ago during my exams and had only really used it as a stress reliever during exam periods.

I had never done yoga and found Adriene's website in February. After I did a week of the complete beginner video I was hooked. I launched into Yoga Camp and haven't looked back. I have to say that Adriene is the BEST teacher. When first checking out online videos I was intimidated, had no idea how or why to ""fine tune"" some of the movements or why it made  a difference. I felt like a complete dunce and none of it was fun. Yoga is now my happy time and morning routine. Now sometimes I will randomly do downward facing dog just because it feels good. BTW, I will turn 60 this August. I hope any who think yoga is only for the young will find that age is just a number.:)",UgjV5JyrOBsB63gCoAEC,1.0,40.0,2016-03-29T17:24:21Z,0.7376812696456909

1722.0,"Adriene, I have discovered your channel at the most perfect time in my life. I am in dental hygiene school, and if ergonomics aren't followed correctly, we can do some serious damage to our neck, back, and wrists. Your videos are inspiring, simple to understand, and you don't make me feel like a dummy for not knowing what the heck I'm doing. I'm finally finding what feels good for me.

I have a question. I have had a horrible knot between my spine and right shoulder blade for over a year now. No matter how much I stretch, or massage it, it never completely goes away. I'm thinking this is just something I will have to learn to live with because I have minor scoliosis. My joints are naturally pretty flexible, so when I stretch my shoulders, I never get that satisfactory ""tug"" that I get from other stretches.

Will this get better over time as I develop my practice, or can you suggest some yoga stretches that are good for upper back pain?

1748.0,"I rarely ever leave comments on videos, but I felt compelled to share. I have been suffering from chronic back pain for years now (so bad that it was painful to take a deep breath), Doctors had been telling me that I needed to accept the ""new normal"" that I was feeling and start pain management. I knew that wasn't the solution for me, so I started doing a few yoga poses on my own during my moments of most severe pain. I looked up pinterest yoga plans, yoga youtube videos, 30 day fix plans, all sorts of beginner yoga. I started to feel discouraged because I felt even more pain than before. Then I came across this 30 day plan... I am only on day four and I can already take a deep breath without pain! I am amazed at how wonderful I feel already! Compared to any other beginner yoga videos, these have been the most awakening, informal, easy to follow, and all with a bit of humor :) The most amazing thing is that I actually look forward to morning yoga now. I will report back when I finish a full 30 days, but I already know I'm going to feel amazing. I am so glad I found your videos. Also, I'm 28 and have been battling an incurable indolent cancer for 3 years now. I can't even count how many times I have been told that the way I was feeling was something I needed to accept.

I hurt both my groins and hamstrings and all the area wth deep stretches of yin yoga and now I cannot do nothing because I am afraid of causing further damage as I continued the deep stretches despite the pain thinking it will make me more flexable the more I do holding the principle of no pain no gain in my head, so do I need to completely rest not even do any exercise routine?

DAY 4:

So, day four has arrived, it's right after day 3! Hehe, two days in a row. So today's workout was by far the easiest for me, and also the one I felt at home with. I loved the plank and downward dogs ration this time. the stretches were awesome, the Child Poses always showed up just in time to save the day. Once again, I felt this workout more of my overall body rather than my back, just like yesterday's session also seemed to work out most of my body but the belly didn't feel any aches.Again, I've come from a gym background, so if it doesn't hurt it's not working is how I was taught. If yoga doesn't do that or I'm doing the exercises wrong--I wouldn't know. My back feels a lot better than it did 4 days ago! :) Hopefully see ya'll tomorrow!",UgifG4WkzO0EcXgCoAEC,0.0,2.0,2015-02-10T04:25:54Z,0.9696369171142578

I love your videos, and the you-ness that leads us through yoga practice. I have a shoulder injury that I have noticed is aggravated by postures such as downward dog and chataranga, and in general I find ways to modify your sequences to meet my bodies needs. AND, I wonder, and hope, and request that someday you might make a sequence that's energizing and warming - but doesn't use Vinyasa positions that put stress on the shoulders. It may be a challenge, I would imagine - as Vinyasa is a great way to put heat into the body, but I wonder - and I trust you!

2148.0,"Hi Adriene!

First off, let me say how much I love your videos. I've been doing yoga consistently for five months now, which is the longest time I've exercised in a decade. I love it.

I do have one wish though. I wish that you'd join us for savasana. Since it's the most precious posture, and you want us to fully embrace it, it'd be nice if you stayed in savasana with us just for a minute or two. When the music for the end of the video comes on, it feels like I should just get up and be done, but I know I'm missing out on the benefits of savasana when I do that. If I had you doing it as well, I'd be more likely to stay in the posture.

Regardless of that small request, I am so glad I found you. You've helped me learn to love exercise, and really treasure the time I take to do yoga each day. Thank you so much for all you do.",Ugj7jX3qxky313gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-01-06T04:08:36Z,0.9991117119789124

2193.0,"I do not know if anyone else has experienced this since beginning this challenge, but I am still pretty young. 15 year old to be exact and my whole family generally has back problems. I get aches usually after being on a hard surface. But since starting this challenge, I have been stretching more muscles in my back and they have been a bit tender, you could say. Is this normal? It is just like your body adjusting to the using the muscles. They aren't sore, but just tender. For example if I was to bend over and pick something up fairly heavy, I could feel the muscles throughout my back just like saying ""you shouldn't have done that quickly""¬†",UggvJyF6Trz9OXgCoAEC,4.0,7.0,2015-01-05T17:17:07Z,0.9950857758522034
2194.0,"Hey Adriene! Really enjoying your 30 days of Yoga! I'm determined to see it through! I have Spina Bifida and walk with calipers and crutches so some of the poses are challenging but I do what I can because I love it!¬† I wonder would you ever do a video or series of videos for those who, like me are less capable of moving there legs? Maybe¬† a fully seated yoga? I'm sure people in my position, and many others could benifit! Just an idea! Love your work!

2195.0,Day 4: Started the morning with some of my mom's mushroom soup and some funny videos. After my meal I made my way to the mat to practice yoga with Adriene. I have a runny nose and that sore throat is still here but practicing helped clear all of that up. I worked up a sweat that I am grateful for. Going to take a nice hot shower before going to work. Today my intention is to take things easy and not to be hard on myself with crazy expectations.¬†,Ugj3rA-cUS79LHgCoAEC,0.0,2.0,2015-01-05T17:00:39Z,0.9737069606781006
2196.0,"I too found this day's practice exactly what I need. I have back problems as some others here and today was such a perfect practice. It added not only all the stretching I need, but some good and gentle strength building. Yesterday's practice was too much for my painful back and legs, so I did your 20 minute beginner video and felt great. So even though I may not be ready to do each day of the 30 day series, and I will try, I will at least get in a day of yoga to meet the 30 day. 

Also -- I am not getting the email since the very first one. 
Thank you Adrienne for your wonderful teaching.",UgiyO5W4GJef9ngCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-01-05T16:53:53Z,0.9983525276184082
