Thank you for practice teacher üôè With the theme of freedom and forgiveness, my goal today (and hopefully every day) will be to remember that when I meet a difficult person: they don't necessarily have conflict with me as much as they have conflict within themselves. The best thing to do for ourselves, and for them, is to let their energy flow past us. Paraphrasing Nietszche, we become like the monsters we fight. Arguing and indecision is wasted energy that requires us to take away from our own spirit and energy. Create (positivity) don't hate!

182.0,"I am a little worried to do today's practice. How I do my yoga is I do 10 minutes of morning wake up yoga and then do the 30 days video of that day. So last night was my uncle's wedding. And it wasn't a wedding you think of when I say wedding. My family is Arab. It was an Arab wedding. Which means that it was big and long and I had to look very very very fancy. So basically I got blisters on the balls of my feet from my heels. And for a lot of my favourite poses I use the balls of my feet. I have not gotten out of bed yet and tried to even walk but if I am able to walk and get to do this practice I will update this comment. Wish me luck ‚ù§

Update: I did It! It was hard and my feet hurt just a little but I did it! I'm so glad Adrienne gives variations to moves! If it were not for the variations I would have been in so much pain and given up! I'm gald I pushed myself to do it today. I told myself ""if you don't even try today you're not gonna do it tomorrow and you're just gonna stop doing yoga and your back pain is gonna come back and you'll lose *ALL* your progress!! Get up and go!"" And I did! Thank you Adrienne for all of this and all your hard work is really appreciated! Wishing you all the best!

It shows so much thought because I think many of us forget that it is okay to not be an expert right away.

I had only done a bit of yoga a few times years ago and had a mat dusting away at the bottom of my wardrobe.¬† Since beginning this journey I feel reconnected to the body and mind and went through a stage of talking about it to everyone!!!¬†DO THIS WITH ME!! ITS AMAZING!!!!¬†However, and this is not a criticism, I feel myself start to struggle though getting to the end of the videos, I feel I'm losing my stillness.¬† I feel I am getting more impatient and in turn frustrated!¬† I've just started going back to the gym, which may have impacted on my (I don't know how to put it but...)¬†'stillness'/being in the moment.¬† I find the gym¬†is¬†so vigorous and disconnected from the mind.¬† How do I get the stillness back when I¬†roll out the mat? I MISS IT!¬†Apologise if this is silly talk! Its really bothering me lol! Someone HELP ME!",Ugh9w7AwRGM9kXgCoAEC,4.0,2.0,2015-01-24T09:32:34Z,-0.9917470216751099
490.0,Really needed to work on forgiveness this morning and look what practice you set forth today! The world works in beautifully mysterious ways. Thank you Adriene. This was lovely and challenging. Namaste xo,UggykL0zxyBrsHgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-01-24T08:35:18Z,0.9998375177383423
491.0,"I did my practice super early this morning (6.50 am here in the UK, that's very early for me for a Saturday!) and really struggling with the side planks as I was feeling tight and tired (and maybe a little hungover). But then just before savanasa I snuck in another 4/5 breaths in side plank on each side, and it felt amazing! I guess that's what happens when you stop worrying about trying to do an asana, just accept where you are and just let go! Just one of the things I love about your practices. Thank you Adriene!",UgirafO2mk_-w3gCoAEC,1.0,5.0,2015-01-24T07:22:59Z,0.9991042017936707
