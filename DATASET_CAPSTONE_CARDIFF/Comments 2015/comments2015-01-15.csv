2.0,"Today I really didn't want to show up on the mat. But I did not want to ruin my 14 day streak, so here I am, in the middle of the night, doing day 15 and hating it. And then when I am in shavasana, I feel grateful for showing up. I feel great, and my hips feel really good. For fun, I decide to carefully try full lotus (have never been able to do it). First side, notice I am very close actually, am slightly amazed. Second side, still feeling great, and carefully, I slide into full lotus. I only stayed there for 2 seconds since I don't want to overdo it, but thank you. This journey is very transforming, and I feel more in touch with yoga than I have done since the beginning of the pandemic. I know this is an old video series, but it is still amazing.

55.0,"Day 15: Yoga with Adriene - Half Hour Half Moon Practice. Phew. That was an intense session. We're reminded that even without weight equipment we can still get a good workout in. This was a demanding session today. There was a lot of lunges, and quite a few warrior two poses. These awaken a good burn in the thighs and get the blood pumping. Then we come to the end and the half moon poses.  This poses are rather difficult, at least for me, being new to my yoga practice. It was a struggle maintaining my balance, and keeping 80% of myself suspended in the air while trying to open my chest and breathing. My legs wound up shaking like a magnitude 6 earthquake was happening beneath my feet. I fought through the poses and cajoled myself to follow along and keep up, in my under-dogged need for a good challenge. Being done now, with a little bit of soreness throughout my body, I'm once more happy with myself, and a bit proud for keeping up with this so far and rising to the challenge.

I was moving slow, and I have lots of homework and housework and such. Yoga felt like the first of several responsibilities I wanted to avoid. But at the beginning, Adriene reminded me to put off anything on my to do list that might get in the way (how does she always know???) and so I did. IT WAS SO WORTH IT!!!! I was just reminded today why I love yoga and why I always come back to the mat!! I had never done half-moon pose in all of my years of yoga, but Adriene made it look easy (shocker, it wasn't!) but it felt amazing to work on it, and pay attention to my body and just FIND WHAT FEELS GOOD!

78.0,"I really love what you do Adriene, but really I dont understand why you dont show us the posture first, and ask to do a hundred poses on one leg before we end up on half moon. If I knew my arm had to be up I would have put it up from the beginning to find balance (if we're here, it's most probably that we're not yoga masters), but then when you're asking us to lift the arm its too late, the posture is wrong and we'd have to start it all again to get it right...  Also I thought the block was mandatory, but when I typed half moon on Google no one uses a block... 

So yeah all that got me lost for a minute, everything going really fast, no time to focus on posture, or leave the screen, just watching and listening ""one leg up, one foot back, climb to the front, etc""... 

I'd love to do all the fancy poses arm up and down with and without blocks one day, but I guess that was a bit ambitious for a first try.",Ugza56lsQKDedL9oSzt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-10T01:20:56Z,-0.9971067309379578

I‚Äôve done the 30 days on and off for the past 4 yrs and can look back at that girl on her towel and give her a big hug for trying. My body is my home and Yoga has remodeled it.

Yet, each time Adriene reminded me that this was a playtime, a time to explore your body and stretch it out, and I found myself slowly relaxing and pushing back that frustration. I may not be able to do half-moon right now but maybe one day I can with enough practice. The rest of the practice was enough to make me sweat haha but it was a good sweat. I feel accomplished and proud of myself for sticking through with the poses even as my thighs started shaking. I just want to say to anyone who may be doubting their strength that is ok to not be perfect. Every time you come back and do your best, whatever that may be, is a time you can grow.

Nevertheless, I just went to down dog and carried on to the end. Which I suppose is the main thing!

You want me to do the harder version of the pose, sure! But today was very difficult physically. I fell a lot and got REALLY frustrated. It gave me a taste of what I‚Äôm sure it feels like for some other people who aren‚Äôt as flexible as me to come back to the mat every day. It really put things in perspective. So if you struggle on the mat every day, and come back the next one, you‚Äôre strong enough to move mountains with your mind. (I dunno, it‚Äôs a dumb metaphor I just made up, leave me alone.)

My boyfriend and I have been doing your 30 days of yoga video series and we really love it! We can't wait to start yoga camp as well. I have a question for you about this Day 15 video: 

When I tried half moon I went very easy on myself because I have some hip issues from doing gymnastics back in high school (I'm 22 now). When I started half moon with my left foot as the standing leg my hip tightened up in pain and I had to stop the pose completely. I couldn't even stand on that leg anymore! 

Do you have any suggestions for attempting poses like this when I have sensitive hips? Is there any sort of variation to this pose that I could do that will help me gain strength in that area?

As time past I stopped going weekly and then pretty much altogether. I met this guy who teaches acro yoga along with some other classes and my interest rekindled. I did not however want to pay for classes that I may or may not go to on a regular basis. 

I did a little research and found your channel, I think it's one of the better youtube yoga channels out there. I have been following this 30 Days of Yoga and have reached the half way mark. I've missed three days but made those up by following two videos the next day along with any other supplementary yoga video that I feel will help my body.

Adriene.... I want to thank you soooo much.   I've always wanted to do Yoga but could never get into it.. the instructor would be boring or the sessions would be too long.. but you are so different!  I could seriously do an hour long session with you. Once that music starts playing at the end, I say to myself, its over already? LOL 

Time surely flys with you & you are helping me make my dreams come true.
