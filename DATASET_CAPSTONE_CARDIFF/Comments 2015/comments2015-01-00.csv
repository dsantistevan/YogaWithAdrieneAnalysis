668.0,"After finishing first 30 days of Yoga I came back here to share my own experience! 
DO IT!
I loved it. I was never a ""yogi"" before this video and found most yoga classes to be boring or too demanding but Adriene really is something else.
My favorite moment in a day is coming home and rolling out my mat, my little practice-me time under her guidance! 
It is so soothing, relaxing and simply wonderful.
I am far more flexible, stronger and relaxed than I was 30 (35) days ago. There were times when I skipped the day, gave 90 %, but I kept following this amazing routine and I did not regret it.
So if you are wondering, do I have time, can I do it, do I really need it,.. my answer is ROLL OUT YOUR MAT and just DO IT!
It feels amazing.
P.S.  I am aware that it might seem as if  I am overreacting but I really am not. This changed my life and I will do it again :D   And Adriene, darling  if you ever read this, THANK YOU!!! <3

841.0,"FEEDBACK after 30 Days. I just finished 30 Days of Yoga (in about 50 days..) and I want to leave a Feedback for whomever stumbles upon this. I am a 24 year old male chemistry student, just for the record. I recommend to every human being to try out this set of yoga-videos, more so than any other yoga course, be it a group class or other youtube videos. Here's why:

Adriene's videos are an approach to modern yoga not as a universal, dogmatic and strictly defined practice, but rather a personal and individual one (""there are no rules""). Everyone is different and yoga is about creating awareness for what is going on in your body and mind, you have to develop (and you will) a feeling for what your body wants, a feeling for sore muscles and which positions relieve that soreness, a feeling for a stressed mind and how you can relieve that stress, calm down and recover your energy. Not only will you find the fitness and sport part of yoga but also the meditative aspects and the importance of mindfulness, in a simple, down-to-earth manner. This is a practical, straightforward and completely free set of videos that introduces you to what modern yoga can be all about, in my opinion.

Thank you, Adriene!",UghqfXnSsc1rM3gCoAEC,0.0,246.0,2015-04-07T13:08:26Z,0.9943293929100037
712.0,"So half a year ago, I started being unhappy about my body. I would say I wasn't fat, but I sure was a little a chubby. I hoped the puberty will repair it all, but then I decided to change. I started with pilates on YouTube and spent 5 months making myself do that two short intense videos for abs and legs. It worked. I would say I'm more toned now, but the stress of beginning school again and all that depression and sad thoughts I sometimes have, made me want to stop and just cry. I was too lazy to do that same boring exercise again and again and it somehow made me very annoyed. Few days ago I tried Yoga. I suddenly realised that for my calm, introvertal and very stressing self is the relaxing and slow Yoga MUCH better that the fast and intense workouts I've been doing. Doing Yoga is a while I have for myself, just me and the blanket. It made me be really looking towards exercising. I feel so better now!

To be completely honest with you, I've started this 30 day challenge before and I didn't manage to follow through. But here I am again! 
Two weeks ago I had the flu and it made me realise how much I miss yoga. I did your ""Yoga for when you are SICK"" routine and I let all my emotions flow. There's just something about it... Yoga leaves me feeling calm, present and happy with my own body. 
So I'm SUPER excited to give this challenge another shot. I will start Day 1 tomorrow and report back after Day 30! :-)

39.0,"Starting on 19/03/2021 (will keep updating)

(I will be documenting on @todaysyogachallenge with photos & videos too in order to feel a sense of accountability)

Day 1 (19/03/2021): As the title suggests, this was amazing at easing me back into yoga. It didn't feel difficult which already encouraged me for day 2. My relationship with yoga has always been on and off which consisted of short periods of practice.

Day 2 (20/03/2021): I definitely need to improve my form but seeing that I didn't struggle much with the planks was amazing!

Day 3 (22/03/2021): This one made me realise how poor my ability to balance is :( But the flow overall was a very soothing and empowering one!

Day 4 (23/03/2021): Completed this one in the morning right after I woke up. I feel quite energised and happy! It again didn't push me too hard which was nice.

Day 5 (24/03/2021): Completed this one at 6am (a first for me) and it really did make me *feel alive*

Day 6 (25/03/2021): I didn't know how weak I was until this one :)

Day 7 (26/03/2021): That sweet sweet point where downward facing dog is for relaxation

Day 8 (27/03/2021): Life would have been a much happier place if only I could stay in Bakasana for more than a few seconds.

Day 9 (28/03/2021): Today felt a little easier than yesterday's session

Day 10 (29/03/2021): These back to back sun salutations were great for controlling my breathing

Day 11 (31/03/2021): The spider pose felt really good even though my muscled did not let me dive deeper

Day 12 (04/04/2021): After a shameful 3-day break, this one felt so good!

Day 13 (05/04/2021): I love how Adriene keeps sticking to the basics but still adds one or two really fun, new poses to each session

Day 14 (06/04/2021): This session reminded me how the two sides of our body can be so different from each other especially when it comes to tense muscles!

Day 15 (07/04/2021): The halfway mark! I don't know if it was because I did this first thing in the morning or I am on my period, I just felt extra weak this time even though the flow itself wasn't too different from the other days in terms of energy demand

Day 16 (08/04/2021): Today's session was a short but sweet one! It felt like a great way to end the day

Day 17 (09/04/2021): Feeling the little progress I have made in terms of balancing felt very motivating today!

Day 18 (11/04/2021): I literally loved this new balance pose

Day 19 (12/04/2021): Today I finally managed to feel the soles of my feet completely on the floor during downward facing dog as a complete beginner

Day 20 (13/04/2021): To be completely honest, today's session felt a little boring but that's totally on me. I am more into the physical bits rather than the breathing harmonisation even though I know that breathing is a huge part of yoga

Day 21 (15/04/2021): This one felt a little too repetitive of previous days

Day 22 (16/04/2021): My feet were a little injured today but I am glad I managed to get myself on the mat, this flow felt very relaxing

Day 23 (17/04/2021): I can definitely feet much stronger doing all these poses compared to when I first started

Day 24 (18/04/2021): I see what you did there with the Shavasana Adriene and I loved it! I almost zoned out too much that I didn’t even notice that the screen had gone blank… Today’s session was the most peaceful one and the focus on the hips felt so relaxing

Day 25 (19/04/2021): It’s nice that Adriene recommends things to do to finish off the practice but I feel like as the challenge comes near the end the practices are getting unnecessarily short :/",Ugwi-4dswu4f8LoSFnV4AaABAg,1.0,3.0,2021-04-19T16:08:35Z,0.8648032899867778

614.0,"So...I finally decided to white a comment:D
Months ago I was wery unhappy and had a very stressful life, plus I was dissatisfied with my body.
One of my friends recommended yoga and the ""Thirty days of yoga"" was the first video I founded on youtube.
I started to do it every day, and in the first few days I didn't like it, it was hard, I remember that after the third day I wanted to finish the whole yoga thing, because it ""took my time"" and I thought it was stupid and useless.
But for some reason I decided to carry on, so I didn't miss a day.
And I think I was around Day 10 when a felt it...how good yoga is.
It really makes me happy, and I was so stupid when I thought it took my time, because it gave me time for myself.
""Take time for yourself"" became my favourite line from Adrien, I always smile when she says that:)
Because no matter what, you can have a lot of stress because of school or workplace, but you NEED time for yourself, to get know your body, and after practices just lay there on the ground and rest for a few minutes.
So thank you Adrien! You have given my life back, what's more, you've given me a happier life, now I'm totally satisfied with my life and there are no words how much I love you because of it^^♥
And sorry for my bad English, I'm Hungarian:)

56.0,"I just finished this 30 day series, but I wanted to come back to this first video and leave this comment for anyone debating starting it. It's worth it. Do it.
I started this journey as a way to get some routine back in my life. Between the pandemic, moving to a new country, and entering a PhD program, there have been many stressful situations which leach virtually all motivation. Getting up every morning for a quick yoga session has improved my daily motivation and energy immensely! Also, before starting this practice, I was regularly having multi-day stressed-induced migraine/headaches (I know, it's a mouthful). I did have to take a few days off at the beginning of the 30 days due to such a multi-day migraine, but I jumped back into it and since then, the migraines that have appeared were less severe and were contained to a day. I attribute this to these daily yoga practices, loosening tight muscles, some toning, and mindful breathing. That's celebration worthy in itself!
Essentially, this yoga series has been monumental to getting me back in the swing of things mentally and physically. I am so grateful to Adriene for sharing her practice with us!",UgzEHz4u_-RRStaHUTh4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-12-20T09:53:06Z,0.9975879192352295

315.0,"After many years of trying to find a yoga class to suit me I eventually ditched my weekly takeaway and hired a personal yogi to come to my house.  She is fab, but I can only afford one class a fortnight and I was instantly forgetting all the poses the minute she walked out the door!  She recommended Yoga with Adriene and I haven't looked back.  I love this woman's energy and I've been doing yoga every morning now for a month.  


I haven't had a class for 3 weeks because my teacher is on holidays, and I really can't wait for her to come back and see how much I've progressed. My posture has improved vastly and I'm so much more aware when I'm slouching.  My muscle tone is improving and my energy levels are higher.  I take things like the breathing and the neck stretches and incorporate them throughout my day.... it's easy and it feels so natural.  My silhouette is improving and I'm even making better decisions with what I eat (starting with the forsaken takeaways haha!)  finally I'm beginning to believe that I'm worth taking care of.


I'm also vacuuming more often as I'm down on the floor.... a lot :) so I have a cleaner house too!

Now back in UK, locked down, I'm on a different journey of study, and looking inwards. There is always something new to learn ..

147.0,Like many other people I came across #30dayofyoga with Adriene whilst marooned working from home during Coronavirus Lockdown. This is a fantastic way to start the day. I'm on day 15 out of thirty and I can already notice a difference and feel more toned. I do usually go to yoga classes twice a week but I feel that this 30 minutes everyday before I login to all the tech has been invaluable in making me more centred and a practice that would be beneficial to continue. I've circulated the links and recommended to a number of friends and colleagues who say they need to do more exercise at this surreal time but they don't know where to start.

With the help of her videos, I’ve increased my practice to almost every day (except weekends). I’m super excited to start my first 30 day challenge today. I hope to finish in about 40-50 ( I have a few trips planned this month and sometimes you just need a break from a routine).

409.0,"Hey Adriene.

I'm a dude from London, UK and I've been doing the 30 days of yoga. I finished day 20 earlier today.

Interesting outcome for myself. I am so bad with allergies, pet allergy, hay fever, dust, you name it id probably have it. However, since I started your programme I haven't had a single day of any allergy whatsoever. That's crazy because the last year or so I've been living on allergy pills.

I had no idea this would happen. I didn't change my diet, I didn't change anything in my life other than start your 30 days of yoga.

And it can't be a placebo affect because I had no idea about curing allergy's or illness through yoga. I only started yoga because I wanted to strengthen my core, stabilise my body before I start intense workouts.

That's crazy, did you know yoga can cure allergy's? If not, it works.

Thank you! I'll be sticking with yoga waaay longer than 30 days. That's for sure.

Thank you thank you thank you.

A tip to those just starting: consider keeping a journal of how you feel everyday after your practice.  On my first day I noted stiffness in my lower back and dull pain in my right hip when I extended my legs.  My first week I had difficulty with balance poses.  Within a few weeks these issues I've had for years are gone- no joint pain, no back stiffness, no difficulty stretching or bending.  Still working on my balance poses and seeing improvement in that, too.  Keeping a journal helped me see the gradual change in my physical strength and flexibility and the emotional benefit of a daily practice. I wake up looking forward to my time for me.

621.0,"Hi Adriene, I'm writing to comment on your 30-day series. I am on day 27 and have enjoyed it very much. I really appreciate your emphasis on listening to my body, taking care, and doing what feels good - I just can't have too many reminders! The one thing I find I'm wanting in this series is a little more continuity between the harder poses. For example, I loved the half moon practice day,  but it would be nice to return to that a few days later in the videos to keep building on it. I did this on my own, but I think your series would be stronger if there were more invitations to return to the challenging balance and strength poses. It seems like you wanted to keep the videos a little shorter so that people would be able to fit them in to a busy schedule, and change it up so it's interesting, and I understand those factors. This is just my personal experience with the series. I was surprised how much I needed to work on a few of the harder poses (I've been practicing yoga for quite a while and work on a farm, so am generally strong), and it would have been nice to return to them in later practice sessions. Other than that, I totally love your style and really appreciate being guided so beautifully. Thank you for offering these videos for free, it has definitely made my life better.
Best wishes,

630.0,"Adriene, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. For a long time, I've wanted to try my hand (feet?) at yoga. I'm not out of shape, per se, but I am not flexible AT ALL and very self conscious bout my body and my abilities. I am a runner, I lift weights, but I've been craving something more relaxed. Every time I tried to find a beginners yoga on youtube, I would feel... intimidated or discouraged. No one would ever tell me 'its okay' when I wasn't able to keep up or do what was shown. Or the moves in this beginning practice would be out of my range and just too difficult and I would think ""THIS is for beginners!? There's no way I can do this!""Then I found you <3THANK you so much for being so understanding in your videos and for acknowledging that there are many skill levels. But mostly for grasping that beginners need to ease into things, not just physically, but mentally as well. I just started your 30 day yoga challenge and felt constantly encouraged by your personality. You come across as a very real person with your humor and charm. You take the time to acknowledge your viewer and remind them that its okay to be at whatever skill level they are in, and to be aware and accepting of whatever it is they are feeling in the moment. Your yoga videos are the first I've tried that make me feel self aware and actually make me feel GOOD about the progress I could make if I keep at it. I love that your starting videos truly do ease into things. It doesn't scare me off; I actually feel like I can slowly progress and eventually tackle more challenging yoga in the future. I will definitely be subscribing to you and hope to complete all of your videos in the future, and, dare I dream, be able to do more challenging positions down the road :) Thank you, thank you, thank you!",UggK0uinNR286ngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-02-10T14:42:09Z,0.9962643980979919

748.0,"I am a 38-yr-old mom with a genetic disease called A.S. It causes the spine and sometimes other joints to fuse and cause other problems and a lot of pain. Onset is in the 20s and 30s and both my father and brother also have A.S. My onset was in my mid-twenties and I have practiced yoga on and off since then as it is really the only thing that gives me any long term relief. That said, after a difficult pregnancy and delivery 2 1/2 years ago that left me with a lot of chronic pain, I ignored my yoga practice. I leade an otherwise very healthy lifestyle now, having recently lost 50 lbs, eating mostly Paleo, and am committed to reducing toxic load and increasing wellness through natural tools like essential oils, but I really need to be more active. My doctor recently gave me a wake-up call when he told me that if I don't move, I will likely not be able to walk when I reach my father's age (my father led a very active life and is doing fairly well despite a lot of fusing). I began the 30 day Yoga Challenge yesterday and I just had to write and say that I have been to a lot of yoga classes and done many yoga videos. This is by far the one I connect with the best of any I've done in nearly 20 years of practice. Adriene has a way about her, a gentle flow and clear knowledge of the practice of yoga that transfers easily to her students. I feel that in just two days with Adriene, I have achieved a deeper practice than I have in 20 years. Adriene somehow seems to suggest exactly the right modification or remind me of exactly the thing I need right when I need it. I am finding a peace with my body that I haven't known since I was a teen. The pain is no longer central for me but something to connect with, make peace with, and know I can work through to a healthier body and soul. It doesn't own me anymore.

774.0,"I love this so far! I have been wanting to practice yoga for as long as I can remember. I have found other videos and apps because I just don't have the money for studio time. I really do not even know how I came across this series but I am SO happy that I did. I really take the ""make your own rules"" thing seriously. I started day one and then went on vacation for a week and when I got back I just started back over with day one. I have missed a few days but I haven't let that discourage me because the initial try was so great and rejuvenating. Adriene is very positive and encouraging. I love that she tells you to do what YOU want instead of making yoga something that has to be done a certain way. This is a special gift and I couldn't wait another day to do the next video so I did Day 4 and Day 5 in one day! I just LOVE it.

782.0,"Hi Adrienne! How are you? So I've been having Yoga classes for a month or so now but was having a hard time trying to practice at home without guidance. I have classes two times a week so it's a little difficult for me to memorise all the Asanas and put them in a flowing sequence by myself. I'm gonna start your 30-day series tomorrow which I think is going to be super helpful and fun! I still don't feel like having enough strength and endurance, even though I work out daily at the gym. Sometimes I feel like putting too much effort in only one part of my body while in a position and I think I was supposed to balance the strength and tension but don't know how. Maybe it's my limited flexibility. Have you any tips on muscle endurance, such as nutrition, breath or concentrarion advice? Thank you and keep it going!

840.0,"I am on Day 9 of 30 Days of Yoga! I am more than happy that I started this journey and more than thankful that you take the time to offer your videos to the public. In this short amount of time, I have already began integrating yoga into my day with easy effort. For awhile, it was hard for me to come to my mat. Last year, I started yoga in the late summer because I get terrible tension headaches from sitting at a desk all day! But in October, I had to have a small lump removed from my breast (no big deal, just hormonal!) and I couldn't practice for over a month. I sat and meditated but eventually the busy holiday season came around and I started neglecting myself. BUT last month, my sister noticed my struggle and she suggested your videos :) Your email is such a blessing in my inbox!! I get so excited to practice with you and it didn't take long for me to find out that yoga is a priority for me, not an option.

Your videos are very inviting and not intimating at all so here I am. I've attended a Zumba class for the past three years. My family relocated from Texas to Northern California and through the process of the transition I've lost my Zumba groove and my class :( I have purchased a couple of DVD's to do at home but find myself wanting something more relaxing and involves stretching as well and strengthening. I'm 51 years old and feel that I need to be kind to my body and keep it from tensing up into a ball as I age. Hoping to do your ""30 days of Yoga"" starting today. May I ask how does Yoga benefit your body and if it is as good as a workout as bouncing around getting sweaty? I loved that Zumba was a good cardio workout. Will I benefit the same doing Yoga?

I would love to take this yoga challenge on even though I am a month late. However, I have osteoporosis so what poses should I avoid? I don't wish to cause myself injury. I really do have to be very careful because I don't want to end up with vertebrae out of place or collapsed and such.  

Also I have a thyroid issue so I was wondering what poses may be good for an under active thyroid?

927.0,Today I wrote a blog on my natural healing page for facebook (Alkalize - Detoxify - Regenerate Your Body!) about creating elevation habits.  I set the intention for myself to create a daily yoga routine along with meditation.  I finished my blog which stated I would be doing yoga for the next 30 days.  I closed facebook and had a page open from somewhere.  This video was on the page.  Synchronicity and the power of intention blows me away every time.  Thanks for putting this together.  I shared your series on my blog.  <3 ~Debs  ,UgggXirVLBtTOHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-01-28T17:01:07Z,-0.9356657266616821

1005.0,"Adriene,

I have always felt so intimidated by the beautiful people always pictured in various yoga poses. THANK YOU for making yoga light, friendly, fun and do-able! Your approachable manner is so perfectly what I needed to get started. I've been practicing yoga with your videos for over a year now and have been looking forward to this 30 day challenge ever since you announced it....I even persuaded a friend to join up as well! Thank you for bringing it to the people! :-)

Quick question...any advice on yoga mats? Mine (a starter) is getting pretty ratty after over a year of yoga so I need to invest in a good one. But there are so many out there, it's tough to know what to look for. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!
