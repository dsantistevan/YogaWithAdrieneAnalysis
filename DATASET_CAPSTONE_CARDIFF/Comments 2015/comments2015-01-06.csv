2.0,"Loved this 16 minute sequence. After doing MOVE for 30 days in January 2022 for the very first time, I don't want to give up YOGA now that I have started, as it is a part of my everyday routine before heading out the door and also a few nights before going to bed. I have been  exploring  the so many YOGA with Adriene practices, and I discovered this one today. Loved working the core.  Core work is essential has helped with my lower back and posture and I am getting stronger everyday. I have so much to learn when it comes to YOGA. Thank you Adriene from Australia. xx",Ugxql_VOKurIO6Fn7yt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-14T03:59:06Z,0.9994169473648071

61.0,"I had a pretty severe shoulder injury that I attempted to ignore for over a year which finally ended me up in the position I'm in now.  After going to physiotherapy I learned how important static stretching and resistance training are but I was still missing something.  One day I woke up and couldn't move my neck due to the strain caused by my shoulder injury.  I always thought yoga was lame but in this moment of desperation I decided to do a youtube search for beginner yoga.  Day 1 Just Ease Into It was what popped up so I decided to give it a go.  It hurt, I couldnt balance myself and kept falling over, I was shaking, cracking, popping, and wondered if I was doing more harm than good.  After the 30 minutes I got up and realized I only had a bit of residual pain in my neck.  After doing Day 1 a few more times I noticed a pretty extreme change in my body.  I could balance better, the cracks and pops lessened, I was doing the full planks into upward dog with no issues.  I tried doing Day 2 and Day 3 a couple times but my body just enjoyed really crushing Day 1 so I just stuck with that for a couple years.  I would do Day 1 a couple times a week or any time I was experiencing neck pain and it kept me able to continue my resistance training and keep my physical job.  

Fast forward to now and I have finally made it to Day 6, 2 years later haha.  I think I may have found my next hurdle as I could not complete a lot of these movements.  My inner thighs are seriously straining, I can feel the extreme tightness of the muscles as they bounce off the bones.  I hear pretty nasty pops and cracks in my hips and knees in moving the core in ways it hasnt been moved in a long time.  As someone who is on their feet for 10 hours a day I know I've built up a lot of tension in these areas that needs to be addressed.  This video really outlined that for me.  I'll give Day 7 a try tomorrow but I'm definitely going to come back to Day 6 many times on this long journey of healing.

Thank you Adriene you really changed my life

I was suicidal at the lowest point of these physical issues I've been dealing with and I really needed to just ease into recovery.  People don't understand that just a single injury to a certain part of the body can effect your entire body and how it operates.  I told my doctor that I have hip, knee, and ankle issues on my left side due to the shoulder injury and he told me that's impossible.  When doing certain poses in these videos I can FEEL the tightness all the way through the shoulder, neck, side body, into the hip, into the knee, into the ankle.  After a year of neglect I could feel all of these same issues starting to enter the right side of my body as well.  Only with these poses and full body stretches can you slowly begin to heal your entire posture and get relief from the initial injury.  The point I'm at now I can finally feel a full body connection that I haven't felt in a long time.  A nice mix of strength training, static stretching, dynamic stretching, cardio, and yoga is what got me here.

I can stretch my shoulder out all day long and yes that helps, but if the side body is tight it's only going to pull on that injury and agitate it further.",UgyUfI3s1nx_CrPoABZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-07-16T18:12:39Z,-0.2994700360544719

Second question, is there any way to fix this issue? My ab muscles are fine, but that deep uncomfortable crack makes me nervous (it happens mid-spine).

91.0,"Day 6: Yoga with Adriene - SIX PACK ABS. This session is that session. This is the one that makes you seriously question why you're doing this. This is the session that has you asking yourself pose after pose, movement after movement, just why you're still following along. But hang on to those questions and reflect on them after the session, because you will certainly get through this one. This is a difficult session. Slow burn of the abdominal and groin muscles. Lots of time spent engaging the core and moving slowly through different poses and motions. People don't often realize that slow movement through poses where muscle groups are engaged can build strength as effectively, if not more, than lifting weights or other intensive training routines. This session, targeting the core, will benefit your yoga and body because the strength of the body is the strength of your heart and the strength of your core. Thanks for another fantastic session Adriene! Namaste.",UgzRrJLU2G_Likzk6Z54AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-04-07T04:52:51Z,0.9954236149787903

I have been practicing yoga for the past 3 years, I am almost 64 and my chronic back pain is gone.  It is amazing. I try not to push yoga on people when I hear them complaining, as I use to do. but it is such a wonderful life changing practice.  When people tell me they don't have the time, I tell them I only do 20 to 35 minutes a day and it has totally changed my  life and  my body.

Then I get to today, where I was pretty much unable to do any of it except the cross legged parts, so not only am I frustrated, but I didn't get a work out.  I can not hold my legs up together like that, which kind of made the whole thing impossible.  I really wish she'd show modifications,  especially as she says it's for 'all levels' but not all levels can stick their feet up in the air and crunch...and pretty much the entire video is that.   Argh.   That's the other thing I've notice as a beginner classes and here, it's better, at least for me, if there is a variety.

 I'm a cheerleader and one of my biggest insecurities related to cheer (besides not being pretty and all that kinda stuff) is my lack of flexibility. Like my legs are longer than my legs by like over 6 inches and could barely touch my toes with ONE HAND like with my leg to the side. And I stretched afterwards and guess what??????? After only 7 days, I can touch one hand AND my index finger to my toes (with my legs to the side)

It's not that big of a deal to most people, but I legit almost started crying and called my mom and like proudly screeched into the phone for like 3 minutes before she said she couldn't understand me and we would talk when she got home lol.

I was a little afraid of this day because I always had this image of myself not being able to do more than like 10 crunches if my life depended on it, but focusing on my breath and really controlling the movement made it easier for me. I only had to take a little break during that last scissoring bit, but other than that I was actually able to push through.
I can't stress enough how thankful I am for you and your videos because they don't just make me feel more relaxed and like I'm doing something for myself and my body, but they actually give me little moments like this, that make me kind of proud of myself.

I used a ponytail holder for the last prop and I have never felt more of an ab burn while really feeling like I am working the muscles and in control of everything else. I've also come to realize that a good core strengthening workout can be done slowly and with focus and control and be just as effective as 12 reps of the movement which tends to get desperate and floppy near the end.

Just wanted to ask about the leg raises. When I lower me legs on my exhale, I breath out with a long deep breath.  But when I need to raise my legs on my inhale, my breath is short and I end up holding my breath the majority of that move. Is this something that changes with time and practice or is there something amiss here?

1514.0,"At least my shoulders didn't ache - stomach - well had to adapt a bit as couldn't hold the pike position but did them with my knees bent feet on floor. I also heard yesterday - think this is fitness thing - on Britain's Best Back Gardens that a nurse of a lady who suffers from arthritis told her to garden 5 mins. a day and you should have seen her garden. So as mine is so Bob I am knocking ten mins off my treadmill and doing something in my jungle of a garden. You see yoga has opened my mind to other avenues of fitness. :)  Now where's that calender??????    :D

1520.0,"Hi Adriene! I was wondering how you go about designing a 30 day yoga challenge. How do you plan which types of practice to do when? And how do you structure your month so that it progresses? 
Also, for videos, how many do you film in one go (day)? Do you film multiple takes of each video or do you rely on the multiple cameras and planning the practice for the one take? ",UghhQJCLdmEAUXgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-01-07T18:01:52Z,-0.9950227737426758

They are the perfect warm up/check in with the body before I start my day or move on to the next video (usually from the weight loss or vinyasa flow series)
Are there going to be a few more vinyasa flow videos this year?
