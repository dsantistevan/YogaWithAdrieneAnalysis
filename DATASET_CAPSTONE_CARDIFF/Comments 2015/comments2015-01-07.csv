2.0,"Adriene it is like ages i tell you that you hold too hard positions too long, like side plank, this CAN BE HARMFUL to people who are not use to. I nearly collapsed at the end of side plank. Reflect on this. I know im the voice out of the choir. And no, telling people to skip it is not valid, because you know that 98% of followers arent yoga practitioners... so there is no point to HOLD side plank THAT long if you know people struggle to achieve it.. also im no expert, but they tolto me some yogapositions are not for holding more that 3 or 4 breaths. I counted 15 on that side plank......",Ugx-EtzreM7pj3FA5vV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2022-02-17T18:45:11Z,-0.9988365769386292

I'm happy I came onto the mat, and I'm going to continue the 30 day challenge, but today I woke up with my head absolutely riddled with anxiety, and keeping my breath steady was impossible. The side plank got to me, and even the few poses before that made me doubt myself. I can never seem to get the plank into lunge right without having to shift my entire body.

I came into this session unfocused, feeling sore from yesterday, and feeling bloated and uncomfortable with myself. Here I am though, at the end of today's session and proved myself tougher than my day, tougher than day 7, and tougher than I thought I was.

Basically I feel like on a rocking boat/dock when not moving and feel like I'm in a bouncy house when I walk. So yeah, balance has been a challenge of late. I'm happy to report that so far I've been able to keep up with each session! I wasn't sure how it would go for me but so far so good! I do have a question though, ever since high school I've had issues with my wrists. I'm finally able to do plank without pain but the side triangle pose kills my wrists. There are some other poses that twinge them too but that side triangle was intense. Any recommendations for an alternate pose or how to get my wrists a bit stronger? Thank you for all you do!

I appreciated the intensity of this workout because I had a lot of junk in my mind today that I really couldn't get out.  But once the intensity increased with the knees to elbows, I momentarily forgot about it all. One powerful thought that I was reminded of today was from the Tao Te Ching, where it talked about how great things like grass growing and stars moving all happen gradually and in silence. With these practices, the fact that so many of us are suddenly enjoying downward dog from gradual practice, and how I feel a difference already really made me understand that message deeper.

613.0,"I am having massive problems with some most of the positions, I know I shouldn't think I can do them perfectly, but to be honest, I do not know how to do them not perfectly? Can I slouch to make it easier? Or bend my knees? Just one, or both? Few examples - 
My thigh hurts and shakes and gives up when I am in forward fall. My hands are nowhere near the ground with straight legs, back is not straight, if I bend my knees so I can touch the ground with my hands, my legs shake and I can't las a couple of breaths.
I've been doing yoga for about 6 months, at least 3 times a week, short practices.
I realised my arms are very short, so when I am in plank, and my foot is supposed to step up to lounge, I am having big problems with fitting it under myself, so I have to list one arm off the floor to make space for my leg, and then my whole body collapses on the top of my leg (my knee touches my chest/shoulder). 
I'll keep at it, anyway, I love how I feel afterwards, I'm just frustrated after some practices, wish Adrienne would sometimes mention an easier position, so I don't get discouraged... hope I am not alone!

I am thankful that I can do yoga from my home without having to go to a class. I don't think that I would have ever tried it if that had been the only way that I could do it. It is challenging.

I found your videos in the right time for me when I really needed to work on my inner self and my mind. I had some tough times and meaningless sweaty jumping was the last thing I needed. I wanted to enjoy life and to find happiness and relax my mind. You showed me that you can find joy in working out and find inner peace and happiness.

I could not do the side plank for long on each side and I fell every time. But I refused to give up, I wanted my body to just do the posture at least for a few seconds. I can't even lift my leg up and place it in between my palms from downward-facing dog. I have to release from the pose and put my foot there before a warrior pose for example. But I try as hard as I can, and the foot slowly but surely ends further and further up!

I have never noticed such positive changes in my body until I started doing ONLY your classes. I have found a few yoga instructors in LA who, also, do your classes online whenever they're at home and want to have their own practice with an instructor.

But, if it starts to get so hard so I cannot do it, then I'm going back to day one and work my way back to day 6 or whatever and take my added strength, flexibility, and endurance and hopefully go further.

1332.0,"For those who are struggling with the Plank ( not only in this video , but generally ) : one of the tricks is that the mind gives up FASTER than the body, so actually you have to completely shut your brain off and just concentrate on your breath; because in the second you think "" I can't hold it anymore "" is the second you actually collapse, but if you focus on your breath, then you increase your maximal potential to hold the plank, because your body will hold on to it much longer than your brain would "" think "" ( the plank is such a great analogy for the body intelligence ) 

Also , for the wrist hurting : be mindful to really keep your arms as vertically as possible, so that your weight is placed on the CENTER of your palms; don't let your wrist to bend, because that causes the hurting. The arm has to be perfectly aligned with the forearm, elbow and palms, otherwise it will hurt.",Ugh0UP7e2at-5XgCoAEC,20.0,1431.0,2016-03-20T19:10:23Z,-0.9894054532051086

found my peace towards the end of the practice and tried to make the best of day 7.
my bedroom had candles and it is late at night, i wrapped up in a blanket at the end and i thought about my struggles with today's practice and i let them go.

I start my 6th year of college tomorrow and i know that is why i was frustrated with today's practice. I am feeling very anxious about this new year and i have not has the best energy around me lately, sending positivity into the universe at the end of this practice in hopes it will change!

Im so used to pointing my toes all the time and turning out, but I feel like with yoga it's a little less strict. I know it probably doesn't matter that much, ""find what feels good,"" right? Just wondering if anyone has any tips on this.

Also, I take medicine that constricts your blood vessels a little bit (it gives me raynauds syndrome sometimes), and often I see spots for maybe 30-45 seconds after I stand up from poses on the ground. I don't usually feel dizzy or lightheaded, but sometimes I do for a few seconds.

DAY 7:

Holy god was this work out intense! Are you punishing me for saying yesterday was too easy? Adriene! Peace! Lol. Despite my whining this was an awesome, and yes, for me a pretty testing work out. The whole kissing scene from downward dogs was brutally fun. And I did a sideways plank for the first time in my life! I held the right side-plank for about two breaths shorter than Adriene, and the left side was a wobbly mess that stayed at most ten seconds. Overall, if there's one big message I've taken away from my 7-days here, it's that my left side is inflexible and weak. I'm sweaty, thirsty and happy. Time for water and a shower!

1818.0,"This one really got me warm! And I'm getting stronger - I can almost do a proper vinyasa now.
I have a question though - how long do you normally spend in shivasana at the end of practice? I'm used to led classes where the teacher brings us out at the end.",Ugi_IZ9MM0mlF3gCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-01-08T13:50:45Z,0.9912269711494446

1821.0,"I only just realised that despite having been a fan of your videos for quite sometime, I have never left a comment saying just how thankful I am. I was a beginner when I first began watching and now am able to also attend advanced yoga classes at my local gym and it's all because of your videos :) starting yoga has allowed me to connect more to my body, and I've become a lot calmer and less irritable. I regularly practice yoga for two hours a day or more (most of the time before sunrise when I can take time away from thr stresses of the day, and I am really greatful for that. Also, your yoga for butt and thighs video is kick ass and I regilary repeat it twice or three times, but I was wondering if you have any plans to film a longer yoga for butt and thighs video? (I feel rude just asking that). Thanks so, so much and have a beautiful rest of your day :) oh and really random but you totally reminded by of a young Sandra Bullock in this video haha.
