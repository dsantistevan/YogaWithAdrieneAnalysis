My aches and pains are gone and my body and mind feel amazing.  It has certainly helped get me through this crazy time, which has also benefitted my family while we're all stuck at home.  Still building my strength and getting to know my body - but I'm so grateful to have Adriene's soothing voice and calming suggestions to help.

I started doing the 30 day challenge to help with my PMS and some anger that has been coming up for me as of late. I haven't been feeling good about how I have been reacting to situations, was feeling negative and quick to react in a frustrated way.  Im finding yoga good with moving these emotions through the body. Day 12, I am feeling more centred and calm. The breath work has really been helping. My intention is to create new behavioural patterns of being centred and I am definitely feeling that these intentions have started to take root in the mind and body.

I did practice a little early today along with the 6 min ab workout (that randomly auto-played after this session) and so I feel okay. I think the most difficult things today were the choices I had to make in terms of saying no to people, choosing not to eat a slice of Tiramisu (I'm not against eating it but I used to eat it too often haha), going to practice versus going out late to drink with friends and party up. Physical health is really a commitment, and it's becoming a little bit easier for me to pick myself after all the years of choosing others over me because I distracted myself from doing the hard work of self-improvement.

I told him I did yoga all through my 30's (I'm close to 60 now) but stopped because class was too expensive at the time.  He suggested trying it again online.  You were teacher #3 that I tried and you are by far the best teacher I've EVER had (including the teachers from my younger days)!  Doing the 30 challenge now and each day my back is stronger and I'm in quite a bit less pain.  Thank you so much!   You're a gem!  Truly!

I feel like this is the first type of exercise that when I finish it I feel like I've gotten more than I've given.  I feel like it recharges instead of drains my batteries like most every other exercise program I've tried.  Therefore I have no issue with motivation to do it - I just want to, so no pep talk necessary.  And with it being every day, I never feel pressure to really push hard and fail and get discouraged.

i haven't felt truly content/happy since i was in high school (im 24), and it was like it hit me that that feeling was me being content/happy. that wanting to exist in a space forever was an indication of happiness. and then 2 giant tears fell and i just sat there with these gentle happy tears. i dont think i would have realized what to connect that feeling to if not during this session.

521.0,"Dear Adriene,

I started this yoga challenge a few days before the new year. Though I've never been a sucker for resolutions, I told myself that this year I wanted to be more active and to be more in tune with my body and spirit. I'm committing to 20-30 minutes of SOME kind physical activity daily. I figured why not try something I could grow to actually enjoy, that way it won't feel like exercise. I've always admired the practice of yoga, but I never made any real effort towards it. I'd always end up laughing at myself either because of how out of shape I was or simply because I wouldn't take it seriously. But somehow, I've just completed day 12 of this journey and something in me just knows I will make it to day 30 (and when I do, I'll do it again!). It really is insane when you start to notice the progress you and your body are making. I don't know if I would be so far along in this journey if I had clicked on any other yoga instructor's page! Adriene, you make it okay to laugh at yourself and to not take things too seriously. I mean, name another yoga instructor who shamelessly delivers such cheesy jokes! Thank you for bringing such light and energy and fun to your yoga videos. Thank you for giving us options as learners. Thank you for your daily words of encouragement. You are appreciated. See you in the comments section on day 30 :)",UgxfODepSJNG1aiYgEp4AaABAg,0.0,74.0,2018-01-11T07:52:04Z,0.9926663041114807

758.0,"Just wanted to say hello and thanks for putting yourself and your yoga out there for us. I started doing yoga many years ago, but actually put the physical part of the process into the over-thinking at the beginning of March. I had the video of the 20 minute beginner session saved on my computer for ""when I got around to it.""

Getting around to it for me meant finally coming to the realization for the need of a self-efficacious daily process for my health; revealed by an empathetic process wrapped up in the drama of an office narcissist. Beginning my yoga practice actually set forward the processes that I spent four years studying in college and will continue to study in whatever form makes the most sense going forward (graduate school, culinary school, dog walking school, Zen and the Art of Honda Maintenance, whatever...). I have a psychology degree. And I work in a psych lab. It's a strange working environment, to say the least; but when the medical doctor, from India, who handled the lab with grace and ease, recommends you undertake a yoga practice to deal with the currently (at the time) frazzling empathetic sensitivity ‚Äì a gift that led you to the profession in the first place ‚Äì you listen....

Anyway, I wanted to say thank you for being a part of the transformation into the human that I am becoming. I now embody first hand experimental evidence in a fresh yoga practice in one's early 30s. I would now feel more inclined to recommend a yoga practice to a (potential) client if I end up undertaking the whole counselor track that I'm thinking about.

So, I've learned this: Just keep showing up. That's all you gotta do. And don't forget to laugh.

So, thanks. And I thank everyone else too. And I thank myself. Okay, bye.",UggiIgbIHEtgO3gCoAEC,0.0,11.0,2015-06-03T16:10:47Z,0.9938761591911316
