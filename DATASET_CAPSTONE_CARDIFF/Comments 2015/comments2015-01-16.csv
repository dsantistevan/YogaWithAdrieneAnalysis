Perhaps they are overweight, and cannot lean forward or do some of the moves at all. Perhaps they have a physical disability, and can’t do any of the moves properly. And there are probably quite a few other situations that can lead to anger and rejection. Please explain to your fans that what they need to do is except whatever it is they are having difficulty with. If they are overweight, if they are out of shape or if they’re disabled. Or if they have an injury.

I used to take yoga in highschool (5 years ago) and I overcame my depression by meditating everyday and really finding myself in the daily yoga practices. My instructor really spoke to me and was the kindest, goofiest woman. But I haven't done yoga in many years and after breaking my wrist and being unable to do so many things for many months, I found myself needing to reconnect with my past self. So I started this challenge on whim and haven't stopped since. The first few days I could barely keep up, and now I was able to do the side plank on my healed wrist and I didn't struggle! I feel amazing. My wrist feels so good and strong. I had been so scared to lift and do things with my healed wrist, but not anymore. I look forward to building strength in it, seeing what I can. It feels so good to be connected back to the breathing, to the daily practice. I look forward to my daily yoga everyday after I work, I get so excited to see what you have in store for me everyday. Adriene, I seriously can't thank you enough. You are so similar to my yoga instructor from highschool, so this feels all the more special for me.

246.0,"Been working through this series slowly as I try to keep my yoga schedule regular. Like a lot of people, I picked it back up due to the quarantine. Yesterday I did Day 15. I already wasn't in a healthy state of mind, and I couldn't seem to let go of it during the session. Usually I'm okay if I fall out of a move: I can pick myself back up and refocus on the position. For some reason, I couldn't hold the half moon pose (I usually do a similar pose when I'm bored). I just started sobbing. Yoga was my one place to center myself, but I let it be a place to perform and prove to myself that I'm somehow ""good enough"". My back's been sore (building that strength back up!), and I was feeling disappointed in myself. I've had some help picking myself up out of my rut, and I finally did my daily yoga... at 10pm. This was a much needed session after yesterday.  I remember struggling to do a side plank in one of these earlier videos, but I managed to keep my posture today. It felt good to just relax and enjoy yoga again.

304.0,"Day 16 ✔️ I read a piece of wisdom today that many of us have probably heard before in different versions: ""Only that which dies can renew itself."" - J. Krishnamurti. As the days go by, I notice small sacrifices that I'm willing to make in order to improve myself. I'm able to say no (politely yes assertively) to people who don't contribute to others or commit to themselves. I guess it's a lot easier to be with people who are similar to us rather than otherwise. Sometimes, I'm really proud of the people and teachers around me, and sometimes not so much--and this is usually a direct reflection of how I feel on the inside! The gradual changes I'm making each day feels like parts of ""old me dying"" as I'm trying to renew myself. And with this community I feel like I'm on the right path. Namaste  🙏

439.0,"2 days ago I got very excited when I realised both heels were on the floor during downward dog. So imagine my happiness when I'm concentrating on my breathing (as I have a cold) and suddenly realise that I'm in the side twisty thing with my knee off the floor for the first time! Adding to that excitement I did my side plank with both of my feet stacked rather than both feet touching the floor. I'm feeling unstoppable today

447.0,"So I gotta say...  At this point on my day 16.  I really like you and your workout!  I've promoted you to my sister and friends. And what I like about your style is: you give options in your poses concerning difficulty levels.  I have so far been able to hold each pose and do the extra difficult positions. But I feel each day is moving  right along with my body capabilities.  There is nothing worse than starting a new workout and getting discouraged because you can't do half of the workout..  Also I notice  that you have a well rounded work out and if we worked our arms hard on day 15... Then on day 16  you mention that our arms might be sore and  you focus on a  different area. Which makes me feel like I've got a personal yoga train in my home working out just with me!    so thankyou thus far for helping me achieve flexibility, strength, and relaxation all at the same time :)",UgyWuRTIWkxH5JbYj7N4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-04-13T23:09:46Z,0.999135434627533

534.0,"I should preface this by saying that I adore Adriene and her videos - she has gotten me back into yoga and I love seeing people's stories on here.  :)
However, her series is very different from other beginner yoga series I have done.  I wish that she would focus more on breathing, meditating, and slowly stretching into new poses rather than more of a fast-paced exercise yoga that this turns into sometimes.  Some of her videos are perfect and I don't mind getting a workout occasionally, but sometimes I come away feeling exhausted rather than energized.  I also find some things difficult for beginners.  For example I can't even touch my toes so the two moves she did with touching toes and putting hands under feet I couldn't do at all.  Also, at the end of her videos I would love for her to let some soft music play or lead her viewers into a meditation rather than ending it abruptly.",UghmMsdejTtMu3gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-02-22T00:17:39Z,0.8265769481658936

Don't let that bottom shoulder fall into itself or it will really pull on your ligaments and soft tissue. If the side planks or planks in general are giving you trouble, check out an exercise called Turkish Get Up (TGU), it's fantastic for building the core strength that will make flowing through routines like this much more enjoyable.

716.0,"In some of your videos you mention the healing power of yoga and today I really felt it. I was having one of those days, which almost made me skip today's practice. I'm glad I didn't. The time on the mat was soothing and exactly what I needed after a hard day! So thanks for the video and the challenge. I'm loving it! PS: for the first time since I subscribed to your channel (around 3 months ago) I was able to hold the side plank without shaking like a leaf.

I go into each practice with the mindset of just show up and be present and I do the best I can. I'm seeing a lot of people are progressing from wherever they started and it is such a great thing to see.

722.0,"Interesting practice--I found the name of the practice misleading today--nothing easy about those moves for me. I was especially frustrated when the posture was to put my hands under my feet without any suggestion of modifications for those who just aren't there yet. But then Adriene said to let go of frustrations, so I did (or tried). Then to may amazement, I was able to do side plank--earlier in the series, I was not even able to approach those. So, as always, the yoga is surprising. ",Ugid5C-gQK0ywHgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-01-17T22:33:53Z,0.9599170088768005
