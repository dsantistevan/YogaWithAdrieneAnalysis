56.0,"A couple months ago, a guy took advantage of me, and I let him do with barely any fight. It was a long, complicated night, following weeks of manipulations that I only realised much later. Only now am I dealing with the aftermath, after it cost me what I thought was a close and strong friendship. I am constantly so overwhelmed by what happened that I can barely move, walk, or do the most simple tasks. I spend most of my days sitting down, crying, and contemplating what happened and why instead of doing the million things I should do. And the only thing that helps me through it at the moment is my boyfriend.
However, as I've done almost every day for the past 19 days, I spread my yoga mat on the floor in the morning after having had breakfast and for however long the practise lasts, I give so much needed love to my body. And it helps, so, so much. 
Thank you for those videos, Adriene. Thank you for your positive energy. Thank you for catching us when we fall.

So thanks also...it was not cold here in Maryland.
It was awful humid n hot n sticky all day but it finally broke into a beautifully refreshing heavy rain storm,which I enjoyed by pairing with doing my yoga on the porch outside with headphones and adding a nice pairing of a few Tool songs as well during my own extended yoga portions in between n after. 
Tool‚Äôs songs (Fear Innoculum, Vicarious, Jambi, Parabol/&Parabola, n finally Lateralus), Rain storm, & Yoga go sooooo perfect together, I feel great now! Anyone else out there enjoy this combo?

I feel good, I feel more confident overall, and my anxiety has been at an all time low lately. I noticed I am also better at not ""obsessing"" over the number on the scale.

I've decided to take the afternoon to reflect on what I need in my life right now and on my way home, all I could think about was how I wanted to get on the mat and connect to my body. Today was the first day that I really felt my soul crave this time that I take out just for me. I am so grateful that I found yoga and to Adriene and the YWA community for becoming such a light in my life. Namaste",UgydG_SAYfayIohCGP94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-01-15T11:36:41Z,0.9965271353721619

 I am doing yoga with you (20th day and so far so good). I try to really do everything safely and find places needing more space.
 I do have one worry and need a help to understand problem. So I have recently found one article warning that stretching a hamstrings is bad for you and keeping them tight as they are is naturally supporting your back and  position while standing. 

''people with strong functional back and gluteal muscles may have trouble bending over with straight knees because their extensor chain works efficiently''. 

 I'm sending you link to this information so you can help me understand, what do you think about it?

498.0,"Day 19. Thought I would share this.¬†Half way through my morning yoga practice, my youngest can be heard¬†banging and crashing around the house,¬†then bursts in..'I lost my headhones!!' (only gave them to him last night and he has yet to leave the house), I ignore him, he says it louder, my response from my breathing exercise..'Oh for christs sake!!! I am in the middle of my yoga practice and meant to have calm!!!'. Pause the video, quick look in his room, not there, so say, 'oh just have mine, look when you get home!' Back to the mat, restart video and Adriane says 'namaste', I breath deep and say 'namaste'. Burst our laughing as the irony of the situation is not lost on me. A pal at work told me that she had done this and was¬† now on the revolution. 

I needed something new to kick start my well being and whilst I still have to sort my diet out at least everyday I am back to working on my health.

I just wanted to say thank you, because your lovely presence, balance, energy and smile are really inspiring and ever since I started following your yoga video's I felt really good about my body and about what I can do.

728.0,"I like that this was day 19. I like how your mix of the videos doesn't make it a mountain we're climbing, with each new video necessarily being a more intense challenge than the last. That's not how it needs to be, or should be. We do face harder and harder challenges in life sometimes, but we also have periods of ease and times when we must remember to breathe and care for ourselves. Thank you.
