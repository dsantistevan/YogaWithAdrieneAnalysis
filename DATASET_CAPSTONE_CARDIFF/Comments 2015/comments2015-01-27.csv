0.0,"I just got off a 10-hour shift (that included shaking 15kg bags of dog food, dog pee, and screaming children) and the last thing I wanted to do was get on the mat, but I'm so glad I did, I feel so stretched out and relaxed, my mind has finally stopped buzzing, and i'm full of a gentle euphoria. Part of my contentedness comes from reading the comments section.

4.0,"skipped 3 days of doing yoga to return back to where I was at day 27. I feel like the more I talk about yoga and its benefits with my friends, the less inclined I feel to do it. 🤔

 felt some frustration in myself as I was trying to follow Adriene to a T (when do I need to fold my hands at my heart? is it now? what are her thumbs doing??). Tree pose was difficult for me to stay balanced on my left foot (with my right foot propped up), but for my right foot, I was gloriously still for several seconds! The first time in the entire program. I'm doing this practice after dinner and am grateful it's not too intense lol. I also feel energized to finish the day strong.

181.0,"Day 27 ✔️ I'm becoming less of a negligent and negative friend, and more of a caring counselor and positive friend towards my body. What I mean is that throughout my practice today, a lot of my body wasn't doing what I was telling it to do--my wrist would hurt, shoulder pain would flare up, etc--but instead of talking down and critizing them for not cooperating, I started to modify the practice and continue the flow--I didn't shame them for feeling how they did. I would counsel my wrist and ask ""okay, we'll have you tried this?"" And then I would go on my fist from open palm and it worked. When shoulder pain would collapse my downward dog, I changed my perspective: that my body was asking for healing because it wanted to go to the floor because it was so tired. I found what felt good and made the practice as much as I could my own while following along. And towards the end, I could feel my body thank me in shavashna; it just needed some support.I was relaxed and yawning so much. This caused me to tear up (not sure if this is due to emotional blockages clearing up or just my tear ducts opening up from all the yawning or both lol), but time slowed down so much, that I could feel the warmth of my tears as they floated out of my eyes and then became cold as they dove down the sides of my face.

246.0,"This WAS fun! My balance has gotten so much better. Interestingly enough, when I fell out of tree 🌲 pose, if I did forget to pull up, and dumped all my weight on one side, I fell right over again. Pulling up and focusing on the midline helped a lot. I’m getting used to the inversion styled poses as well. A month has carried me so far you guys! Less anxiety, finding time for me and for my family. It helps with setting intentions so you’re not always in a negative state of mind. Handling stress with a MUCH calmer demeanor. My 4 year old is also excited to hit the mat with me each afternoon after school. I can’t recommend this practice enough.

Adriene mentions going to look at the foundations of yoga for the tree 🌲 pose. I watched two of the videos already (In preparation for the 31 days next) to feel a bit more confident to focus and look away from the video. I’m getting used to many of the names of the poses, so when she says to go into a specific pose I don’t have to look up and can focus on myself and my breath. Foundations also helps with self-correction. Since yoga is about energy, I don’t was to block any flow and not reap the full benefit.

247.0,"i was a total newbie before starting this 30 days of yoga practice. for me, the practice has been a lot of:
 1) self acceptance. accepting my abilities today for what they are, and not feeling bad if it doesnt match up with where i want to be. 
2) trust. trust and belief in myself that i CAN do it, i am strong enough. and trust in you, adriene, that you will help me find self love and not put me up to do anything that isn't possible. 
3) challenge and endurance. challenging myself to get on the mat when i dont feel good about myself, or dont feel like it, or feel guilty for having skipped a few days. sticking to the pose, even when i desperately fail at it (lots of balance positions).

The instructor wanted me to do chataranga her way, didn't offer me a modification and suggested that I do some push ups (""I don't know, maybe you should do some push ups or something..."").

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I have practiced yoga for the past two years about 2-3 times a week.  I found your 30 Days of yoga early this summer.  As a teacher, I thought this would be a great, relaxing challenge for me for this summer.  Around day 10, I noticed what an amazing, positive difference it made for me to practice daily.  I wasn't able to be totally consistent, but I know the mindfulness it helped me develop and the stress releasing benefits it brought helped me through the sudden death of my father.  I believe this was a gift to me from my heavenly father, knowing the summer I faced.  Thank you again,

385.0,"27 days ago, I had never done yoga. I over ate, drank a little too much vino and hadn't done exercise for about 9 years. My 19 year old daughter introduced me to adriene and I have followed every day since. To begin with, I had zero balance. Tree pose wS impossible for more than 1/2 a second on each side. I couldn't touch the floor in forward fold and even cat and dog poses killed my palms and knees. I had to force myself to commit to the program. Today, I managed tree pose, without holding on to the work top, for a whole minute on my right side and a little less on my left. My palms and knees are no longer a problem and I can rest my palms on the floor in forward fold. I don't WANT to eat or drink anything that isn't beneficial to my health and well being and I'm finding myself wanting to get up 1/2 hour earlier to be able to start my day with yoga, every morning. I feel emotionally and physically completely different...in a great way! Xx",UggE2dH2WKNeZHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-09-19T07:51:33Z,0.5941566824913025

I am so used to always having to find my center of gravity even with two feet on the ground, but today I slide into tree pose with very little effort. I can't touch my toes yet, nor do my feet reach the floor in downward dog, but I am getting there and that is all that counts.

Anyway, today I finally stood in tree pose without falling. What an accomplishment! A little shaky still but I'm okay with that. It'll get better in time. Doing yoga with you has taught me so much about myself and about the practice of yoga. I have learned to love and accept where I am at.

Is there anything that can help me from holding the pose better so I don't keep sliding forward with my hands?
