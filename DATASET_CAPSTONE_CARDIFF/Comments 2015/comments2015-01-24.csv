I’m not flexible or in shape/ fit in any way, but these videos never make me feel unwelcome or unable to participate. I had to comment today just to say this was one of the most amazing yoga sessions so far. Not because it was easy, I’ve enjoyed challenging myself, but because I felt so relaxed. I loved the music, it was raining whilst I did it and I loved the extended shavasana too. I’ve been pushing myself to continue this as I want yoga to be a daily practice for me and something I make time for, and you make it soo easy every day because each session it is like somehow you know exactly what I need. Whether it’s a longer steady practice, a faster paced challenge or a short chill low energy relaxing stretch. Whether I’m feeling floor poses, seated, standing etc. Every day I find it all lining up to my ideal length and exactly what I need. I am so glad I found this!!!

I felt relaxed and in fact the stretches helped ease some of the pain and release some tension.

My daughter had an online AP exam today, so I took my son for a walk in a local nature area to give her peace and quiet ( 13 year old ""little"" brothers are loud....). We were almost finished with our walk, and I didn't notice the tree root on which I tripped.  Total face plant, hit my mouth and nose.   Darn, do mouths bleed a lot.  Teeth are fine and the nose is a bit tender but not broken.  Inside of upper lip is torn up and swollen.  Started feeling sorry for myself and tried to talk myself out of doing day 24.  I knew that down dogs and inversions would NOT feel good with the nose.  :-)  So happy that today was all about being chill.   It was just what my heart, mind and body needed.

249.0,"Day 24  ✔️ Good morning friends! I hope everyone is taking the time they need to take a break from things. I often get so caught up with doing so many things at once that, until my body is physically telling me to stop by excessive sleepiness, fatigue, etc., I tend to keep going. Yesterday was one of those days. I wanted to take a quick nap before yoga, and I ended up waking up in the morning today. But I avoided beating myself up about it, and just moved on to today and did this yoga practice after my morning walk. And it was so amazing! A restorative practice after a nice long walk (the latter which I normally don't do at night) turned out to be a blessing in disguise. My muscles were more warm and accommodating in the stretches and my hips and shoulders opened up SO MUCH with pleasant snap-crackle-pops in the forward folds and windshield wipers. I think that is where we tend to keep our stress, so today my body was just like ""damn dawg, you need to take some chill time."" I realize no mount of Kale or Probiotics can fix a mentally fixed mindset. Lol.

I also tried to view the difficult yesterday as a coming of big change; often its said that things become really difficult right before a massive change happens--I remember the analogy of a pin on a balloon: the surface where the pin punctures the balloon becomes the most tense right before it explodes! 

I've been saying ""no"" to a lot of things since I started this practice, and sometimes it feels like a sacrifice to say no so much to things I enjoyed. But some reflections helps me realize that it's not really a sacrifice if I'm giving up things that didn't help me grow in the first place. Sure my weekends are a lot more boring, I go out a lot less frequently, and spend that time cooking or in front of a YouTube video, but oddly enough life is already much better. Namaste friends, and thank you again teacher 🙏",UgwnAHr6899rwHCEI8V4AaABAg,0.0,2.0,2019-11-22T16:54:08Z,-0.5952345132827759

443.0,"Hi Adriene - I rarely comment but feel like it's important for me to do so today. Background:  I'm a 65yo woman who's had MS for more than 40 yrs. Weakening my legs & disrupting my sense of balance. I've been doing yoga with you for about 3 yrs & it's made a (wonderful) world of difference for me. I have come to love my daily home yoga practice with Adriene! And I was absolutely loving TRUE until about 10 days ago - when all the high lunges, standing work & balance exercises began to really overwhelm me. But I carried on. The last 3 days, however, I've noticed my legs and feet hurting more & more off the mat while I was also feeling more unstable than usual. So today (day 28 for me), I was gonna just skip. But then I felt guilty & you were sitting so maybe it wouldn't be all legs again.... So I started it - oh no, “let's start at the top of our mat” - and I went along, dreading the moment you'd say “slide your right leg back” & then it happened. I did. Then the high lunge. And I said NO, NO, NO. NO!!!! And I quit, choosing instead to do one of fave YWA videos (Gentle Yummy Yoga, Day 24, 30 Days of Yoga). As always, that was delicious - and gave me renewed conviction to return to Day 28 of TRUE. So I did. But I kept my leg on the ground when you got to high lunges & then, after the twist, when you wanted to go further, I went my own way, returning to YWA stretches & twists that open & comfort my hips, rather than putting more strain on them. I did it with grace & intention, moving from the center, and refused to let my brain tell me I was “cheating.” I met up with for the deep squat & followed you thru the rest of the exercise - and am now so glad I didn't walk away when I got frustrated and mad, or even after Gentle Yummy Yoga because this taught me that it's my body and you can't possibly know what is best for me. That's my responsibility. You can only give me tools - and you,ve given me so, so many. It was lovely to find that I knew exactly hiw I could put some of them together today to bring me through & past my anger and annoyance to the place I always hope to be after my YWA. Long story, I know, but I needed to tell it to myself and to you. Thank you! Lesley",UgzH3JqrhOY_pNuwz1x4AaABAg,2.0,1.0,2018-01-31T19:31:12Z,0.3071903748347841
444.0,Adriene.. the first time I did yoga at home was with your hip opener video and a youth I was helping to take care of. We both loved your sense of humour instantly. I am so glad I finally did this 30 days and cannot believe I only have 6 days to go! It has changed my life. Practising yoga has given me back so much of what I lost after 2 bad car crashes. You are so good at instruction that I rarely look at the screen.

I do have one question if you have a minute (or anyone else is super welcome to help!).  I'm having trouble any time we windshield wiper the legs or when we're on our back and side twist one knee to the opposite side.  I know it might be normal for a beginner's knees to be absolutely nowhere near the ground, but I was wondering what kind of stretches I could do to increase flexibility.  I didn't know if it was more of a hip, knee, or back problem.

747.0,"Hi Adriene! I did your sun salutation first, then into this yummy practice! I have a question for you... I find flat back lying poses very uncomfortable for my back. I have a lot of lower back pain. What do you suggest I do to help my back? 

Knees to chest and any forward bends are ok but anything including a very straight or flat back hurts! 

That said I am much more flexible and calm. I love your practice. Thank you so much xxx",UgjBudULf1QBdXgCoAEC,0.0,3.0,2015-01-25T11:55:55Z,0.9520698189735413
