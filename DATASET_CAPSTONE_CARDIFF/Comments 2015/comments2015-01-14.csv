39.0,"Day 14. Yoga with Adriene - Mindful Hatha Yoga Workout. Practice today was an interesting one. I learned a lot about my lunges, my hips, and my general flexibility. First we come to the hovering cat poses and I took the first two on like it was one of the easiest things in the world. The third one hit me rather much harder and I enjoyed it all the more so. Then we move onto our lunges and transition from them into half splits. The first thing I learned is that my mat is rather thin, and upon reviewing the video, I notice that Adriene has doubled up on hers. These lunges/half splits wound up bothering my knees a lot. However, I grit my teeth and worked through them. The second thing that I noticed is that in her lunges when her knee is on the ground, her hips are rather far forward of her knee. Mine were almost directly above my knees. I feel as if its a combination of several factors that contribute to this, mainly being a lack of flexibility in the hips/thighs and a bit of extra weight I may be carrying around. So more things to work on as I continue my practice. I'm ashamed to admit, I didnt even try to bring my foot up and grab it like she is doing in the thumbnail. I feel as if its because my hips were over my knees instead of in front of them. I'll have to go back and revisit those poses. Overall it was good to be on the mat and moving once more. Thank you for yet another wonderful session Adriene! Namaste.",UgzkvHGwjFIIOY0S9oR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-04-21T02:57:26Z,-0.8420842885971069

70.0,"I've been enjoying your videos.. sometimes i get very frustrated as an obese person where my feet can't handle certain positions and they cramp up. That's a challenge in general with yoga being a bit ""size-ist"" if you will. I definitely feel that way in classes which is why I appreciate this program. Still, nothing is perfect and I'm sharing here in hopes to bring light to certain challenges you may not be aware of. Balancing my weight on my feet in that altered cat position almost always makes them cramp up. You are usually very gentle and accommodating with challenging positions, perhaps you're not aware of that struggle for the bigger folks.

304.0,"Thank you, Adriene.
I have always been the start-don't-finish type of person, with everything. I also didn't pay much attention to yoga, it seemed silly to me. I dance ballet and I've gone to the gym very often (not now).
Lately I started to make some changes in my life, like better diet, more exercise, a structured routine... and I gave up shortly after, as always. Then one day I found your videos on YouTube, I don't really know how because I wasn't looking for yoga practices.
I decided to give it a try right away to this 30 day yoga challenge, hoping that I would finish something for once in my life. I would pick one of those mats that go under the sleeping bag when you camp, and I would go to my garden. I ended up full of dirt and my pets were messing around, but I felt GOOD. Indescribably good. I've always loved stretching more than cardio, and this seemed exactly like my cup of tea.
I've always kind of hated being outside and getting dirty.  But it was the only place I could do yoga in the afternoon and I went every single time without missing a day (well, I missed one because it was my sister's birthday party and the house was full of kids). I did the practice outside until day 10 or so.
Along the way, my mind had automatically ""fixed"" itself. I found it easy to maintain a healthy diet and leave bread aside as much as possible (I could NEVER do that before!). You could see me eating apples and drinking natural orange juice, and drinking milk without any chocolate. Even saying ""no"" when someone offered me something sweet as dessert! That is totally not me. And I find it easy to do! Like something changed inside.
I also found a video of a boy talking about how much time he spent on the cellphone without noticing, and that pushed me to try to stick to a routine. Something I could never do before, now seems relatively easy. I wake up at 6:30 AM (me, who always slept until 10 AM), do yoga (I'm on day 14 currently) on my living room (everyone is sleeping, and I find it really peaceful... and clean), then have a shower and I start my day by 7:00 AM. I also keep track of what I do during the day, to know how much time I spent doing every thing. I'm using the phone a lot less!
Thank you, Adriene, for doing such awesome videos and helping me see life another way. Yoga has become part pf my day, the part I look forward to with joy and excitement, and fondness as well. Thank you for doing this for us. You are great.
Best regards from Argentina,

309.0,"Doing today's practice made me realize how much I've improved. I find the downward dog a lot easier. Before my wrists hurt and so did the muscles in the back of my leg. Now I don't feel any pain stretching in downward dog and I'm closer to the mat. My wrists feel stronger as well. I shake less as well with the plank, and can almost touch my toes.

I used to do 3 years of dance once a week for an hour and my aim was to be able to do the splits at least. It was very difficult and I felt like my body wasn't stretching at or nor strong. We would just warm up and do the same stretches each week. Which was pointless because I felt not as flexible as the other dancers. Doing yoga everyday so far with you has made me realize how important stretching everyday is as I feel more flexible than an hour a week has ever done. I feel a lot stronger to. I also have noticed it's getting easier just hearing what to do and not keeping my neck aching up at the tv.! Thanks! 09/03/2019. I will keep a updating in the comments.

I didn't think I would be able to hold my knees off the ground just lifting by me toes but I did it!   I was shaky as all get out but I did it!  I don't think I'll ever get onto my heels in downward dog but as someone else pointed out it did feel more like a restorative pose today.  And my transitions are getting slightly better.   I'm also beginning to self correct my shoulders before you tell us to relax them :)  I even did a little self meditation after the practice was over (and you know I don't like meditating!)  But I burned myself yesterday on my stomach and sat cross-legged, concentrating on my breath and imagined the healing breath entering and leaving through that wound.

369.0,"Couldn't grab the toe but hey! loved every moment of it. 

On an unrelated note, its taken me almost a month to get to day 14. I keep starting things and leaving them half way; that's just how I am as a person and of course I don't approve of it. So I started the 30 day challenge on June 20. practiced the next day (day 2) and then day 3 was 4th of July. I know :( then again the next practice was July 10. But since July 14 I have been more and more regular, as I think I can 'feel' the results. Anyway, I've been practicing daily for the last 7 days and I feel I finally might be able to break away from my start-don't-finish way of life! 

Now the results I was talking about - for years, I couldn't sit down on the floor without falling 'thud' like a sack of potatoes, forget getting up gracefully :P so just out of curiosity I tried it Today. And guess what, I can now sit on the ground without touching my hands on the floor AND stand up from a seated position without touching my hands on the floor! It's a big deal for me! yay!

It is amazing how having things on your mind or other distractions can affect your breathing and energy.  I plan on getting to bed sooner so that I can wake up before, in particular, my 3-year-old granddaughter, I just couldn't hack it today with her awake.  I may be sharing too much but I just need a breather to think.  Overall I am most appreciative of everything in my life and for you for offering this practice.
