0.0,"This has been such a great series - feel so lucky to have stumbled upon these videos and Adriene's channel. I've dabbled in yoga before but this is the first time I've truly felt the benefits and it's all thanks to Adriene's encouragement and positive attitude on the mat. Before day 1 I was suffering from back pain which I've had for almost a year, day 25 I feel so much looser and more flexible and no longer in pain. I can't stop doing forward folds and downward dogs wherever I am! Big love.",Ughn4BiQDENDCngCoAEC,0.0,230.0,2015-09-25T10:52:00Z,0.9995648264884949

105.0,"Too true Adriene.... the hardest part we've already done and that's starting. Even though I like yoga, it doesn't give me that big dopamine rush that i jump up and wanna do it. I've found very little of what's good for me, gives me those dopamine spikes so then I think, yoga today, or home work out today or I have to catch up on the project today or I have to do maths... and really I often procrastinate pretty bad and will instead waste a lot of my time on social media as my mind believes the dopamine is there through the hope of messages to me or something lol. But really the good stuff for us is often the stuff we don't want to do and we need that will power to lead to consistency which then over time turns into an habit. My mind is still like...why should i do x y z when i don't get excited to do it? But you find when you push through and get on the other side, you are glad you did it and know it's better than just sitting on social media but the same thing plays out again and again.... so keep going guys, keep pushing!

Today I'm feeling a lot better so it's time for me to start with day 18. I'm going to do this next month as well so I guess it's okay even though I'm feeling a bit bummed out for missing so many days xx,UgjlHFsgpuQ2QngCoAEC,2.0,0.0,2015-01-26T10:06:00Z,0.9867684245109558

348.0,I loved the dancing warrior - it was well worth repeating free style-ee. Day 25 is time to practise the wobbly tree - back to foundation for me. That 12 minute tree tutorial was brilliant. It's ironed out the kinks a bit and improved the balance. Foot to shin and standing still today ¬†instead of blowin' in the breeze! Yey \0/. What a lovely way to start a Wintry Monday morning.
