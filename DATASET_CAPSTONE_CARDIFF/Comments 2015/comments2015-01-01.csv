7558.0,"I just completed Day 30, but I wanted to circle back around the Day 1 to offer a testimonial to those of you who are just starting out. I'm the last guy to the toga party-- I mean yoga party. I'm thoroughly middle-aged and congenitally stiff as a dry twig. Thirty days ago, I was nursing a chronic back injury and experiencing a lot of pain from what appeared to be a pinched nerve. Today, not only am I stronger and more flexible, but my back and nerve problems are totally under control. The 30 Day Challenge is a bit like an epic poem. Following its long arc has been a beautiful and moving experience. Thank you.",Ugh5lAeDy90Th3gCoAEC,85.0,7234.0,2015-06-15T22:35:35Z,0.9920870661735535

1227.0,"If you’re just starting out, I hope this helps. Three years ago, I started the 30 Days...and quit after 8 days. During Covid, I decided to try again and it was just what the doctor ordered. I felt improvements by day 5 and soon found myself in life-giving rhythm. This has been a God-send. I’m in a time of big transition (resigned as pastor, my mom died, launching a coaching business, America in turmoil, etc) but starting each day with Adriene has brought renewal. I feel replenished. I finished the 30 days yesterday and I’m back to start again today. So...take it easy. Don’t worry about perfection. Just prioritize the time, show up, and be present. You’ll get results in body and soul. Peace! :D",UgxONeU-pOlZEY2X6YJ4AaABAg,42.0,2555.0,2020-06-13T17:14:22Z,0.9979379773139954

1314.0,"I'm like the last person to even think about doing Yoga, but after months of University work at my desk being hunched over, mixed with quarantine rendering me stiff and inactive, I thought I should treat my body with this.  Hopefully throughout this journey some passersby will come across this comment as I intend to edit this comment daily for the 30 days to share my journey! [Day 30/30]
-
Day 1 - Although light and mellow, there were some poses that were tough for me to do, but I still did them!  This is not in any way a fault of Adriene's for making it 'difficult,' it's just cos I've been so inactive for so long lol.  But after the video ended my body felt warm and my back feels looser!  Already noticing I'm not clicking or creaking as much.
-
Day 2 - Wow I started this with very tight/obstructed hip flexors in the Child's Pose and ended with a completely new flexibility, mobility and 'looseness.'  Also began to sweat which was a surprise for a complete Yoga newbie.  This was significantly tougher than yesterday for me, but in the end felt so good.  Back and hip flexors feel most changed today. 
-
Day 3 - Felt much more different to what I had already done from the past 2 days and it also felt really fast.  Still nice and calming, but personally I hope tomorrow is more like what days 1 and 2 were like!  Feel good overall in terms of agility and flexibility.
-
Day 4 - Now THIS is what I needed, a full on focus for my back.  My biggest reason to even start this challenge was to help loosen my back up and 4 days in, it's done just that.  Felt so good and also (I think I've done it wrong lol but) my heels touched the mat in Downward Dog!  Hope that's a sign of actual progress and not because I've done it wrong lol.  Another great video and personally felt much better than yesterday's.
-
Day 5 - This was 16 minutes?? I swear it only felt like 5 wow this went by so quick.  I felt this was very calming for me, however I was in a happier mood than usual today so that could have influenced my feelings.  Some of the positions were difficult to do, but that's no fault of Adriene's.  It's mine for not getting flexible earlier!  But we're learning I guess lol:)
-
Day 6 - Oh good GOD this one killed me lmao.  Yeah my core strength is effectively zero so this is most definitely the hardest video of the series yet (feel like I'm speaking too soon, but I'm tryna be as transparent as possible).  Really felt engagment in my core and this Yoga session felt much longer to me than yesterday despite them being 16 mins each.
-
Day 7 - Oof man this was tough, but I'm gonna blame my over-indulgence (it was Eid today!).  Probs the sweatiest I've gotten cos of Yoga so far, but it was pretty good.  I feel I would have done better had I not ate so much today lol, but it's all good! Hopefully tomorrow will be better for me personally.
-
Day 8 - This session has really killed my motivation:( it exposed how inflexible I am and I'm metally back to square one with the mindset of 'Yoga isn't for me.'  My hip flexors are still so tight which has demotivated me further because I really thought I was making progress:( I could barely do most of the moves because of how tight my hip flexors are and the cramp I was getting.  Want to give up, but I won't.
-
Day 9 - I think yesterday was an odd blip for me because WOW this felt amazing today! Everything felt so strong, sure they were difficult, but I managed to do nearly everything with good/great form.  There were some minor adjustments to the moves I had to make because of my inflexibility, but I am definitely getting better.  I can also time my breathing better.
-
Day 10 - We're a third of the way through!  I'm so glad I'm starting to do Yoga in the late morning/early afternoon because it nicely sets the tone of my mood and my day.  This was a nice and slow session, felt nice and centred afterwards.  Went by very fast.
-
Day 11 - This felt so incredible for me today wow, I was really focused on all the moves and positions and just feeling every part of my body being really engaged.  I think once this 30 Day challenge is done, I will be coming back to this video daily forever because it targeted where the main site of issue is; my hip flexors.  I felt so much warmer and looser after this, can't wait for tomorrow!
-
Day 12 - This was a nice, slow and soothing session for me.  Very peaceful flow of movements, despite some poses being a little difficult to do!  Managed to keep up with the pace nicely and modified poses for my ability level.
-
Day 13 - The hardest part of this entire session was tryna get your palms to meet in Eagle Pose cos how on earth can you pretzel your arms like that??  Really good session overall though, feeling more and more connected per day and I can't believe it's been nearly 2 weeks of this!  Flown by:)
-
Day 14 - 2 weeks done!  Been a great journey, loved it so far.  This was a nice short session, but man my hamstrings cramped in that new pose:(  Hurt pretty bad, but on the whole this was really nice.  Can't believe we're nearly halfway done.
-
Day 15 - We're halfway through!  So crazy, also sorry for not updating this when I did it yesterday, it was my dad's bday:) but this was definitely the most challenging one so far.  A lot of balance required and I'm not afraid to say I literally toppled over in a few poses hehe.  But it felt really good.  Can't believe we've made it this far!
-
Day 16 - As good as this felt, this was NOT easy OR breezy lol.  It was fast, fluid, intense and sweaty.  But it felt really great.  I'm over halfway into this journey and I'm STILL surprised how sweaty I can get just from yoga!  Really good session today, shower is very much needed hehe.
-
Day 17 - My heels can touch the mat in Downward Dog!  This time with proper form, that is massive progress for me personally and also I was surprised I was able to reach back and grab my arch in that new pose.  Loving how much progress I have made and how agile and flexible I am feeling compared to Day 1:)
-
Day 18 - This felt reaaally good for my hip flexors, which have been thecommon theme of my daily Yoga updates doing this challenge.  I also surprised myself that I actually managed to keep my balance AND bend over in that single-legged forward fold! The stretch that I felt was amazing and literally 2 minutes after it, my hips flexors had never felt so loose!  Amazing session today.
-
Day 19 - This was a very soothing and calming session.  Probably the most connected I've ever felt to my breathing and energy, in my entire life.  Much needed wind-down and relaxation, can't believe we'll be going into the final 10 days from tomorrow!
-
Day 20 - We're in the final 10 days I can't believe it!  Was in a rush today as I was attending a peaceful protest for BLM here today, but this managed to soothe and calm my mind very well.  I even made further progress in my flexibility!  So great to see the progress in myself.
-
Day 21 - 3 weeks officially complete!  I made even more progress here I'm v proud.  Managed to place my palms onto the mat in forward fold with straight legs, I also managed to hold Warrior Pose in near perfect form and I even did the Frog Squat for the first time ever!  And we still have 9 days left to go to make more progress:)
-
Day 22 - Another one that did my hip flexors really well, loved how deep the moves and stretches felt.  Also loved the focus on Warrior Pose movements, they further helped my hips to open.
-
Day 23 - Just one week remaining:( kinda sad it's ending soon.  Anyways,the side plank was quite difficult but I weirdly noticed my balance and strength is greater on my left side than my right.  Strange thing to occur, but just a thing for me to improve on I guess!
-
Day 24 - Wow how strange is it that the first video where Savasana lasted for a few minutes, I didn't even notice.  I was in pure relaxation and stillness until I noticed the gentle music had stopped.  Anyway, this is another video I think I'll be returning to after his challenge is done as it really attacked my hip flexors well!  Another great session, just 6 days remain:(
-
Day 25 - Went by very quick so I decided to take up Adriene's advice of doing one of the options she gave at the end.  I did the hip openers since that's been my main focus and weakness, but other than that it was a nice and easy and mellow session today.  Getting closer to the end now:(
-
Day 26 - This was a nice and calming session and honestly didn't feel that long to me!  Very soothing stretches into different parts of my body that somehow needed to be stretched today, coincidentally, more than ever.
-
Day 27 - This was like a really good test for myself to see how much progress I've made with my flexibility.  And I'm happy to say and see so much progress!  Flat feet in Downward Dog, improved hip motility, deeper Cat-Cow and a lot less stffiness and pain.  This video for me was an amazing progress checkpoint!
-
Day 28 - Wow that flipped Downward Dog was insane, but what's crazier is the fact that I even managed to pull it off!  Felt so good to do a difficult move.  Overall great video again, was great for my entire body and I loved how Adriene gave us a bit more freedom on how to transition into different positions.  It's a nice subtle way to show her build in trust in us over this 30 day journey and to remind us that it's always been us in control, not Adriene:)
-
Day 29 - The penultimate session:( it was another nice video, nothing too challenging or difficult.  Can't believe tomorrow is the last one!
-
Day 30 - Journey complete.  Thank you Adriene for making an average person like me find a new appreciation for Yoga, for guiding a complete newbie and nurturing me the past 30 days and for helping me fix my back and hip flexors.

I just kept at it; and I increased my time with you just a little every day. Now, here at the end of March 2018, I practice yoga daily.  In fact I'm doing three engagements (day one, two and three) with you a day. So has ""Yoga with Adrienne"" helped me?  Well I've lost 27 pounds and I look a decade younger.  I've also gotten about 6 other men in their 50's to try doing ""Yoga with Adrienne"".  Happy to send you a before and after pic (just tell me where to send it).  

Oh one more thing - I'm not done losing weight or feeling good!  I'm actually hooked now because you are such a great instructor.

I'm now finishing my fourth round of 30 days and I'm so happy. It's just how I start every day now -- part of my ""morning rituals.""  It's one of the ""pandemic positives"" that are mine to keep.
As Adriene suggests, we're supposed to become our own guide in time so I don't always follow step for step. Sometimes I turn the audio down and freestyle with the video running for inspiration and to help me when I get stuck.
Also, I went to her website and bought the course. She has a ""name your own price"" thing, so it supports the cause, is not cost prohibitive and you don't have to watch YouTube commercials. Pretty cool.

4454.0,"I'm on day 29 and wanted to circle back to describe how powerful, but gentle, this series is. I'm a 65-year-old man with a bit of a belly and I sit at a computer all day long. The first few days had me breathing hard and sweating and I had to take a lot of breaks, huffing, and puffing. 

I told myself, if I make it to Day 5 I'll reward myself with a yoga matt and blocks. No sweat ;-)

As each day passed  I noticed how my body re-adjusted. My movements during the day became smoother, my digestion completely changed (for the better), and my appetite really shifted. I now eat less at each meal which is really cool.

I'm amazed at how this 30-40 minutes each day of being focused and stretching has transformed me.

Adriene is encouraging, gentle, and graceful and is a wonderful guide to the experience of doing yoga for yourself. Her continual reminders of deep breathing with the movement and the suggestions of being playful and smiling really help your mind get in synch. She shows many alternative poses and after every challenging pose, she offers one allowing you to catch your breath and rest.

All of a sudden I felt so much energy inside me that I began to uncontrollably SHAKE and believe God had taken over me momentarily. I soon discovered that what I experienced was a ‘Spiritual Awakening’.

We're on day 12 and we are ADDICTED! We don't know how life was before starting the challenge, but we know we won't stop after the 30 days are over. We feel the change in our bodies and mood already.

As well as being more flexible it has definitely made me fitter and stronger than I expected - I even managed a 10k run without any training (not something I’d recommend of course...).

754.0,"Here's how I turned 30 days into 90:
- Repetition: Remember that every practice in life must be done in a conscious way and with repetition; the latter tells you what your body should do and how to correctly do it, the first how to be aware and take the most out of any practice; this will not only teach you how to better practice, but how to be here and now, to be in this moment, the only one that truly exists. I repeated each class 3 times before going to the next, just to take the most out of each day and to do things correctly. This allows you to get a better knowledge of the basics and prepares your body to the most challenging postures.

5646.0,I just wanna cry. This stuff looks so simple but I'm in so much pain. 50lbs overweight (due to a tumor called an insulinoma. It cause hyperinsulinemia which causes massive weight gain. No diet or excercise can get rid of it. Waiting for them to locate the tumor to remove it) but anyway. I can fold my legs like. Immense pressure in my ankles and behind my knees (the fat feels likes it's being squeezed to the point where it's gonna burst and it feels like I'm cutting off my circulation) and also so much is done with the hands and wrists. Mine must be super weak cause I can put hardly any pressure on them. Not my fingertips either. I can barely get by if ball my hands into fists. Hurts like hell but only then am I able to do anything that requires it. What can I do to fix these issues? I had my heart set on starting yoga this year.

This is so wired, I came back to this a year after I first started doing yoga with you, I've experienced a lot of things during this year, It was fast and slow at the same time, I opened myself to new things after taking this risk, and not necessarily in a bad way, I mean that I never had something to stick to in my daily life, I didn't have something that gives me the power to wake up in the morning. So basically I started this journey aiming to change at least one of my bad habits, It was just a small simple goal at the beginning, and It grow up effectively in a way that was unexpected, I was just going for it without thinking of any results, and I feel like the way I used to see things has changed so much, I see the world in a deep different way and that decision was a huge part of it, I really needed something to lead the way for me, and it was a huge step that I will never regret, Im so grateful for what have, what I had, or would have, every little thing has an effect on me. For me its really hard to hold on to my beliefs and opinions, and everything seems to be just a great lie that everyone believes, But yoga... I know its real .. I know that what I feel is real, the moment that I have with myself is real, and I cant really tell you what does this mean to me, having something that is true and not an illusion.. Is not easy at all. Im going to say ""Thank You"" cuz all this is a teeny tiny part of what I feel, and that word completes the rest of it, I can feel this moment right now and I have the need to cry but its not coming out, maybe next time..... Im so grateful for you sweet Adriene, and I wish I could be so lucky to live with you every single day for the rest of my life, LOVE YOU❤❤❤

I know consistency is the key and I know that as I continue to practice I will see so many benefits however I still find that I am unable to be consistent.

Additionally, some of her instruction, has allowed me to feel so much more comfortable in poses I thought I had mastered pretty well.  It is interesting and amazing that even through my computer screen, I feel such a peaceful connection with her instruction.  THANK YOU ADRIENE!",UggZltVeJL7ktHgCoAEC,0.0,4.0,2015-06-30T00:59:43Z,0.999800980091095
24.0,"Hey fellow beautiful people! This is exam season and with the mounting stress, anxiety and pressure, I decided to do this challenge to keep me physically fit and less stressed. Hope this comment helps me to be accountable and hopefully motivate someone too. Here's my journey so far!

DAY 01- To be honest, it was quite REWARDING to lay down at the end, with the sense of pride to go through the practice but I had to literally push myself so hard to go on. I was trying to get to the next thing every moment and it was much more difficult than I expected to take things slowly and not rush😔

DAY 02- (attempt #1) I was DYING. I couldn't even complete it. I lack arm strength and my spine is in a horrible condition, making the planks and downward facing dog poses unbearably painful. In addition to that, my feet hurt so much in the beginning under the weight of my body. It made me truly realize how out of shape I really am and makes me worry since I am still too young to not be able to do simple poses. I feel incredibly guilty and demotivated since I had to give up at around 20 minutes of practice but I will try to redo this tomorrow, when I'd be hopefully more energetic and motivated
(attempt #2)- I didn't have time in my schedule to fit in the 30 minutes session and was over all too tired. I feel incredibly guilty for skipping the day ugh.
(attempt #3) Finally finished the 2nd day and feel so motivated, accomplished and overall just so GOOD. The first ten minutes were absolute torture, but being able to finish the session and go through the initial pain, I felt so proud and relaxed as I lay in the shavasana pose. In my opinion, doing this in the morning with the sun streaming through the windows was much easier than at late night and was also more fulfilling to start my day productively with some self care.

DAY 03- Today's session was a whole lot easier and shorter(10 minutes less from the previous one) and the simpler, less painful exercises made the session go by so damn FAST. I couldn't even believe it was over when it was, I wasn't even sweating or being out of breath, which makes sense as this was focused on balance. My balance is absolutely horrendous and the stiffness of my body alarming. I hope to get better by being consistent and I'm glad Adrienne gave us this easier practice to motivate me into keep going, if today was like yesterday, I would have honestly given up but thankfully it wasn't!

DAY 04- I feel like the sessions are getting progressively easier and shorter? Although I'm not quite complaining. The practice was a breeze and I feel more ready to tackle today's exam!

DAY 05- I can't even believe this session was over when it was! It was so short and easy, although I do feel like despite this being for fun and relaxation, I should take this more seriously and push myself a little more than I am rn to see improvement.

DAY 06- I had to take so many breaks today, it was really painful but rewarding. My belly hurt, gave the abdominal muscles a good workout yep. Wow I have completed 1/5th of the challenge! Can't wait to do more.

DAY 07 (attempt 1)- I couldn't do it today because I felt really tired and sick. Looking forward to do it tomorrow tho!
(attempt 2)- this was the most sweating I ever did in this challenge. I had to take sooo many BREAKS it's embarrassing. The side plank was so extremely painful that i tried to do it once and my body screamed in pain, I feel unhappy that I skipped the side planks but oh well. Everyday I realize how far behind I truly am in my body care. My core strength and upper body strength is literally negligible and I can't do push ups for the life of me. I wish I could do push ups😣

DAY 08- (attempt one) was like 10 minutes in and was bored out of my mind and couldn't focus with disturbing intrusive thoughts swirling around my mind. Will try again tomorrow",UgzsKTLVwtQUmLYHfG94AaABAg,1.0,3.0,2022-02-20T11:06:37Z,-0.26741699250866313

I would give it a go once in awhile but just didn't find it (not Adrienes videos just randoms). Life got in the way, I put me to the side. But today I came back to the videos to Adrienes yoga videos. I saw the ones I used to do and decided to start the 30 day one when I was new to yoga. And it was like I never lift. My body had became to tight, it'll hurt doing any poses. In the start I did feel it but not once did I think to give up, I was just happy! Thank you Adriene! Like really thank you!

But for anyone who's going to give this a go... Stick at it! It's great.

I'm a 35 year old construction worker with a bad back and this has been the best thing I've ever done. I felt an IMMEDIATE difference. I've tried physiotherapy, bowen therapy and osteopathy and none of them have come close to yoga, but they have emptied my wallet :)

My work was getting too much for me. My lower back problem, which i've had for 15 years, caused a hip problem, which caused a balance problem with in turn caused ankle problems.

I can't recommend yoga enough! None of your power yoga nonsense, that just seems like a contradiction. These videos by Ardiene are great. I got to day 9 without a problem then I went on holiday and only done one day. So when I returned after a week, I started over again.

However i finished all and I'm proud of myself, I feel strong, I feel that I can achieve what I want, my mental health as well as my body's health are improved. I got clarity in my everyday life, I got control over my breath. I know control my body, I used to feel bulky, like an elephant in a jewerly not anymore now and it's crazy how you can improve in just 30 days. If we talk about my appereance, as a man I gain weight over my belly and I definitely see a result there, still something that I have to work on but way more toned and the circumference is decreased for sure (some people even asked me if I lost weight) I see a change on my legs and my butt (my body type is skinny fat).

5005.0,I am starting tonight before I go to bed. I am middle aged and pretty stiff. I was practicing Yoga 3 yrs ago. I can't remember what all poses I had done. but I remember the one that hurt me. it was Downward Dog. my shoulder felt like a hot needle went into it and the pain lasted about 2 weeks. I've been scared to get back into it. however I come to realize it was my fault. they say the mind is the first to give up. so I pushed passed my mind and held the pose. Then my body started warning me It had enough. I didn't listen. I thought I should have been able to hold the pose longer. lesson learned. now I'm getting back to practicing Yoga. I'm a little nervous. Here's to day 1.,Uggtw5C2lii4iXgCoAEC,2.0,2.0,2017-06-28T01:14:55Z,-0.9983962178230286

277.0,"So, in April this year (2021), I decided that I wanted to try yoga. I've always wanted to try Yoga, but I've never actually done it before or ever attempted to do it. About mid-April, after my birthday, I went looking for a nice, beginner yoga video and found Adriene's channel, great! I found a nice and simple 20 min (give or take) beginner video, did it, and felt amazing afterward! So, I made it a routine that I would get up and do this 20-minute beginner yoga video each morning. I did this for about two and a half weeks solid with about 3 rest days in between total. And then (whether or not it was related to the yoga or whether I picked up a bag of shopping wrong) but gradually, I felt a seriously sharp pain in my lower back (I'm 24 by the way). I decided to take a few more rest days before doing yoga again but then decided that one more session might help stretch out whatever was hurting, so back to the 20-minute video I went. My god, the pain in my lower back grew sharper and sharper to the point I couldn't breathe without it hurting (I cried at least once every day for a week because whatever I had done hurt that much). Again, I have no idea whether it was yoga-related or whether I had done something else - I think it was picking up a bag of shopping - to aggravate my back; it was a gradual pain that developed rapidly, rather than came on immediately. 
So anyway, my lower back finally felt better about two months after the pain started in April, which takes us to about June 2021. We're in August now and I have been wanting to give yoga another try. I will admit, the pain (wherever it came from) scared me away from yoga. Maybe I don't do it as 'full-on' as I did the first time (as I said, I only did 20 mins in the morning and repeated that every morning bar one or two days, but everyone's body is different and perhaps that was too much for me). So, even though these 30-day videos by Adriene were posted in 2015, I've literally only just seen them today, and saw in the comments that people are saying 'If you're starting out/a beginner this is great.' 
I've got my fingers crossed, I've fished out the yoga mat that I bought back in April and I'm hoping this series of yoga will be good to me! I really, really want to do this and now that I feel I've recovered from my silly, sudden back pain, I want to give it another try. Wish me luck!!",UgxufgEOUPQfCo919n94AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2021-08-09T22:00:27Z,-0.21231916525381075

790.0,"I make these comments way too often on Chloe Ting challenges, but maybe with trying to make yoga part of my daily routine and this being way easier when my body is demanding easier workouts, I MAY keep up. We’ll see. For now my plan is to update as much as possible. Day [1/30] 

Day 1: this was super relaxing! I got a light sweat (which is so weird to hardly sweat during a workout tbh) and felt like I did good stuff for my body. I’m hoping this tones me up a lot and helps me lose weight I’ve gained in crappy eating (probably alongside other workouts too on other days when I feel I can), as I currently don’t even like looking at myself with or without clothes on in the mirror right now. Now let’s hope the other days are as nice as this. 

Day two: took an extra day (purely out of laziness tbh) but did this after I did a 2.3 mile walk/run & day one of Holly Dolke's 30 day challenge! It felt so good to stretch out my muscles & I still worked up a sweat. My arms shook some and I opted to rest my knee in the lunge for one leg because it's too tight to hold myself up the full time, but I did for the other leg. Overall so happy so far I've started this challenge.

But now I've been following your videos since over a week and am really enjoying the routine. One problem I do have is arthritis of my big toes so I'm unable to do planks and improvise by resting on my knees.

1178.0,"So yoga isn't for ageing grannies? Well that's what I thought but how wrong I was! I'm just revisiting this having completed day 30 today and wanted to go back to the beginning and do it all over again! I'm discovering Adriene has a ton of YouTube videos so now I'm off exploring. I wasn't a complete beginner but I had only done a couple of taster classes so was certainly no expert. I love the way Adriene teaches, she inspires confidence, helps with alignment with detailed descriptors and shows you lots of different levels (plus never makes you feel bad for not being able to do the more difficult stuff!). For me personally, my journey has been so progressive, I am way more flexible (I can sit cross-legged plus can now touch my toes) - might not seem much to some, but after spinal surgery many years ago, I count that as huge progress. I get the 'connection' and 'grounding' too, even the spiritual caught up with me a little. I think about the way I move more, my core is definitely strengthened but the biggest thing I got out of it is that I learned how to breathe! I'd thoroughly recommend giving this a go even if you don't do it every day -  I missed a couple of days, didn't beat myself up, got back on the mat and got on with it. Well worth it and totally inspiring x",Ugyu3ACRW4WBbRxr-Zt4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-06-30T08:57:04Z,0.993440568447113

1218.0,"Subscribed.😎 I’m doing this! I’ve been playing around with yoga and tai chi for a couple days recently trying different channels and different difficulties and personalities. I’ve had a mat and a book for awhile now n never had the space or time until recently. I moved out of the city back to the country with my parents and I’m still working but I’ve been wanting to get in better shape n take care of my body n mind, I’ve done a lot of physical spiritual & emotional damage to my body through my life with reckless sports stunts and drugs growing up and I’m getting older n it’s taken it’s toll, but I’m not ready to give up, I still struggle with addiction even though I’ve been clean from opiates for going on 5 years now soooo..I’m taking the challenge. I worked out n went running yesterday then worked this morning so I really really needed this, I’m becoming stronger n more aware of my body and I’m excited to take this journey. I know it’s just YouTube but I still feel a connection from you, your a good teacher, u helped me learn and relax and open up n play around a little n I like that. So I’m going to DO (or do not, there is no try) My Best and do the 30 day challenge. I kinda wish it was a live class even tho I probably can’t afford it but I just wanna say thank you, really. And I will “Pray (not2god or anything, myself, the universe maybe) Not for an easy life but the strength to endure a difficult one.” - Bruce Lee                                    and I will have fun.

I am almost 62 and have not really done much exercise after have a double bunionectomy almost 18 months ago. I not only couldn't do yoga, I have struggled with many exercise including walking, so I am hoping this will ease me back into yoga and other exercise I took for granted pre operation. Today was hard. I could not even do many of the moves. I couldn't get up from the mat for some sequences and although I currently feel OK after my first session, I know I will fell it later and tomorrow. But I will stick with it and will report in after each lesson. I really enjoy your presentation style, and the way you make me feel about my own abilities, especially as a middle aged person. I believe yoga will be my saving grace as I age and am glad I'm getting back on the bandwagon with you. Thank you Adriene.",UgxDfFKUlzrNHC6u4-p4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2020-06-11T22:44:26Z,0.9687368273735046

I must have been exceedingly mindful, because I went past a wall I had built up. My husband has been on a workout journey for 5 months now. He's gone from over 300 pounds to just over 280. I am 230 pounds. I've been worried that this isn't just a phase he's going through. He's actually doing this and he isn't stopping. I've been very stubborn and resisting his urges to get me doing it too. I've even been resentful of his new healthy habits. Even now, I'm not doing this yoga for him, or even as ""exercise"", although I do see the benefit. I'm doing it because work is stressful and I feel very tight by the end of the day.

I have gained so muh weight from just sitting and laying down doing nothing the whole day, spending all my days inside my dark bedroom alone. 

Now, I have realized my true calling, my true passion. And I figured I have to change myself first before I can even begin strengthening my capabilities in order to pursue my passion. 

Today is the first day of my 'changing my life' attempt. I do hope I get to continue with this because I enjoyed this 35 minutes of peace so much. Although I did feel tension in some places all over my body, I enjoyed more than I ever have in a month, and released so much sweat.

I should be able to follow along only with the oral instruction especially during hard or upside down poses but she tells you to do something more spiritually and not physically which is confusing to me (ie press the heart and release the heart at 17 min when she only puts her head on the mat).  I would enjoy clearer instruction because I always needed to look up when I usually am able to follow along easily.

I just completed it today and I circled back to this first video just to find my roots again, and I was so thankful as I was doing these movements because it made me really realise how much more flexible I have become, how deep my breathing has become (it is such a wonderful feeling!), how much more flexible my back and legs have become and how my arms have gotten stronger too. The back pain that I was constantly dealing with for the past 5 years have become almost unnoticeable!!! 

I am just so grateful for these videos and so happy that it helped me ease so gently and effectively into a healthier lifestyle. Thank you Adriene, for making these videos so gentle to follow and so superbly effective. Thank you especially for remaining totally accepting and always explaining throughout the process the various stages different people may be at and why its perfectly okay to have certain limitations. No matter my mood, coming to the mat, breathing deep and committing to these moves always made me feel better.

These beginner moves are easy, and I LOVE the one where you lay down, bring a knee to heart and cross it hip-wise in the opposite direction, I got a good *crack* on both sides this way.  Ahh, never ever did that move before.  As great as my body bar and warm-up movements are for my runs, THAT move was probably really good for me.

4881.0,"Good Morning World.

You may not know but I have been on (what seems like) a life long diet after a motorcycle crash. Also, I am one of those people who live to eat. That also make it a bit of a challenge.

Anyway, I have spent many years in and out of gyms, I hate it. I'm far from a gym junkie, its just one of those things I've needed to focus on. 

But I have always enjoyed classes, especially the yoga and Pilates classes. And found myself in them more than in the gym area itself. 

I have been totally off track for 18months now after two knee operations, and the last two gym's I have been at have not been appealing at all, with either awful or no available classes. 

I am changing gyms again. 

It's brand new but the new one doesn't open until the 7th of September. It also looks like the sort of classes I like to do wont be available. 

At least I know this in advance rather than going in and being let down, so I have found this YouTube page. 

The plan is to get up and do a yoga session, before the visit to the gym. And I have found this 30 Day Challenge.

This morning, I have completed day 1, and already, I feel fantastic. 

To the doubters, yoga is strangely amazing, give it a try. And that comes from a middle aged fat biker with knackered legs.

My aim is to post every day, just to say I have completed each stage of the challenge. This I will do on my Google+ page, any support would be greatly appreciated.

Have a great day world.

 tonight was my first day or night lol of Thirty days of yoga. I'm super excited for this journey. Although I'm a dancer, I despise working out.

4987.0,"I have been following your channel, sporadically, for awhile now. I love how you teach yoga! It is such an inspiration to me, and helped me on those days I decided to sit down and take a moment to myself. I have now been working out everyday, for almost two weeks (which, for me is the most consistent I have been with a workout for a LONG while!), and I have been using your videos throughout this time to challenge and relax my body and muscles. Thank you for what you do with your time!
Also, I just started this 30 days of yoga challenge yesterday, and I have promised myself that I will stick to it this time! No skipping days and no being lazy. I am fully dedicated to this path I am taking, and I WILL improve myself with each step (pose) I take! I used to be so active when I was in school, and now I want to get back into shape for my own sake. I want to feel energized, healthy, and happy again! So, thank you again for your videos and your challenges.
p.s. Check out my channel sometime if you can! I will have some new quality videos coming soon, and would be flattered if you subscribed to me.",UggvbpzkKlBKdXgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2017-07-02T15:44:08Z,0.999471127986908

4992.0,"About three weeks ago I underwent knee surgery, specifically reconstruction of a torn anterior cruciate ligament. As you can imagine rehab is a lot of lying down in awkward positions due to reduced mobility of the knee, so other parts of my body started getting really sore, especially my back. After this exercise however, even though I couldn't do like half of it since I'm still recovering, I feel like my bones can breathe again. Really awesome. For anyone that's recently experienced any type of orthopedic surgery, I highly recommend you check out this video and do as much of it as you safely and comfortably can. It's a great way to prevent damage to the other parts of your body and add to a really holistic healing process that targets your whole body.",Ugi-8cYcykk_h3gCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2017-06-30T09:07:39Z,0.9986616373062134

5412.0,"For those who are still debating whether to start - first of all - it doesn't hurt like you think it will. Let's start with that. I am currently at day 7 practice, but i'm practicing for 9 days with Adriene - some days I did twice, and other I did 2 videos in a row - some are just 15 min & I found it not enough for me). And I was a couch potato for about a year before starting. What I've noticed so far: 

My back pain is gone - because of the stretches but also because I started to naturally assume proper posture while walking and sitting. The same with neck pains. 

Downward facing dog is a $%^^$, but only at the beginning, you'll enjoy it later, trust me. 

My daily attitude is better, I am calmer (highly stressful job) and I feel more creative and happy. 

I'm trying to quit smoking, and - this might sound strange - but breathing exercises helps with the cravings. 

My arms and legs feel stronger and though my body doesn't look more fit and muscles toned, I am getting there. 

I genuinely can't wait for the time in a day I reserved for yoga. It's an ultimate relax time!

If you have started and feel discouraged - do it slowly, breathe, huge breathes - it can take you mind off strains in your muscles and it actually helps eliviate them. 

Enjoy it!",Ugi5bGQQ2YqOWHgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2017-02-21T18:52:45Z,0.9960746765136719

I have been a self proclaimed sloth for years. I tried yoga a few years ago and although I loved it I stopped. 
I want to thank you for posting this 30 day series. I am now on Day 12 (12 consecutive days!!! haaha) and this sloth is slowly finding her way back to a little peace in the morning with your help. The pace is perfect for beginners as well as those that tend to give up because of not being able to ""keep up""
Thank you for posting this and I can't wait to continue with your through the 30 days and beyond.

It just really struck me how very different yoga is from other movement practices.

DAY 1:

So today was my first day, I don't care about doing this in a 30-day month period, I'll just do this from today and into the next month. The practice felt mostly easy, but I did have a light sheen of sweat on my face. Most poses posed no challenges though breathing calmly and getting all the exhales to mirror my moves was hard. The cycle legs and downward dogs were toughest. That final stretch (hug your knee to your heart part) nearly gave me a cramp in my inner left thigh, though my right thigh sailed smoothly. Need to open up my left thigh in general. I had fun, it was relaxing had some challenge. Finding it really hard to keep an upright posture after the workout though, I'm almost falling into the ""Mr burns"" posture if I relax my back.Looking forward to Wednesday and part 2!",UgjldpkPdz0ziXgCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-02-03T04:31:53Z,-0.9828284382820129

I don't want to give up the benefits of th8ings like downward dog, but even if I am on all 4's for an extended period, there is a lot of pain. Very brief bouts seem to be tolerable though. 2.

Day 1

- Felt dizzy after yoga (probably from lowering my head more than usual)
- Difficulty with the various poses as I'm not familiar (It looked so easy but I'm not flexible, the back of my knee literally hurts from that half standing dog)
- Neck hurts from craning to see my laptop screen (I'm already wearing earpods but since I have to see the poses)

I absolutely loved it and after the first 6 or 7 days when my shoulders didn’t hurt so bad I started to really look forward to it.  I was nowhere as graceful or as strong as Adrienne but you can get great benefits from yoga no matter how well yo do it.  I’m continuing to do yoga every day and plan to start a new 30 day challenge soon.,UgwZw9yj665brs8ZUPZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-05-01T14:21:37Z,0.9988362193107605

446.0,"Day 1 Challenge: Yoga With Adriene - Ease Into It. This was a good way to get a fresh fitness challenge started. It's been a long time since I've moved my body with deliberation and focus on myself. It felt rather awkward initially, but I listened and kept up with it. This routine is a good way to get back into the swing of things and come to terms with self awareness and moving deliberately. There is a lot of delicious stretching of just about every part of your body. And there were several moments that had me shaking and produced a burn. Got a good comfortable ache in my core. However, it was not a complicated routine to follow. That's a good thing on day one and with a video titled ""Ease Into It"". Feels good to get moving again. Namaste.

So far it's been pretty simple not too rigorous not too exhausting. Through the breathing techniques and just being in the moments im able to listen to my body and find where it hurts the most where it's the most tense going through this video I slowly become more flexible more relaxed in less in pain in certain positions. I don't feel too sore now I hope the rest of the 30 days will be just as relaxing. Because of my job I don't know if I can do these yoga classes 30 day straight I might have to do two videos a week.

476.0,"Hi Adriene. Exactly a year ago, this was the first video I ever watched on your channel. It was one of the first few times I'd ever tried yoga. Through this challenging year, a constant in my life has been my YWA practice. I honestly cannot thank you enough for making these videos publicly available. No matter my mood, or need there's a video on your channel for it. Outside of giving me a way to regularly exercise indoors, practicing yoga through your videos has helped me manage stress and anxiety. I can't tell you how light and calm I feel sometimes when I am in Shavasana. I used to consider that pose as just relaxing but with time, I've realised how important even that is! 

I guess this is my attempt of expressing my gratefulness for this f channel. I can say that following YWA videos regularly for the past  lyear has made my life a lot better. Outside of just the yoga, some of things you say in your videos has made me realise the importance of accepting and also being kind to oneself.

I’m starting my journey on February 6 2021 and I hope that this because more of a relief to do when I need a minute to myself than feeling like it’s a chore to do it. Thank you for listening to my little spiel. Congrats to everyone’s success and for those who are starting this year, we got this and you have partners in this journey",Ugy_FzW1hJXepe9DMwZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-06T11:57:40Z,0.9795788526535034

>> Day 1 (Nov 18, 2020) - This was my first attempt to yoga and even though I'm 28 and not overweight it still felt quite difficult for me as a total beginner. There are several poses I couldn't do. But overall those 34min seemed like 5min and I felt at peace and relaxed by the end of the session. I might try and get used to ""Day 1"" before jumping to ""Day 2"".

845.0,"I think this was the first 30 Day challenge that I set out to do when I first found the channel. Over a year ago. One of my 2020 goals was to do yoga 1/2 of the year, so 6 of the 30 day challenges (one every 2 months) and a handful of random ones. I have kept up with that goal all year and am so amazed at the improvements I’ve seen from the first time I tried this challenge.

I was one of those people who would say NOPE to the planks and settle for the tabletop position. I couldn’t fathom being ‘light on my hands’ in lunges! This time, I went for ALL the planks, lifted my arms in the lunges (mostly) and can touch the ground in my forward folds.

I have gained a little over 10 pounds since the start of the pandemic from being more inactive than I’m used to. I really want to get the weight off and just generally get a little healthier. 
I live in Minnesota so we have some harsh winters that I normally have to stay inside for. Generally from spring through fall we are very active. But because of the pandemic, that made things very difficult as I had to stay home because of my health.

1142.0,"My goal with this series is to become the type of person who shows up for my physical body and mind. I struggle with finding consistancy.  And it doesn't matter what kind of lofty goals I have unless I perfect the art of showing up and make it into a habit. 

Day 1:
I finished all the way through and plan to do day 2 tomorrow at 6:00am right here in my livingroom. Reward for day 1: my body feels stretched out and light.

Day 2: I got up at 5:45am. I completed day two. I'll do the same for day 3. I'll wake up at 6:00am tomorrow and do the 3rd day practice here in my livingroom.

Day 3: I woke up at 5:45am, but didn't get to do Yoga till 8:30am. I'm glad I showed up for the 3rd day. Tomorrow I'll wake up at 5:45am and  do the 4th day practice here in my livingroom.

Day 4: I woke up at 5:30am. I showed up and got it done. I'll do Day 5 tomorrow at 6:00am here in my livingroom.

Day 5: Done! I'll be back tomorrow at  5:30am.

Day 6: Done at 6:am. I'll be back tomorrow at 5:am

Day 7: Done. I got it done at 6:00pm. Tomorrow I'll be back to my morning routine at 5:30am.

Day 8: Done! I'm amazed I kept showing up. Keep it up me! I'll be back tomorrow at 5:30am

Day 9: Done at 7:00am. I'll be back here tomorrow at 6:00am.

Day 10: Done before 7:00am. Same schedule for tomorrow.

Day 11: Done before 6:30am. I'll be back tomorrow :)

Day 12: Done at 6:00am. This might be a record for me. I don't really stick to any physical exercise habits for this many consecutive days.  I'll be back tomorrow. And I'm getting up between 5:00am - 6:00am. I'm in quarantine; I don't have to. But, this makes for productive days.

Day 13: Done before 6:00am. Not only am I showing up everyday, but this is helping me get my day going and not sleep in during these quarantine days.

Day 14: Done at 5:59am. I'm on my way to becoming someone who works out every day.

Day 15: Done! Consistency: a work in  progress. Pleased so far.

Day 16: Done! I'm starting to believe I will be someone who will do some sort of stretching in the morning for the remainder of my life.

Day 17: Done.

Day 18: Done.

Day 19: Done. For less brain overload, I'm writing done stuff I need to do as soon as it crosses my mind. I feel lighter already.  Book: Getting Things Done.

Day 20: Got it done. Also, currently almost done with the book ""Getting Things Done""

Day 21: Done.

Day 22: Done.

Day 23: Done 6:00am . I'll back tomorrow at 5:00am. My moto is consistency over intensity.

Day 24: done. So relaxing

Day 25: Done ✔

I have been dieting for almost a month and have lost 10 lbs. but I want to reach my real goal that is below 200lbs. The problem is I have painful varicose veins and I have arthritis in my knees so it is difficult for me to bend my knees all the way to my center. I want to know if I can still do the exercise without bending my knees to my center. Is yoga still effective if I don’t cross my legs that much? Thank you  for listening to me!!

1234.0,"I wanted to start the challenge two days ago, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it out of sheer demotivation/lack of discipline/laziness. I suffer from an anxiety disorder and today was one of the worst days I have ever had. I was straight up shaking, had an elevated heart rate while resting and my body was very tense. I don‘t use any kind of medication, so I was at a loss of what to do since my usual coping methods from CBT were not working today. I remembered doing your videos for anxiety and stress about a year ago so I thought, why not start the challenge? So I did. The first half was very uncomfortable for me - not because of difficult poses, but sitting still, mindful breathing and focusing in the moment was so hard for me to do. My anxiety symptoms include shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded and overall physical weakness, which made it so much harder. My CBT includes observing what I‘m feeling and letting go of any wish of controlling my feelings and this practice helped me IMMENSELY! I can‘t thank you enough for guiding me through noticing how my body is feeling and making me feel very comfortable. I can‘t wait to see what Day 2 has in store for me.

Adriene doesn't push us newbies too far and seems to know exactly when you've had enough. I started feeling a whole lot better after the first few days and for the first time in my life have found an exercise routine that I don't have to force myself to do. My only regret is that I missed the Start Here video (yes there's a video before Lesson 1). Do yourself a favour and show up on the mat even when you don't feel like it because you do feel great after you're done a lesson.

And one team in particular, Nekoma, has a saying “all plays connect” and yoga reminds me a lot of that idea. This is my first time trying yoga and I like that I was able to connect it back to something I really love. I love the ideas that fuel each team from sharpening individual strengths to versatility to the flow of movement, and being able to connect it to yoga makes me feel like this challenge is doable because I like the frame of mind that everything is connected even if it’s not apparent.",UgxHrH49ir2t9UVk4LR4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-06-05T16:11:23Z,0.9994518160820007

Day 8...crow??.  I want to progress but I could use a more accessible start.  I love your teaching style and personality so much.

1699.0,"I started today. I have been sleeping at the wrong time for the longest time. Ever since the quarantine, I haven't been able to discipline myself. I started to let go of all things I did for my wellness. 

On this day, April 1, 2020, I woke up at 5 am because I was getting bit by a mosquito. 

I lit a candle and started my day with a 10 minute meditation. 
Then I started day one on this 30 day challenge. 

I noticed that my hamstrings were especially tight because I played volleyball with my brother two days ago without warm up, cool down,  or any sort of stretching. 
This was disheartening as I have been practicing karatedo for almost 10 years now. I haven't had training in months. I let go. 

I also noticed tightness on my right upper back. It went away as I went through the day 1 yoga challenge. Then, by the end of the practice, I noticed tightness on my left upper back and shoulder. It is still there at the moment but I am positive that it will be much better in the next few days. 

The next thing I noticed about my body today is that I have difficulty breathing in and out fully along with breathing in and out in sync with my movements. I don't know when to breathe in and out. 

I didn't find it comfortable to swing on my back to massage my spine as my tailbone hurt. 

Lastly, following the challenge with a mobile phone and not seeing every movement can pose as a difficulty since I do not know what to do next all the time even as Adrienne was speaking but I made do with it. 

I wish there was a hologram that could follow where my eyes went haha! 

Anyhow, thank so much Adrienne!",UgyOmXE098WXfzjyGpB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-03-31T23:13:22Z,-0.9957568049430847

I am continuing to enjoy your various videos and would like to get my husband interested.

He is 71 years old and has a metal knee but not incapacitated as he swims, gym’s and walks our dog daily.  Do you have any programme for older men that are not too extreme?

Thank you in advance for your help and response to my enquiry.

Today when I woke up, after just 1 beginner yoga session, I felt like I had worked out for the first time again...I was a bit sore in my butt cheeks!! Lol!! But In a good way, and very surprised! I focused on the “sensation not shape” idea and let it serve me, rather being a slave to it (as w/other workouts) and felt incredible! I didn’t know til this morning how badly I must have needed this! Now that I know, I’ll definitely trade in my weights & running shoes for a yoga mat ON A REGULAR BASIS.

I don’t quite understand some of your vocabulary: “send your breath,” “extend though the crown,” “breathe into the back body,” “ease your heart,” “keep that connection to the earth,” “lift the knee caps,” “grounding through the back body,” and a few more. I’m not a yogi at all so I’m trying to listen to your instructions while at the same time trying to keep my eyes closed and my mind relaxed, but when you say such phrases I get a little lost.",UgxDEaNaUpJrwvy5MAB4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-07-03T05:35:33Z,-0.9658827781677246

And yes, I've been a bit angry at myslef that I couldn't do some of the poses and different positions, but Adrienne has several videos for complete beginners in which you can exercise your balance in a less alert manner, go check them out. But it feels awesome! so much better than going to the gym where it feels like you're  just punishing your body. I don't have a yoga mat, I'm using my carpet. I don't have a yoga block, I just use a big heavy book. You can improvise.

2647.0,"to each their own, but not for me. I've been doing yoga for about 6 years, and i often like to come back to these challenge series because every time you still learn from other people. for instances, six years I've been doing yoga, but when you said ""why don't we clasp our fingers in the other direction"" for the opposite side of a stretch I was mind blown. I've been doing left/right variations of postures this whole time and had never thought of that. What I didn't like was she gives too many options. Like, yes, as an intermediate/adept you know you can modify postures to suite yourself but for beginners it is extremely confusing to hear ""Walk up to a forward fold, from here you can fingerwalk to either side or you can shake the head yes, or-"" that's a lot of information for a novice to process all at once. For the sake of a ""Day 1"" challenge i think the instructor should take more of a firm linear approach. Don't give beginners lots of options, they don't know what to do with them. Let them start getting muscle memory before dropping this way and that ways on them.",UgwiusfyKjdkbTTPjVV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-05-09T10:59:46Z,-0.9922864437103271

We started by doing your videos twice a week, then went to a place in town once a week. Well, this surgery put a damper in our practice. Though going to PT now for my foot, I've finally been given the ok to start my yoga practice again.  Ouch,  I'm all kinds of stiff!  I started today with this video.

What's most important, though, is that it really helped me get some positive energy going in my life and I genuinely feel more centered, healthier and stronger, less muscle aches and I'm sleeping better.

I was a very active kid growing up playing different sports and whatnot, but for the past 5 years I've stopped playing sports and moving around so I've gained about 60 pounds in those years... I feel horrible, I feel tired, hungry, and unmotivated almost everyday. Trying to fit into clothing and seeing how the size goes up is pretty sad and depressing at some times.... But I finally decided to give yoga a tried, I been doing it for a week and I feel so much better about myself and I am more conscious about my eating habits and I gotta say I regret not trying out yoga sooner. I feel better and I hope to stick with it for as long as possible and lose the weight slowly but surely. Good luck guys!

Even if I feel like not doing it for the day and come up with all kinds of excuses like, I'm tired with no energy or I want to just be lazy and binge watch the rest of you tube because I feel unmotivated, I always just start the practice at least.

It was a little difficult at first as I was new to Yoga. But after 13 days I can say for sure that I feel a lot better. My body is more toned and became more flexible. My metabolic rate has increased. Yoga makes me want to eat only healthy food while keeping me positive and happy all day. Glad I started it and I am sure I am going to do yoga everyday.
In the beginning, not being able to do simple yoga poses may frustrate you. But trust me, it gets better every day. And by day 5 or so you will be able to do all those poses with ease.",UgzP-MFSUCgxPVwuG-d4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-12-03T19:00:38Z,0.9986244440078735

3229.0,"I started these series 12 days ago. Told myself to try and do one each day and alow myself an 'off' day every now and then, but never two in a row. 
Did Day 1 and Day 2. On the third day I looked up video's about the different poses because I was feeling a bit lost (have zero knowledge on yoga). 
Then started from Day 1 again. Finished Day 6 today.
I'm feeling very motivated and am curious how I'll improve. Already I notice a difference in flexibility and strenght. Every pose and transition is noticably smoother.
Since the sixth day, I've started doing two video's a day: one of the 30 Days-series + one on shoulder, neck or back exercices. Main reason is because after one video I'm still in the mood for more yoga (those 20/30mins really fly by!) + my back, shoulders and neck  have been a real issue for years.
Usual time of day is after we've put the kid to bed. Nice and quiet in the house.
An aditional positive side-effect: normally I have to fight the urge to snack in front of the tv. After my yoga-hour, that craving is absent. Is that strange?
I also notice that I'm constantly minding my posture during the day and try to relax and breathe when things get stressy at work, in the car drive,...

So, so far I'm really exited about having finally started basic yoga and am sharing these video's with my friends.

I have issues with my back and sacral area so after a while I thought I would never really be able to do yoga. Adriene's YouTube videos have changed all that.. (and no pain!). She transitions slowly and explains different modifications for those who need them. I also love that she is relaxed about using props like blankets or yoga blocks to help get into each pose properly. Adriene makes it clear that we need to do what is right for us on an individual level.

I love Adriene's approach to the various moves that make them all possible to do. I have tried and failed at yoga so many times before because it seemed that even beginner classes were just too much for me. I couldn't hold the downward dog long enough or my big tummy got in the way of a supposedly ""simple"" move. I am 5' 5"" and 220 LBS. Not ideal. I like to do challenges and this month I am challenging myself to meditate every day, so I figured why not give this another go seeing as yoga ties right into meditation. I am so glad to have found this 30-day course! I'll be posting updates on each oth the videos to track my progress. Today I could just touch my toes with slightly bent knees, but interlacing my fingers over my head was a bit of a struggle. I had to bend my elbows or risk choking myself with my own fat. I must admit that wiggling around is a great tip when doing the plank and downward dog. I could never have held it in a still position.

I didn't even realize it was over until the next video automatically started. :)) I don't think I can find a yoga instructor this kind, open minded, and sympathetic in real life (especially in Turkey lol).

  She also has this attitude that neither forces you to do something that would hurt your body, nor lets you just give in and throw the towel whenever you feel a little pressure. She helps you to find your own rhythm, even if it's my first time trying I still felt the tension and the stress of the day going off my body and flying away...

Good thing no one was there to see ;). I couldn't stop for almost five whole minutes!  Do you have any idea how hard it is to breathe through your nose when it's all stuffed up from crying?

Started this challenge on 26th of June in 2018 on Tuesday (yes very random date to start) because I really need this since I'm going through tuff times and I just need moments for myself. I need time to focus on me and time to forget about outside world. Honestly (not sure if Adriene is going to read this but still) this was very spiritual and I feel almost emotional after just the 1st day. I was really able to take time on myself and I'm definitely going to continue this and come back here after these 30 days and hopefully notice the difference within my body and mind compared to day 1 💪

Only suggestion is to watch it through first (even if you do it on double speed on mute) to get an idea so you don't have to look. Recommended this to a friend who's never done yoga and who hurt her back last year and because it was slow she said she felt totally safe.

3945.0,"I am getting medial knee pain in the sitting position at the beginning, it gets worse when leaning forward or trying to sit tall, I am pretty sure it's due to super tight adductors, the muscles running down the inside of the leg, so I have tried to find ways of stretching the adductors but I can't seem to be able to make them loosen off. When I try stretching them, the stretch feels more like a strain on the ligaments/tendons rather than the muscles themselves. I feel as though something is inhibiting my ability to stretch these muscles, it could be due to a muscle weakness or tightness elsewhere.

3976.0,"I'm glad that you started off the video slowly working stretches into the positions and didn't throw in sun salutations first video, however I think you started to speed up and didnt describe enoigh of what your body was doing so in the akward poses like being completely bent over i had to kink my neck and loose positions multiple times just to rewind and see what you were doing. personally had a hard time following the ""yoga lingo"" when you had us in downward dog after running pose  and suddenly straight back position I don't know how many times I had to rewind and see what your transitions were. And when you stood up and said and down your center, you went all the way down to the ground I had no idea that what you were doing and had to get out of my form again.. I honestly think if you took a little more time to describe what your body was doing instead of just using the Yoga lingo like ""melt back into"". It's poetics and all but not very helpful for someone who has never done yoga before and is trying to get the positions right and having to.kink their neck to look at the screen to keep up while trying to keep relaxed composition. Overall though I think you added some greatly helpful little tips like pedalling, that no other instructor has mentioned and I was able to completely touch my toes with my legs straight that usually takes days to achieve, after not doing yoga for so long!

I have a fused foot where I can't bend my toes or go all the way down on a lunge but i do modify as much as possible.I went through some difficulties in my life but the worse has passed.We all have a story but you can't let the bumps or curve balls in our lives effect our health. I choose to stay happy and bring my awareness and practice to positive vibes and energy.I go to church on Sundays and thank god for the blessings everyday in my life. I don't judge the yogis and their beliefs and don't understand really al the language that is used during the practice. I love how it's peaceful and positive so I respect your practice it's all good vibes. My daughter introduce your video to me and I have to say all the videos I have watched you have thee best videos xoxo.You have no pressure ,no judjement,your always about everyones journey at our own pace thats what we don't get in class.So thank you for allowing me to enjoy my practice at home where I'm defintley comfortable.I believe we all can do this. My breathing is very difficult to understand but you constanly explain each move,also modifying each move without pressure.

4292.0,I was so excited to start day 1 today as a commitment to making some changes in my life. I started out feeling great and following along but as I went into poses and movements that required lifting my weight or being on my knees I felt a lot of pain and discomfort. Some of these movements and poses were just impossible for me. I tried to be patient through it and expected that Adrienne would provide alternatives to things like straight planking or to shorten the lunges and things like that but she didn't. I found myself feeling increasingly frustrated and getting behind. What started as a morning calming and centering thing became a crying heap on the floor because i felt stupid for thinking I could do it and feeling sad that I couldn't. Adrienne might say it's for everyone but it's really not. Especially not for larger people.,Ugy6JfeLyEHjSXQpxGN4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-01-08T11:48:45Z,-0.998501181602478

To be able to stay healthy mentally in today's society I believe meditation combined with physical training is the best alternative, Yoga happily offers both and therefor I have to admit that Yoga is the key to finding peace today. Meditation is highly underestimated. People today focus so much on their appearance and physique instead of how they mentally feel. If you have a great physique but you are not mentally healthy, then you might want to consider spending some time finding your inner peace. I believe that most people in our world today have the ability to feel much more healthier if they just put some time on peaceful meditation instead of deadlifts and squats.

I dont have a yoga mat yet (which my knees and ankles didnt find appealing lol). what kind of thickness of the mat do you recommend? or can you recommend a specific company or specific mat? does it matter at all?

I have a condition that causes me to faint and jumping right into an exercise routine can be scary for me because of this, but I have faith that by taking it one day at a time, I'll be able to enjoy getting back to what used to be routine for me. When I was pregnant with my daughter, I almost miscarried a few times and the doctors insisted I take it easy and try not to exercise too much; my long walks were enough and it wasn't worth the risk. I absolutely agreed that I didn't want to risk it, so I did what they told me. Now, my daughter will be two next month and I've had a hard time getting back on track with my body.

I have a shortened muscle in my left leg and I managed to do a very spaced out downward dog but then when we had to walk up to meet our hands, I was completely stumped. I wish you could have done something where over a few days you stretched your muscles until you could walk up to meet your hands. I know this video is quite old and I'm new to your channel, but could you think about doing a series for people with shortened muscles or injuries? I know I sound really picky but it would really help because the stretches I do for my leg don't seem to be working and my friend recommended yoga to me.

Doing a 30 day challenge search produced a lot of similar videos and for whatever reason, I was drawn to this channel. This is day one of my yoga goal and I am so happy it brought me here.

Its hard to take a class as chronically ill and disabled many yrs since 20's. I am so grateful to you.  I have begun many healing practices and finding you has changed my life. You keep me breathing, body aligned and remind me how to do positions properly. I start every day with you now. I honestly can't function until I finish a class with you. Day 1 of 30 days is my favorite still. Love that you did upper back pain one and hip one as I have fibro and myofascial pain syndrome so getting stretch to certain hardened painful areas is tough.

5365.0,"Just did day 1.  I knew yoga is hard when you first start and i was not wrong. I basically have never worked out other then going to the gym with friends once in a really long time. i use to be kinda fit a few years ago but lately iv been tired all day im super stiff, I get stiff necks all the time because how barley active i am. Working out is a challenge due to my Severe Hemophilia B. Working out woth weights is not the best option for me as anything high impact is not good for someone with Hemophilia. Yoga is very low impact and everyone recommends it for me. Day 1 kicked my ass. I cant plank for more then 8 seconds with out the muscles in my body go all violent shaking and then collapsing. I think ill stick with day 1 for a few days. No need for me to go to fast. I also have to work on breathing. Its hard to focus on breathing. This 30 day yoga challenge will be my first goal even if it takes me 90. Im sick of feeling weak and winded all the time. Im 25 years old 5'5"" and 135 pounds. My ultimate goal is to add muscle but with my hemophilia i must take it slow and steady.

This morning, for the first time, I did two classes (days 3 and 4) one after the other, without falling over (I'm still wobbling), or having to stop for a break, and I am starting to feel the difference as I gradually deepen/refine the poses and master the breathing.

I just completed day 1 and I feel really good. You have become my favorite yoga teacher in 30 minutes! You reminded me that yoga is fun and to laugh at myself as well. Your lack of ego and sense of humor is so refreshing; as a yogi coming back to the beginning, I feel a lot of judgement in classes and have found a lot of pretentious teachers. And your of humor made me feel laugh and be okay becuase I can't hold poses for long right now and that is totally okay. You also do a great job helping me come back to my breath and smiling when I shake because I know it's beautiful pranayam running through my body connecting me to the universe. Thank you!

5724.0,"Hiya. I decided to give Yoga a try since I've been suffering from tense, stiff shoulders and also stiff and sore masseter. It's at a point where 80% of the time I can't even try to relax if I just sit down and try to breathe calmly. It doesn't help. Even worse, when I drift towards dream land sometimes I'll have sudden twitch movements in my jaw causing my teeth to clash against each other...sometimes only quietly, but other times so loud it wakes me up (seriously). The latter scenario rarely ever happens, though, according to my significant other my teeth only clash against each other with small force most of the time but very frequently (I don't notice). It's called bruxism but mine is minor. Jaw and shoulders are connected and I'm thinking that my shoulders are probably stiff because my masseter is. If you have any Yoga poses to remedy exactly that issue I'm having, please please let me know.

Now, I don't have a mat and don't have space to accomodate one - I barely have space in my room to practice to begin with. But all Yoga studios unfortunately are too far away, so I'll make the best out of what I've got.

I tried following your instructions and overall I can say it helped. While it didn't remove the stiffness entirely, it did ease it a bit. And considering I probably only did half of the poses correctly that's something :)

I felt some pain and discomfort in my knees during poses that require you to put body weight on them. Also, I'm not sure if some of the poses where quite some weight rests on the palms is really healthy for the hands. Perhaps I'm just doing it wrong?
In any case, I'll be back tomorrow for day 2. :)",Ugguh_trgV8QjHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-12-06T11:29:56Z,-0.9844304919242859

5831.0,"So I did say one of the yoga challenge! I'm really excited I have been searching for an instructor I like and you are awesome. I'm fairly a beginner in the practice. I noticed that my right hip is extremely tight and doing ""Indian style"" for lack of a better term is somewhat painful. At least until I can stretch and release. My question is if using a block in this position do I place in under my sits bones to ease pressure at least until I'm more flexible? I currently can even have my knees touch the ground and I'm hoping with practice to be able to achieve that. It's the little things.

Rant aside; is it ok to use a (quite thin) mattress instead?

5970.0,"I have had many medical issue's come on over the last 5 yrs.  I had the gastric bypass in 2011 and the surgeon botched my surgery.  At first I was doing well.. going to the gym 5 to 6 days a week, then I started noticing pain in my shoulder which turned into 3 yrs of hell with severe frozen shoulder.  Then my left leg started feeling strange.. Neuropathy.. then my left hip.. arthritis which now also has bursitis. I have several other issues (abdominal 6 abdominal surgeries in 5 yrs, intestinal and more)... After going to PT for a year and seeing a pain management dr for 4 yrs who has done nothing but pump weight gaining pills into me I finally decided to try yoga.  My PT was ecstatic even though my doctors have said to stop exercising (except light walking).  I have decided I'm way to young to feel this damn old.. so yoga it is!  I am on day 17.. I have to limit some poses since I have lost 50% mobility in my left arm... I can feel a difference.  The hip still hurts but the sciatica is easing.. the left arm is starting to stretch out some.. When I got to day 11 I decided to add day 1 back in.. so two classes.. day 12 and day 2.. day 13 and day 3 ect... I want to thank you Adriene for encouraging your audience to keep at it.. to go at their pace.. you explain it all so well..  so thank you... just one more comment... half moon almost killed me..lol",UghozHNcmgDiNXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-09-23T17:52:34Z,-0.9809704422950745

6000.0,"Thanks for the session.  It has been a while since I have done physical yoga, I have spent a lot of time lately only focusing on targeted Yogic humming exercises and chakra opening exercises and lucid dreaming.  The beginning is going to take a while since I destroyed the ligaments and cartilage in my right ankle about 10 years ago in an accident and I can sit with one foot in front of the other, but my body has only about 10-15 degrees of movement before my ankle wakes up and screams for mercy.  So I just sit where the pain is manageable and don't push too hard.  

I also recently started a job as a Dishwasher at a major restaurant chain and it is lots of heavy lifting, hot steam and long hours, so my body is in pain everywhere when I get done.  This is a good way to cool down after a shit.  I am noticing that my body has a lot of stored up pain in it from a dislocated hip in soccer practice 20 years ago, I was lucky enough to hit by cars a couple of times while riding electric mopeds in China plus some street fights (12 on 1 the Chinese way) and other accidents while living there, and I am just not in fighting shape any more.  So, it is good that this is light and easy, focusing on the breathing and targeting attention as much if not more than the body postures, since those are very loose interpretations based on personal need.  My body and my mind need this, my heart is urging me to cry myself to sleep as we speak, so it was a good release.  

It has just been a hard and long life with much more violence in it than I care to describe.  We will see how the body and mind and soul feel after your 30 Day Challenge, I have a feeling it will be on a road to recovery and more spiritual openness (some good disciplined activity as opposed to all the mushrooms I have eaten in the last couple of years to break the mind out of its cage and set my adventure on a new course.)

I was wondering if at the end of your videos, if you could extend the time you play music at the end of the video during final resting pose?  The way youtube works now is that it loads a new video right away automatically after the last video ends.  That means instead of being able to relax in savasana, my mind is drawn to hearing the next video.  Getting up to pause this also interrupts my savasana.

I'm a 24 year old epileptic & I'm currently on the road to brain surgery (still going through all the proper presurgery testing and procedures) I'm on thousands of mg of brain & sleep medication. By this point I'm 5'3 and reached about 200lb, gained about 15 lb in the last couple months from whatever my stress habits have been.
Last week I decided instead of mourning and pitying myself, I would take hold of my life & make a change. 
I've been reading and researching and being careful what I eat, & now I'm taking this challenge. If all goes well I intend to do your yoga camp next if all goes well.

Do you have any suggestions on where to get a yoga mat for a lower price? I'm unable to work so I'm trying to find options",UgjuSBZFNDuSl3gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-08-11T20:48:05Z,-0.9969363212585449

Unfortunately in this video the slow, easy work goes off the rails a little over midway. She starts quickly doing poses that are difficult with no real alternative for beginners without as much flexibility. (Planking, runner's pose). It got too fast and difficult to do. I gave up with ten minutes left. Very frustrating since it's just day one. 

I had watched her introduction to yoga video and enjoyed it. I was excited to see she was in Austin since I live here too. If the first day in the 30 day lessons is this difficult I don't think I'll last a week.

But this was wonderful, thank you, very mindful and really felt great doing it with you. I'm thankful that you've shared this with us, and that there's no hidden fees.. because I guess yoga is a lifestyle but it's very costly to go join classes.. and many times at home you just can't get into it.

The position feels wrong, and hurts both my ankle and me knees. I have very large feet, thick thighs and calfs. I just don't think there is a way for me to do this.

I've done martial arts for years but am new to yoga.  So I'm not inflexible, but this pose doesn't seem to work for someone built like me. Does anyone have any advice or adjustments?

6451.0,"Thanks to you I just started yoga two weeks ago and did your complete beginner session every morning for the first week and the 40 min beginner session for the second week (sometimes even doing the complete beginner one in the evening too since it's so relaxing). 
Now I started 30 days of yoga today and I'm already excited for all the other sessions with you!
You make it so much fun and doing it at home makes it so much easier for me since my work schedule doesn't really allow for me to go to a class.
I originally started it to work a little at my flexibility and it already helps! It's not like I can suddenly put my foot behind my head or something, but I feel that my muscles now ease into some of the stretches when at first it seemed like they couldn't stretch at all. Thank you so much for that!
But even more important: I found this practice to be so incredibly relaxing! Doing this in the morning always helps me to find a positive outlook on the day ahead of me even when I know that there is stuff waiting for me that won't be fun to do. 
(And it also helps in the stressful time of wedding preaprations @.@)

So anyway, what I wanted to say: Thank you so much for being such an awesome instructor and for sharing your wisdom and your passion with all of us.

I found yours top of the search for Yoga and am starting with this 30 day series which I'm loving so far. 4 practices so far this week & I've linked 2 friends with this workout series too as they are both new to Yoga.

woke up and had breakfast and tea then went in.
Doing this to help anxiety and to see if it helps with me feeling generally unwell all of thetime, and if it helps my weight then fab!
First time i've tried yoga
I'm a skeptical person who doesn't believe in the transfer of energy n all that so idk if that will make this harder for me but I dont think that it made a difference for this particular half hour :)
I found it hard to breathe calmly during the harder parts, but I'm sure as they become more comfortable I can get more into it. Best parts for me are the more still positions because then I can gather myself again after not being able to do a plank hahaha
Some of the positions are kinda hard, but defo everyone can give this a go, i was able to do it all, not that I could hold it for even half as long as Adriene, but it you can do it all on day 1 then why try! it's nice to know where you are and being able to see yourself develop. I really enjoyed this. Feel more calm now :)
Gonnae try day 2 tomorrow! :)

I den äldre vediska litteraturen är yoga en term med skiftande betydelse. I senare indisk litteratur är yoga en av hinduismens sex ortodoxa filosofiska system, nära knutet till samkhya, där yoga är inriktat på ett pragmatiskt träningssystem.

Today is the first time I've done a full practice in nearly a year. I've been so scared to get back into it, knowing that I couldn't do what I had done when I was practicing regularly. Knowing that I would basically be a beginner again. I felt so embarrassed and foolish. But I just brought that to the mat today and laid it down. I'm ready to begin again, however slowly.

7303.0,"Honestly, my condition atm is far beyond bad. I'm absolutely not flexible and some of these poses were just too hard for me. Yet I will take this challenge differently: I will keep up doing this first video (Day 1) for a few times until continueing. I noticed already that it's working on all my muscles, making them more loosen. The way Adriene did this video was really calming and a good experience. I especially loved the end pose, just lay freely on the ground and give over to everything.

Hope to get more flexible after a few weeks and get through the whole challenge!",UgilscnNh-CP6ngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-08-15T09:51:14Z,0.9957237243652344

You make a lot of moves in one minute and its hard to keep up when you don't say a lot of things you do like closing eyes, bending or whatever, imagine how comfortable you would be if you had to watch on TV all the moves while doing them.

It may seem to work for some, but does not really indicate that it is based on truth?  Read or research the book ""The Death of a Guru""  by Ravi Maharaj. He was a Trinidadian Hindu who achieved cosmic consciousness.  

One day Jesus manifested to him and told him that those Hindu gods that he worshipped were not real.  Yoga is not the way to the real God of the Universe (Genesis 1: 1).

7498.0,"What is the best time to do a yoga workout? In the morning before breakfast (after wake up) or after breakfast (at least 1 hour after) or in the evening or it doesn't matter? I did every second day HIIT in the morning before breakfast after waking up and now I worry about my back if I exercise after waking up. I think that it isn't good for them because I feel that. I exercise a lot and with HIIT or Tabata I have absolutely no energy. Maybe I am loosing some fat but I am not felling good... I want to switch all my weight trainings (or 90 % of it) and insane HIIT cardio to yoga. Does yoga also need proteins after workout?

First of all.. Thanks so much for the amazing yoga videos. I used to do yoga but I sort of lost track of my inner yogi for a while and your enthusiasm for me right back on track :))
I have a request. My kidneys are not all that and from time to time they hurt. I used to do a yoga session which relieved kidney pain.. I think it stimulates the nerve tracks (is that proper English?) from the kidney throughout the body. There was a lot of leg stretching involved. 
But unfortunately this was a while ago and I can't really recall the 'flow'. 
Do you know anything about this? And would it be possible to do a 'health boost' sequence? I would dig it :)
It worked wonders!

Started doing muay thai kickboxing and gracie jiu jitsu. Then proceeded to do taekwondo, Korean swordsmanship, mma, Tai chi, Qi gong, baji quan, wing chun and various other types of kung fu and close quarter combat including grappling.  Ive picked up many skills along the way over these last 6 years mostly in the last year and a half because I met this daoist monk who taught me the most valuable techniques that I have learned.  Now to get straight to the point: You are incredible.. After doing the first 6 days so far I have learned many new things. I like how it works well before doing my qigong 9 basic motions and my stretch routine.  It helps me get a deeper stretch then I was just with my techniques alone and has expanded my routine that I do before I assist in teaching martial arts classes.  Ive watched other videos and you are far better at the details and much more fit because of it.  It is amazing the way you move so comfortably around.",Ugi-m-IwSQhOyngCoAEC,1.0,0.0,2015-03-26T20:09:46Z,0.9939470291137695

I may have to do day one of the challenge several times before my body is ready to move onto day 2. But I wanted to give you a big thank you!

It was incredible; I've had the intention of starting daily/regular yoga practice for so long because I love being active and taking care of my body but I never take enough time to slow down for some true TLC like stretching and slow dedicated deep breathing etc. So of course per the usual I'm just perusing around to find a good video to try and I see this one. We share a name so it immediately caught my eye, and that it's a series is exciting because it's pseudo-built-in commitment; after finishing I feel so good, I cried, I prayed, I set intentions for myself. I love your aura and attitude throughout the session. It's very very inviting, non-threatening, and encouraging.

I was so busy the whole time trying to make sure I was doing everything correctly, and I know that's not how this is supposed to work. I did everything on the floor, I need to get myself a mat... or maybe doing it on a carpeted floor is better?

8276.0,Today I wrote a blog on my natural healing page for facebook (Alkalize - Detoxify - Regenerate Your Body!) about creating elevation habits.  I set the intention for myself to create a daily yoga routine along with meditation.  I finished my blog which stated I would be doing yoga for the next 30 days.  I closed facebook and had a page open from somewhere.  This video was on the page.  Synchronicity and the power of intention blows me away every time.  Thanks for putting this together.  I shared your series on my blog.  <3 ~Debs  ﻿,Ugiq8Sii41qpdHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-01-28T17:14:16Z,-0.9356657266616821

I cought my brain on saying ""again.. and again"" and feeling more and more weird during the class.. Maybe it's just me, but I like to totally focus on what is actually going on with me while I'm doing yoga and not visualise energies and all the mystic stuff.

8671.0,"Hi Adriene!

I started this challenge with you all today! *hides face* I hope that's allowed and alright! :D

One question: I have tried most of these poses before and I wouldn't call myself a beginner. But, the boat pose has caused some soreness in my tail bone area earlier as well. This time, I followed your instructions and didn't dive into the whole pose altogether. But that seating position causes some discomfort in the lower back area... is it normal? Does it happen in the beginning of this pose...? 

Great work & God bless!

Is it it possible that during the session I felt I was more flexible and perhaps my imagination but the plank got easier even though I should've been more tired? I have only tried Yoga once before at a gym, but being a beginner I felt it went too quickly and so I was not controlled enough to work the muscles properly or improve balance. This was perfect (and the presentation is funny and relaxing, perfect for doing at home :)  ) ",UghbweaPCNFZ7HgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-01-03T19:38:27Z,-0.9152410626411438

I am big fan of yours and been following you since long now! 
I loved all your yoga sessions! 
I volunteer for Art of Living organization of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar if at all you know and I have been teaching people how to relax and get rid of stress through meditation and breathing techniques. Well, I had major accident 1 year back and was advised not to exercise so i stopped gyming! but I still continued with yoga, and meditation. 
Well, my question is that i have back pain should i still do the yoga? becoz my physiotherapist said i should be doing any exercise which gives pain. Do you any suggestions for strengthening back? I have Slip disc problem( L5 ).
If yes please let me know! 
And you are doing an amazing job! ",UggVDVqIag_OU3gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-01-03T13:31:13Z,0.9971645474433899

I wish you would talk more about when it's important to keep your back straight and when it's more important to just do the stretch without worrying about your back. All in all....this did not feel like a beginner friendly video. You really didn't explain enough of the basics. ",UggBpnJ1_5E1zngCoAEC,3.0,0.0,2015-01-03T12:03:44Z,-0.9958570599555969

I'm a little on the heavier side and when I try to do runners lunge - whether my knee is up or on the mat - my finger tips don't touch the ground, which usually makes me hunch and strain.
