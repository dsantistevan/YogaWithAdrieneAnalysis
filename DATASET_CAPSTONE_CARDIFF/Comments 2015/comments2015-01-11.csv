248.0,"I absolutely never comment anything usually but I felt like commenting this one. I'm a person who hates exercising, I never found the pleasure or anything while exercising. I always thought people who say ""it feels great, I love exercising !!"" were aliens. Yet I always managed to stay healthy thanks to my nutrition and all the walk I do everyday to go to school and do stuff. I can't anymore due to coronavirus quarantine, so I thought yoga would be the perfect way to exercise and stretch without actually feeling the pain of exercising. Well, I eventually did (abs day killed me), but I also felt a lot of pleasure (first time in my life !!) and it massively helped the aches of my sore muscle who stay sit all day. I don't thoroughly follow the challenge ; I don't pressure myself, and I just start the next video whenever I feel like I need it and when it would feel good. I don't pressure myself, I can go 2 or 3 days without doing a challenge video. However, today felt incredible ! I also played a video yesterday, and today I automatically went to the mat, and when the video was over, I thought for the first time ""already ???"". I also surprised myself in this video about how steady and balanced I can stay during practice, me who hates exercising and is so stiff usually. Today, for the first time, I was able to follow the video without watching it all the time (English is not my native language, so it's even more difficult to follow for me since I dont immediately get the oral instructions while I practice). It felt amazing. Thank you so, so much Adriene for these amazing videos. Not only they help my body staying healthy during quarantine, but I also find a little pleasure exercising (which is a miracle !!) and it boosts my self-esteem since I always thought I would always be a good-for-nothing when it comes to exercising.

371.0,"Day 11 ‚úîÔ∏è Hi friends! I started today's practice by reading the comments to motivate myself, and I wanted to thank everyone for sharing your experiences üôè I'm starting to feel like I can't describe the changes I feel as I continue doing the practice. There's probably so much happening at a micro level inside my body; it's beginning to heal, drain (the lymphatic system), and balance all of the molecules (cholesterol, testosterone, hormones, etc.) from energy and movement. The last couple of days were really tough for me for different reasons, but today seems like I'm heading out of the woods to some light. I really appreciate the ""Don't Give Up"" shirt today teacher, as it reminded me that  most breakthroughs and changes are about to happen when things become super difficult and I want to quit. It really helped me to think of all these negative thoughts and physical sickness as toxicity purging itself through myself, and allowed me to embrace the suck...since the suck is what makes the victory feel so amazing.

402.0,"So here I am on day 11.... I have been practicing now for about 5 weeks, before the 30 day challenge I did the beginners videos.  I'm almost 50 and have been suffering with serious pain in my hips and hamstrings for about 2 years which resulted in difficulties walking up stairs and hills, and I couldn't even put my socks on without pain.  I had pain medication and physiotherapy but neither had much impact on my pain levels.  I was beginning to despair about what was going to happen as the pain was just getting worse and worse, waking me up at night and seriously impacting on my quality of life.


I did Adriene's Hamstring video and at the end, she said something that I will never forget.... Give It Time.  Tight hamstrings take a while to loosen and become more flexible.  But even after just 5 weeks I have noticed the following benefits:


I can turn to look over my shoulder now without pain... I can put my socks on while standing (believe me, this is a HUGE deal to me, as both pain and balance have improved), my clothes are a little looser, I'm making better decisions about food (even though weight loss was not a goal when starting this), the breathing helps me stay calmer in my everyday life, I'm drinking more water, I'm sleeping way better, my skin and even my hair looks improved, and even though my hamstrings are still tight I've noticed a VAST improvement in the pain levels and I haven't taken any pain medication for about 3 weeks now!


Every part of my body from my fingertips to my toes has shown an improvement in muscle tone and I definitely have more energy and tire less easily.  Psychologically too, I just feel younger and more excited about life and my future than I have in a long time.  All this in only 5 weeks!


So if you're humming and ha-ing about doing this video, hang in there and know it gets better and better.   (I started really noticing the benefits after a fortnight of daily practice).  Adriene is a daily ray of light coming into my life every morning and I will be forever grateful to her for bringing the gift of yoga to the world... for free. 



Love and light to all and I wish you all the very best on your yoga journey.  Namaste!!",UgxVFwdEqlYWQp0_IcZ4AaABAg,0.0,49.0,2019-08-16T09:14:44Z,0.9889732003211975

785.0,"Dear Adriene, I just wanted to share with you what your practice has done for me. I have chronic pain after an accident in my back, head and neck. I also suffer from mental fatigue. I started doing your 30-day challenge with my brother, who is a professional soccer player, and we both began to experience the benefits of yoga. I notice how I can prevent my pain by making sure I practice daily, and how I have become stronger and calmer. My brother notices how he is more flexible and agile on the field. 

Thanks to your challenges I have started practicing regularly and will begin an instructor course this weekend. I want to make yoga an integral part of my life so that I can deal with my pain and fatigue and just improve my quality of life in general. You have truly led me on a healthier path and I am so thankful. Thank you for sharing this with us, and for being so gentle and caring!

911.0,"Hi, I love the 30 days series, and this one has some real challenges in it which kept me on my toes. But I find the goddess pose a bit strange. I've noticed before that you sometimes speed up the breath moving from doing a pose on the left to doing it in the right. But here the breathing seems to speed up suddenly in the goddess pose with no explanation. I try to keep my breathing even throughout my yoga practice (partly due to a heart arrhythmia) so this grated with me. If it is intended to be energising then it would kinda be useful to know in advance.",Ugj_MPOESNYKcngCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-11-14T20:00:28Z,-0.998134195804596

1037.0,"hello!! i am loving this series so far i just have a really quick question (i'm bad at explaining things tho so it'll probably be long)!! there are some poses that i'm not quite there with yet, which is understandable as it's been 11 days, for example i have a hard time keeping my back straight when my legs are also straight, but what am i better off doing in order to reach those poses? for example in halfway lift, am i better off bending my knees and having a flat back at a 90 degree angle and then eventually being able to do it with less of a bend in the knees, or am i better off keeping my legs straight and back straight but be quite a way off having it at a 90 degree angle? or does it not matter as long as i find what feels good? (this may have made no sense i hope someone understands what i'm trying to say haha)

1047.0,"Hey, Adriene! I know you get a billion comments, but I just have to say how thankful I am to have found your videos! I have Cystic Fibrosis, a genetic lung condition. With CF, your lungs get filled with mucus and you can't clear them like normal and it results in numerous hospitalizations and lung damage. It also causes you to cough a ton. With CF, you can cough so hard that you pull muscles, dislocate ribs, pass out, etc. Well, for the last 2-3 years, my back has slowly been getting worse. I have scoliosis and the coughing and pulling muscles has just made it horrible. My prescribed muscle relaxers and I really don't like taking things like that. Tons of people told me to try yoga, so I ordered a Mat and browsed a billion videos and practices trying to find the perfect one. Yours just spoke to me. It wasn't intimidating and made me want to start. I'm about to do this video (Day 11) of the challenge, and just from doing the beginner courses and this 30 Day Challenge, my back has been almost completely pain free! Not only that, but focusing on the breathing helps my lungs a ton. It's also amazing how flexible/strong I've gotten in such a short amount of time. So, thanks so much, Adriene!
