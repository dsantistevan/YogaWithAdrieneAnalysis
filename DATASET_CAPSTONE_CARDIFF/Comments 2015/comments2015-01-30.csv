I guess I just felt glad that I can take care of myself in little ways.

4415.0,"Adriene...allow me to first thank you for doing what you do! I am a stay-at-home Dad, and I homeschool our daughter (15) and son (13). At the start of each school day, we have a yoga session, followed by our meditative practice, and then journalling, before we even begin any of our ""required"" studies. We actually alternate between a ""flow style"" yoga and Yin yoga...so, it took us 10 weeks to complete your 30 Day Challenge, which we just finished today! Now on to ""Yoga Camp"".
On a more personal note, I suffered a severe spinal injury when I was 30 years old...almost 8 years ago. I was initially  paralyzed from the waist down due to a rare complication called Cauda Equina Syndrome. I suffered through 7 years of various surgeries, procedures, physical therapy, pain management, and loads of narcotics. A few months ago, I decided to take responsibility for my own well-being, and made many changes to my life. The first step was stopping the pain meds...those 30+ days were an absolute nightmare! I started walking every morning...I know get up at 4am and walk 6 miles each and every day. But...I must say, that aside from my Dharma practice and meditative practice, yoga really saved my life! 
My ""little"" sister, who is now 25, has practiced yoga since high school, and she recommended your videos to me....I was immediately hooked by your warmth and kind spirit, and the rest is history! 
So...keep doing what you're doing...you may not realize it, or think about it often, but you are changing lives!
Namaste...

Occasionally I would look down at the video and you were doing the same thing as me; which totally encouraged me to keep going.  I set out on this challenge to help my insomnia and to loosen my back a little. I was in a bad car accident 10 years ago and have suffered from back pain every day since. I have tried physiotherapy, massages, you name it and I never even considered Yoga. Well, I have slept like a baby the past 30 nights and for the first time in 10 years my back hasn't hurt once during this journey. Thank you so much Adriene and the community for this challenge. I feel so much stronger as a person and in my body.  I can touch my toes for the first time ever and I can actually savour the moment rather than rushing through life.  I have looked forward to getting on my mat each and every day and time seems to stop when I'm on it. I shall be doing this challenge for another 30 days so I can fine tune my technique then I'll venture off on my own and see how I do.  Congratulations to everyone who made it this far!!

Day 30 - Journey complete.  Since Day 1 I had looked forward to this moment, but now I don't wanna go.  Every single day for 30 days straight I came back to this series.  Reading people's comments, seeing how others felt so far, being part of a wholesome online community.  And now it's done.  This video was a perfect passing of the baton of trust.  Adriene allowing us to have complete freedom, to implement anything and everything we've learned so far and to make this video unique to each and every one of us.  Despite never really talking with people in the comments section, I do hope passersby have seen my day by day commentary in hope to feel some form of motivation, connection and relation to keep pulling through.  I hope passersby will read this in days, weeks, months or years to come.  I hope passersby ensure that the end of this journey does not mean the end of Yoga!  I'm going to miss the 'new challenge' aura of this playlist and how this series helped me look forward to something everyday, especially during lockdown.  I hope Adriene reads this.

I was searching the internet for different ways to control what you allow in your head.. and I read a comment from someone who said ""you need to try 30 days with Adrienne, it's life changing"". That was one of the best decisions I have ever made was coming here to your page. You taught me to control my breath... and with that, I realized you can control what goes on inside. You taught me that I don't come here on my mat to compare myself with others, but to be here now and to be present and to listen to my OWN body. This last day was so fitting... but, even if I had it on mute with my own music playing, I still heard you say ""plant your foot, who cares if you can't do it be wherever you are, be weird, and (my favorite one) smile!"".

Before I found ""Yoga with Adriene"" I used to try a few poses, feel like a failure and give up. This time I ""did"". And the only reason I did is that you made me enthusiastic.

I am more flexible, stonger, have better balance and so much less bodily pain that one month ago. I'm more aware of what I eat too, much more mindful, and have lost 5 pounds without dieting.

5661.0,"Dear Adriene, yoga gave me so much. And for everyone out there starting out, I just wanna tell you all the benefits of yoga I've experienced in just 26 days (I started 30daysofyoga 4 days late):

1) My health has improved so much in all ways. No more headaches, no more pain in my stomach or anywhere in the body. No more back pain. No more weakness and exhaustion.
2) I feel more positive. On some days, yoga has been the highlight of my day and just the best part of it. It saved me.
3) I've learned how to forgive myself. I don't feel so negative about myself or my body and I don't punish myself whenever I eat something I like. I found time for ME.
4) It has helped me to lose weight. I don't have weight problems but my skin looks prettier and my body just looks better and more firmed.
5) My posture! My shoulders are relaxed almost all the time and my posture is wonderful, and my moves.
6) I do not stress as much. During the exams, that was what I needed - something to keep my mind off of studying but to help me improve my focus as well.
7) I sleep better, I eat better, I do things for myself that help me grow as a person.

I felt inspired when I saw someone else said doesn't matter how long it takes you to finish one video. It doesn't even matter if you finish the 30 day challenge within 30 days. So I just want to say that it stopped mattering to me and I continued and now I feel so much better than a year ago.

I looked for a more dynamic form of meditation for my general physical and mental health but also to combat my anxiety. These videos have taught me so much - takng things one step at a time, enjoying gradual improvement, finding strenght in doing things with ease and with fun. I feel better today than I did thirty days ago and my feeling of well-being has been more constant. I did not cry when the clip ended, but I do a little while writing this. You have been one of my first ''friends"" since I have decided to accept, acknowledge, and challenge my mental health issue. I know that a sensitive and sensual person like you must also have her down-days, but despite those days and despite the insecurity that is inherent to the human condition, you got up, and made these videos.

2939.0,"Dear Adriene,
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for being such a lovely guide in my self-discovery journey!
I wanted to practice yoga many years ago but i always stumbled in the preconception that ""yoga is super serious"" and ""you must practice it in a holy room, supervised by a guru of some sorts"" or ""you must give your first born child to it""...silly stuff like that. But then I found your lovely self on youtube and you had me at ""Welcome to yoga with Adriene I'm Adriene"" and the relatable-ness(is that a word?) of your humor combined with your kind and considerate guiding made me approach this with much more ease and I even ended up doing some sessions by my self in parks. Not. Weird. At. All. I kind of enjoyed thinking that maybe people that see me doing that in a public space might consider starting to practice it themselves as well(at least at home). Now I have more confidence and a sweet reassuring in the back of my mind saying that ""the better it gets, the better it gets"". 
Thank you very much, again, for being an inspiration and a gentle, but firm, guide for us all!

It was more intense than a few previous days, but I enjoyed the smooth flow.

2377.0,"Dear Adriene, I completed this in 40 days instead of 30 because of the many time I felt sick out of burnout and fatigue. My perfectionist self was initially so angry at myself for not completing this on time. But then I realized that perhaps, it was meant to be for me to complete it in 40 days since where I live, there's this cultural belief that it takes 40 days for a dying soul to depart and it takes 40 days for a newborn to receive their soul.  And in a way that's how I felt at the end of this video - like that part of me who just couldn't let loose has departed and I have this new soul that's ready to be more attuned to how I feel. 


Today, I only followed you in the beginning and the rest of the way I closed my eyes and basically had a conversation with myself. The entire video, my mind was saying things like ""ooh, let's do a tree pose"" or ""okay, I feel like doing a vinyasa"" and my body responded. I was smiling the whole way through and in my mind, it was just like ""see, told you this would be fun, told you that you're strong enough to hold this teaser"" and things like that. I never imagined that I could listen to myself that well. It's still a work in progress to completely accept myself and tune in to that voice inside, but hey, that's what a newborn does right? It grows. Thank you for guiding me to unlock this light in me, Adriene. You are a blessing. Namaste!",Ugww4i-uHNwY_9bwvrh4AaABAg,0.0,3.0,2019-04-25T13:29:54Z,0.9966061115264893

Got obseeeeeessed! It was truly a revelation.
My everything feels better and for the first time I found that high people speak of in physical activity, but better yet yoga got my mind to function better as well. It's a blessing. Now, my feet almost touch the mat in downward dog, my tree doesn't collapse anymore (and it feels great) but the surprise was me, the weakest person ever, I did the crow for about two seconds when I got shocked, started laughing and fell. 
Today I was scared to be left unguided like, what was I gonna do? I did so much the video ended and I still felt like more so I did more. It felt great. 
I found joy and I found myself - or I'm better equipped to see who I am. Thank you Adriene and whoever else who mworks with you. You may have saved my life.

Like many people here, I have found solace by doing yoga and watching Adrienne's videos and to my surprise, I have found a way to stop being so hard on myself - something I've never been able to do before. I've made it through the 30 days and looking back, I have improved a lot compared to day 1.
True, I haven't been able to do my practice in the perfect and graceful way Adrienne does it. I have stopped in the middle of 1 or 2 videos because I was too tired/depressed/ frustrated because I couldn't do it... Maybe I have even cried a little sometimes... But in the end, looking back, I can say that I have improved, and most of all, I don't feel bad for not being perfect.

The beginning of this challenge was enjoyable, but admittedly difficult for me. However, the more I continued, the better I felt every time I hopped on the mat. As the 30 days progressed, I felt stronger and a bit more confident in myself. 


This last day was emotional for me, as it is hard for me to finish something so rewarding as this challenge. It's also difficult for me to own the power I feel after these thirty days. However, I'll push those anxieties to the side as I thank you Adriene; thank you for such a wonderful habit that I will certainly incorporate into my daily life and even take with me to my first year of college this upcoming semester. Yoga has helped me with my college anxieties and I feel calmer, knowing that I'll be bringing something familiar with me on this new journey in my life.

My back and neck are feeling much better, and I am generally just feeling much better in both a physical and mental sense. It would be a shame to just stop after these 30 days though, so I intend to start into TRUE next and keep up the daily yoga.

3444.0,"I think this challenge is more than a challenge; its a chance to go deeper, take care of your body, give thanks and respect to your body, make your everyday a little less anxious - stressed and fleeting. Its a chance to ""find what feels good"" and maybe complete a mission. My mission was to not get lost in time or myself. I have not only reached my goal in staying grownded but gotten so much more. For one, I wake up every morning noticing and looking for sensations in my body that I previously never noticed. The challenge can get repetative, but bear with it for it is so that you can look beyond the move. Do not hesitate in improvising as that is what this is all about. Look at the last day for example. A delightful toping on an already sweet 30 day practice. If nothing else Adriene makes this more than just a challenge with her synpathetic, easy going, humoristic personality. She includes all, speaks to you with a sense of familiarity and warmth as well as she is dang'on funny.

I had no idea how physically challenging some of it would be and how much more core strength I have now. Going to the gym and lifting weights is so much easier than Yoga!

I look better, feel better (physically and mentally) and I enjoy doing Yoga 5 days a week now. You're a really motivating teacher and I love your style of just doing what you can, trying harder next time and never seeing anything as a fail. 'If you fall, we will catch you'.

Thank You so much from the bottom of my heart... You're a very good human being and you're making world a better place...keep it up girl! We all love you. God bless you!  

For me right now my life was so bad and I was feeling like a trash without any reason. Because I was missing good things in my life... So I thought about adding 1 good habit at a time... I read Atomic Habits by James clear.. and I knew that if I add 5 good habits at a time and try to stick to them than I'm gonna end up going no where(already experienced this a lot of time)... So first I decided to add only one good habit (yoga) which wasn't easy... But there is guidance from a person Adriene I mean.. and the community and those comments.. these postive vibes were enough to keep me hooked up... Now I did for the 30 days and I'm confident about this one... further more I'll add one more and more and keep going on... I suggest all of you read Atomic Habits If you haven't yet...

Whether one is a beginner or advanced yogi you welcome all of us & provide content that suits various levels --- leaving no one behind.

I lost two jobs that I had for semester break and I had to stay at home with nothing to do. Your videos really help me to stay positive during this crazy time and from day to day, they have become increasingly important to me. Every day they gave me something to look forward to. And I was really suprised how easy it was for me to stick to this routine! So tomorrow, I'll have one day of rest and the day after I'll start with the HOME series.

1870.0,"All 30 days finished in only 31 days! Who else is using Yoga With Adriene to get through the COVID pandemic?


I have wanted to get into yoga for a while, but I never was motivated enough to get started. I fortunately stumbled upon Adriene and this journey and I am so thankful! What a wonderful series this has been, and I look forward to continuing to grow my practice and my poses! I have a lot of room to grow in my hamstrings (one day I will touch my toes in forward fold or get my heels near the ground in down dog) and in other places, and I am so thankful for this community.


Thank you Adriene!


My favorite part of day 30 was, while I was off on my own journey with eyes closed finding what felt good, I would occasionally open my eyes to see that Adriene and I were in the same pose! That was a treat.


This whole journey has been a treat. I look forward to the sequel and our next 30 days!

I've been practicing yoga alone and kindda dropping in and out of classes for the last 4 years, but this was the first time I had this much discipline and my body never felt better.

But most importantly, my mind is so calm, I tend to overthink everything and during this whole month, I just had one tiny panic attack but it was not that bad, and I managed to calm myself down quite quickly ! 
Thank you Adriene for introducing me to yoga, for being here with your smile and your humour and your beautiful calming soul and thank you for catching me when I fell... (I fell hard on my knees during crow pose today, but I just laughed, and my bruise will motivate me to do it again)

I am so inspired and I have a lot of respect for all that you do. I really never, ever post comments on YouTube, but this journey has been so extraordinary for me. Every night, I had something to look out for. I wrote in a little diary all positive things I got to do on that day, and on every single day you are mentioned, for giving such energy and inspiration and most of all being a very good yoga teacher!  ''No yogarobots people, no yogarobots''. I love that you said that, and it is true, the way you taught me important life lessons has come by you being patient, bubbly, persistent and relaxed, upbeat. It made me feel like I could handle a lot more after doing yoga. I can not speak for others, but for me, you are a great great yoga teacher and inspiration.

2354.0,"Holy cow! My yoga sequence ended up lasting for a whole 70 minutes! At one point I caught myself trying to rush a pose but then I heard you say ""return to your breath"" and it worked wonders. I searched my body for places that needed a little extra loving and just let my body move. I managed to find what feels good and even challenged myself to retry some poses that made me lose confidence during this journey, like the flipped dog and the tree pose, and guess what?! Because of my breath and the knowledge that I was free to do whatever I wanted, I held the flipped dog for five full breaths, without panicking. I also managed to keep my foot on my thigh in tree pose because I tried doing what you always tell me - press back with your inner thigh. But maybe the most amazing thing is that I felt so good in savasana that I never wanted to leave the mat.

Your inviting personality and attitude towards this practice is incredible and I am in love with your mannerisms and the free spirit that is so required for yoga! NO ROBOTS, PLEASE! I have learned so much about my body and its capabilities throughout this process, and you have given me confidence to do poses I never knew existed or that felt good! Today, on the final day of the challenge, I thought I would be staring at the video the whole 21 minutes, but I proved myself wrong in only looking up a handful of times to see your calm and smiling face, and I really let my body do what felt necessary. I did not know that was possible. I felt confident and capable, and empowered through movement. I have always wanted to be able to call myself a 'yogi', and I believe that today I can successfully say that I am becoming one. I am going to start going to regular studio classes as I have fallen in LOVE and I think yoga is so important for both physical and mental health. It's such a beautiful way to breathe and dedicate time to our powerful bodies and minds, which I am making myself do more of (I am a very stressed person!).

P.S.
I got used to say NAMASTE at the end of every video, but this time I was doing my warrior pose and suddenly saw the video ended. So... *NAMASTE*",Ugwlg_qw6hwBa8LmSCx4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2017-08-25T06:41:04Z,0.9994210004806519

I started the video in the background, and occasionally looked up for inspiration on what to do next, but before I knew it you were on the floor in shavasana and I was still up in warrior II, making my own sequence! I never thought I'd be able to do that, I've never been a very active person or commited to anything like this before. By the end of the video, when I saw the little heart on the screen, I burst into tears. Thank you, Adriene, two years on and this is still helping people every single day.

My mindfulness has doubled and there's been some amazing effects on my body too; I have lost inches, weight and feel so much stronger and more flexible.

I shall still be following your videos, every day - even if I only do a five minute before bed routine and I shall be doing yoga camp after my vacation!

expected. Life this month turned out to be incredibly stressful, and 
this has helped so much to keep me grounded. Even on the worst days, 
allowing myself the time to just be in the practice has been so healing.

After this day 30 my shoulder pain is no longer is their & i have now increased my bench press back to 235 pounds because now i focus on deep breathing when I lift. This has also taught me how much breathing matters in stretching. I use to just hold position without breathing never getting deeper into the stretch, now I get air to all of my upper body increasing my flexibility, Speed and power on my  lifts   , very very helpful , will continue , thank you.......

4096.0,"My intuition (as well as many yogi friends) have been telling me for years that yoga is what my mind and body needed. I attended a few group classes over the years, but always felt too self-conscious of my beginner status that I was never able to fully connect with my breath or truly opening myself up to learn the poses. A month ago I decided to find an at home practice that would allow me to learn at my own pace and on my own time. I am so grateful that the universe (and youtube) let me to you, Adriene! You are exactly what kind of instructor I felt I needed, someone who is skillful enough to teach me through many levels of yoga, intelligent enough to clearly explain how to achieve the poses correctly, and someone who is friendly and funny enough to allow me to not take myself too seriously as I learn. I cannot thank you enough for your teaching process that allows us to understand our own bodies and learning curves. I am now excited to get back into a group class with my new confidence. 
I have gone through so many different emotions this month, but the most profound has been a deep gratitude for finally finding/ connecting with yoga. Since the first week of the 30 Days of Yoga program, I haven't stopped talking about my new found love for yoga, and about the Yoga with Adriene page/ blog! You have truly inspired me to continue my lifelong yoga journey to connect my mind, body, and soul. I cannot thank you enough, Adriene!

Your guidance really helped me get me through the last stretch there. You did not know it, but you were participating, if indirectly, in an Ebola response effort.

4625.0,"Thank you so much Adriene for bringing your energy and your enthusiasm to the world, in particular through this 30 Days series.  I just completed it and ok, I confess, I cheated a little along the way, I missed some days here and there but I always came back to it.  I'm glad I did.  I suppose you could say it all lead up to my first true Yoga experience.   I loved the idea that you came up with for the 30th day although I was a little apprehensive at first.  I felt like Bambi to be honest, standing for the first time!

I started out with a crossed leg position which is unusual for me since it's uncomfortable but it's what I felt like I should do.  Then I saw you did the same.  As I would do some stretches, you would do the same stretches and I was like ""wow, I'm doing it right!"".  Then I went to Cat-Cow and you moved to all fours, so then I was thinking, ""Yeah, I've got this!"".  Gradually as the video progressed I found I was looking less and less, and then I looked at one point to see we were doing totally different things and I was okay with it.  I was thinking ""Look at me ma! I'm a big boy now!"". :D

Then I started to wind down and prepare for the corpse pose and by this time I was in the zone but I just was suddenly overcome with emotion.  I suppose you could call it a catharsis.  It was sad and happy and moving.  At which point, I look up to see the video drawing to a close.  Such a fitting end to a wonderful journey, so I thank you again for sharing this and helping me to take better care of my body and my mind.

On a whim, I googled ""yoga for beginners"", remembering how cool I thought it might be to be like the pretty, fit yogi girls.  But what I've gotten out of this experience goes so far beyond what I originally sought.  I remember the day you had us repeat the mantra ""Accept, Release, Let Go"" and how empowered I felt just letting the words spill out of my mouth over and over until that zen feeling was all I knew.  I've noticed so much physical progress, but what I'm so much more excited about is how much I've rebuilt the strength, flexibility, and balance of my mind.  I know you don't know me, and maybe it's weird to say, but in these past 30 days you've been my best friend.  And introduced me to a peace I hadn't known was attainable.  I am looking forward to my future for the first time in a long time.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <3",Ugg_tEA7hgoDHngCoAEC,1.0,1.0,2015-10-07T21:52:32Z,0.9990291595458984

4657.0,"Thank you... and thank you. Just finished 30DOY. 

From someone who has struggled with lower back pain for many years, you have been a huge help. I was trying to find some sort of stretching video a couple of months ago and came across one of your videos. After completing the ""Lower Back"" video, I instantly had a little bit of relief. And now after completing 30DOY, I can get out of my car with no hip pain and ride in my car for more than 30 minutes without suffering from ANY back pain. And... I rarely need to take anything for my back anymore. There are of course some ""moves"" that remind me of my less than perfect back and I know I'm not ""cured""... but I genuinely feel so much better and am very appreciative. 

I could have NEVER brought myself to attend a Yoga class... I am a 6'3"" bearded, out of shape and embarrassingly uncoordinated individual who wold have been quite the spectacle at any yoga class. Being able to do this in the pricacy of my own home, along with your guidance... it's hard to image how far I've come in just a couple of months.

4900.0,"Yes, yes, yes, just finished the 30-day challenge, yay !!¬†
So happy and, let's admit it, proud of myself as well :-)
My first intention as I started on May first was to stick to the practice and finish on May 31.
My second intention was to be gentle and loving towards my body no matter what, knowing that as a 2-year complete yoga beginner practicing at home thanks to the YWA channel (thank you so much) the challenge would be very challenging indeed. Because I was so stiff, so non-flexible.
Curiously enough, the love I gave to my body while practicing did not make the challenge that hard because I kept being respectful to where my body was at, having Adriene as a guide and not viewing her as a perfect body I should mirror.
And took me so far, in my practice, in my self-love and in my everyday life, as well. I did not expect so many bonuses.
And I did not realize how empowering the challenge was. For day 30, I originally intended to follow Adriene but though my body found its own dance within and surprised myself doing some moves seen during the challenge.
Thank you so much, I am feeling a bit emotional myself right now. And I cannot wait to continue a daily practice.¬†
This 30-day challenge really allowed me to love my body just the way it is, while I work on making it healthier (thus more beautiful to my eyes) every day.

I started out as a complete beginner but I managed to complete this series without missing a single day. It was the one thing I was looking forward to each day and it never disappointed. I didn't get emotional at the end of this video because I know that it isn't the end of my yoga practice, and that I will be working my way through all of your videos to try and improve myself as best I can.

I've been doing yoga on and off for years, but I did this cause I really wanted to develop a practice. When I saw what you had in store for Day 30 my mind was like ""noooo, I'm not ready for that"" but my body and heart knew what to do.

I must admit I was too nosy to wait until today to hear what the surprise was, and when I found out it was 20 min. of freestyle I freaked out. That self-doubt that is so familiar to me creeped in and said ""I could never do that!"", but almost immediately I became excited to see what I would actually do. That wonder you talk about often set in and I couldn't wait for today! But then, I hopped on my mat and that self-doubt¬†frenemy came to check in again; ""what if I just stand there...?!"" But then I thought.. yeah.. so what if I do?

Well, the jokes on me, because that's exactly what I just did. And it was invigorating. I'll be honest, when you first said that you were going to be taking off your mike, I had a moment of 'how am I going to do this?' but as soon as I got on the mat and the music started to play, it just flowed perfectly. I did the moves that I felt I needed today and we must have had some kind of connection because just as I got into my final, beloved corpse pose, the music ended. This was truly a wonderful way to end the 30 day journey. I now know I can hop on a mat, do what I need, and give myself some time each day for myself. I truly didn't think I would have that by the end of this, I thought I would struggle to stick with the 30 days, let alone wanting to continue on with it for the next 330!

I'm sick right now, so lots of gentle restorative poses happened, but I was surprised at the ways in which I was moved to be more active - downward dog and tree pose made it in to my practice! I think I'm going to try to make this DIY yoga a weekly practice, great for Saturdays!¬†

Now about the whole challenge: breathtakingly great! I've been doing yoga everyday for maybe a year now, as it helps me manage the pain due to my health condition, but this challenge deepened my practice in such marvellous and unexpected ways. You are by far my favourite yoga teacher! Always encouraging me to ""find what feels good"" and listen to my body. No more feeling shame or sadness that my body is not able to be a ""yoga robot"". I don't like doing public classes: they're usually too long for me, too fast-paced, and certainly not catered to my own disabilities. Your teaching style always encourages me to do my own thing and never makes me feel guilty that I'm incapable of a certain pose at a certain time. So much love to you, Adriene!¬†

I just have to say that you're such an inspiration and I really feel inspired to do yoga and generally lift my attitude. I can't do it all yet, but unlike most other instructions, you don't demand the viewer to be able to do ninja handstands on a single finger or something. I love the ""get comfortable"" attitude, which after all is what yoga is all about. Granted some exercises feel strong and demand a lot of pressure but I love your approach.

5616.0,"I'm only at day 17 but I had to peek in ;) I didn't think when I started that I would be able to keep going every day with something that was completely new to me. I tend to always be happy in the beginning when I start practicing something new and then it disappears little interest for each day until it completely dies out. But with yoga it has been completely different. It ¬†have become something that I long for and look forward to every day. I have now noticed how the body changes and becomes stronger, the way my mind becomes calmer of yoga and I become really present.
I can't thank you enough much for the help! You were the first teacher of yoga I meet and after that have I tried a few others, but I always come back to you and your sessions. After this 30 days, I will not be able to stop do yoga. And that's thanks to you and the encouragement you give all the time. I have found something new to fill my life with and I am so incredibly grateful. Lots of love from Sweden! :) Namaste",UghIJnxdCO_GYngCoAEC,0.0,1.0,2015-01-31T16:07:11Z,0.9991382360458374

I will definitely be coming back to all of the videos you have shared over the past 30 days, and perhaps even go back to the beginning and see how much I have developed my practice since the start of this.
Thank you for this and your channel in general. I have been trying to cultivate a good home practice for almost 6 months now and you encourage me to get on the mat most days. This 30 days has only made it better. I cannot thank you enough! Namaste from a grey day in London :D¬†

34.0,DO NOT SHOW PLOW POSES for beginners!!! I slipped rolled on my neck and it took me over $1000 in over 20 chiropractor visits to recover and I still have nagging pains here and there. The reward to risk ratio is not worth it for plow poses. Last yoga with Adrienne video I will  ever watch.

I felt very claustrophibic when doing the poses at 1st, kind of horrified by my lack of range of motion. 15 years of running with very little emphasis on stretching left me VERY inflexible. About 3 weeks in I realized this is what has been missing from my life, just simply relaxing, breathing, and letting my body become used to it's natural form. Adriene, thank you for the GIFT and your willingness to serve others. I feel like a different person, and I can't wait to see what the next 30 days brings!

55.0,"Adriene. I want to thank you so much for all that you do. Your positive vibration is felt even on the other side of the world. For the past month I have been doing lots of meditation in concurrent with your yoga after experiencing the dark night of the soul. Your videos brought the realisation that teaching yoga is my soul's purpose, something I've been looking for an answer my whole life. Today is the first time I cried (ugly cried) doing yoga especially when the first song came on, by TWDY if I'm not mistaken since you're from Texas? Definitely one of my favorites. I even teared up before practice when you said ""namaste"" because you're so sincere and I feel you do see and acknowledge the light within me. For the first time also I flowed naturally as to what my body needs and it feels so good. Thank you so much and I will continue the practice for a lifetime and spread the light to others as well.

I've acomplished many things in these 30 days:  
- My head finally touched the ground in a wide legged forward fold. This was today. I felt so acomplished I had to do it another time. 
- I was able to stand in crow pose!
- My head touched my knees in head-towards-knee pose.
- I've put much more ease and confort in all my poses.
- I've learned to love core-strenghtening poses.
- I feel much more confortable with my knees on the ground in the crescent lunge. 
- I can put my elbows on the ground with my legs open.
- And many other things I can't remember now! My body is flowing with positivity. 

I've been practicing yoga daily for 277 days, but in this last 30 days (really 34, as I practiced by myself or practiced along other videos some days) I feel like I've enjoyed and I've been present in my heart, body and soul the most. 

Thanks for this journey. I send lots of love to anybody who reads my comment, I know it's a lot of text!

The 30 day challenge has been extremely exciting for me, I eagerly waited to learn something new, and I am glad I didn't lose interest when I couldn't do any asana with the same efficiency as Adrien on my screen. I am happy to share that I have improved a lot since day 1. I am sad that this challenge has come to an end.  So, I am looking forward to learn more and more.

188.0,"I don't know how to express what i'm into words. This is the first time, I finished something. I never tried yoga because of two reasons :-
1. It was slow. 
2. Nobody talked much about weight loss, toning up, overall getting a good physique. Instead talked about how wonderfully it impacted their life. 
I knew I had to try yoga since it meant dumping away all my toxic thoughts towards my body. And guess what? I DID IT. I'm far more comfortable in my body than I was before. Yoga and meditation have become a part of me. It keeps me, ME. It stops me from talking ill about my self, even as a joke. It has helped me stick to a few more good habits. And the best part, it never felt like a chore. I want to tell the world how powerful is yoga and meditation. 
Adriene, YOU ARE THE BEST. And I shall always come back to this video when I don't feel like doing guided yoga at some days. I loved how it felt today. It felt so good to have all my internet buddies on the other side of the world doing their own things.

Funny thing, I kept hearing about this challenge for years and every time I peeked at one of the videos I was like 'yeah, nope.' Then, a month ago, for some reason I decided to give it a go and this time something magic happened... I kept coming back everyday, some days I was frustrated, confused, in pain, and yet I just couldn't resist coming back. One day, as we were doing one of those easiest poses, I suddenly felt like a new compartment in my brain opened... I can't explain this but from then on I just knew yoga had become part of me.

Your cheerful spirit makes doing yoga a real bliss, because it's a practice of accepting yourself at where you are in that moment, and finding love and grace in that acceptance.

Thank you for these 30 days too! For the past few months I've been practicing every morning before breakfast and it feels great!
Thank you for your lovely gifts and please don't stop! I love having in my living room every morning!
Much love from Firenze to you, Benji and all the lovely people in this community.

295.0,"A big fat thank you, that was amazing! 

I'm normally the kind of person who follows directions very well, maybe adding a tiny bit of my own, but when given total freedom I don't know where to start, or where to go. Today I decided to try it on my own and I figured that if I got totally lost I'd just check the screen and follow along. I ended up not needing to, which made me feel very good about myself!

I was also more aware of my body, my breath, my alignment, as I did the poses.  With the videos, I often feel like I'm either going too fast or too slow and I am more focused on my pace rather than my body.

So thank you for putting out these 30 days of yoga and other contents. Even though it took me months to go through this first series, it helped me do 30 more sessions than I would have otherwise. I will definitely check out the other series and will probably do a few on my own as well. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",Ugz6pc5CdaNUWWDlJF14AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-04-02T20:24:24Z,0.9978526830673218

517.0,"I‚Äôm 36 years old and have tried get involved in Yoga practices in the past, I don‚Äôt think the time was right for me & I was doing it for the wrong reasons.

I have been generally very fit most of my adult life, but I had a year of inactivity, until I started 30 days of yoga with Adriene on the 1st December. 

The first thing I will point out is that I have always felt like the least flexible person that know,  despite generally being a very fit person, marathons and iron distance triathlons being my favourite activities in my early 30‚Äôs, I have gain more movement in all my body and actually feel taller as I am holding myself in a much better posture! 

I also started running again to go hand in hand with yoga so again I am on day 27! This is where I have noticed the greatness difference as I have been in and out of running throughout my life.

Not one day have I felt overly in pain or too sore / achy, or felt as though I had to force myself to go for a run. It has been effortless, considering I have had a year off, I‚Äôm shocked at the way I feel! 

I feel fantastic and I plan to continue everyday with yoga, my mind is focused and I am full of energy! 

I would love recommendations as what to do next when the 30 days finish?

I would love to work towards a yoga instructor course to hold myself accountable to the practice and lead me to a deeper understanding. So any help or advice would be great. 

I plan to continue practicing daily for the next 6 months and look at doing something then, so again any tips or recommendations would be most welcome. 

I just want to say thank you Adriene, 

You have a beautiful and delicate effortless flow, to the way you teach!

Time flies by when listening and watching whilst learning from you. 

I really appreciate what this has brought to my life. 

I  couldn‚Äôt imagine waking up each day to any other women but you üòÜ

Jokes aside! I cannot thank you enough!

My hip and joint flexibility seems surprisingly good and there were only about three days where I felt achey the next day. Main issues being my balance on one leg, I found the breathing rhythm sometimes difficult and distracting to try to keep to, and I'm tall enough to where I can't bend enough to reach my toes yet nor step from a plank into a lunge without my torso or the floor simply being in the way! It was very interesting to do, and I think I'll rest for a week then perhaps start the 30 days all over again.

660.0,"I started this 30 days series a couple of weeks after quarantine started. I had finally started going regularly to the gym months prior to the pandemic, and started taking yoga classes there. I was devastated when I realized I couldn't continue 'cause I had been enjoying it so much, so I decided to try it online. However, yoga during quarantine proved to be a bigger challenge than I thought. Not being able to go out to practice yoga with other people and to get feedback from the instructor, not having the same routines for eating, sleeping and going to university/work, the increased stress and constant fear that this whole situation put me (and all of us) in. It all seemed to hinder my ability to actually enjoy, relax and concentrate in the practice, and even getting to the mat everyday was a struggle. So, after a week, I stopped. I felt totally defeated, I was so disappointed at myself. 

I've learned and grown so much during this period though. There's been some really tough days, some rough periods, but it's all left me feeling stronger and more determined. A couple of weeks ago I decided to try this challenge again, with a renewed attitude and energy. I am proud to say that yesterday I was able to finish it!!! I wanted to cry of happiness. And a HUGE part of this success is also due to Adriene's positive, warm, motivated attitude. This whole process has left me feeling inspired and excited to continue with this wonderful practice. You are an amazing instructor, Adriene, and I will definitely continue watching and learning along with your videos, even after this whole pandemic situation finally comes to an end!

677.0,"I did 30 days of yoga and I wanna share my thoughts and opinion. I took more than 30 days, like 40/45. Sometimes I skipped from laziness and sometimes 'cause it was the weekend. However i finished all and I'm proud of myself, I feel strong, I feel that I can achieve what I want, my mental health as well as my body's health are improved. I got clarity in my everyday life, I got control over my breath. I know control my body, I used to feel bulky, like an elephant in a jewerly not anymore now and it's crazy how you can improve in just 30 days. If we talk about my appereance, as a man I gain weight over my belly and I definitely see a result there, still something that I have to work on but way more toned and the circumference is decreased for sure (some people even asked me if I lost weight) I see a change on my legs and my butt (my body type is skinny fat). It's October 2020, I took more days than 30, but I still did it and still would do it. I recommend this challenge to everyone, 'cause improved my health in general and now I wanna challenge myself in even more ways.

Next day, I could feel it coming back, do yoga, and then gone. By the end, I could count more pain free days then pain filled. Just wow.

The way you just easily say its ok if you cant do this bit or that bit.. or might collapse, made it easy so I didn't give up.  I religiously followed and tried to understand yoga language, until near the last 10 days... I could just listen to you and follow without looking at the video.  Your personality and the way you teach and talk its amazingly positive, I feel happy and my body is toned not as good as yours, still don't understand how you can touch your head on the floor with your legs apart, that is a target for me to reach, one day.  I will be watching your other videos and follow :)

Thank you from the bottom of my heart Adrienne, for me the challenge was not to stick to an exercise routine even though it's a big part of it; The real challenge for me was to stick to anything, for years i've been living in my head, having dreams and planning for things but never getting anything done and year after year i lost confidence in my ability to make my life better just because i couldn't stick to habits or decisions i made. Having completed this, proud doesn't begin to describe how i feel. I feel so grateful to you, for your inspiring sequences , words and attitude. Just 30 days have made me realise how strong i am mentaly, and how i limit my own self by saying i can't while i can, i've learned to believe in myself again and find courage to just try and see where it goes without feeling stuck on the idea of having or doing it perfectly.

Obviously, the physical changes are great (and as a former dancer, it's nice that I'm beginning to regain a lot of what I lost when I quit). But the mental and spiritual growth I've gotten out of it has really surprised me the most. It's been tough the last few months, but yoga has given me a sense of stability. It's something that, no matter what, I feel like I'm achieving something by doing it. And lastly, it's helped me feel free. I'm reminded every single day that I don't have to be perfect, that just being myself is enough. That even if I fail, that that's still okay.  I'm reminded every day that it's okay to just let go of the things that don't matter. And even if it's just for the 20 or so minutes of the video, I know I can just be present and completely in the current moment. So thank you, Adriene.

I had a few funny moments of looking over and seeing you were doing something similar to what I was doing.  Other times, you did something totally different, and that was okay.  I practiced a few different warrior poses, flowing from one to the next, and it felt great to do my own thing.  That allowed me to focus on my body more and think about what I noticed and what I didn't notice.

 Adriene, thank you sooo much! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I once used to go to yoga classes, but I considered it too boring at that time... But I don't know‚Ä¶ this time it worked. üòä

Maybe I matured and changed my mind about it, and this has been the right time and place. But what I know for sure it has been also about your amazing attitude, pleasant voice, making the poses and transitions not too fast and not too slow either, explanations along and just making me forgive myself that I can't do some poses, for some struggles and to give myself the time to get there. 

Also, this challenge kind of motivated me to go further with myself and my body and I've started to work out to get stronger and lose weight hopefully. Currently going through your foundation videos too, to get into yoga more. And this whole journey gave me some push to think about my procrastination more, about my life in general and just do something about myself but not to hate myself. And it has been a nice and productive way to spend the time during quarantine.

But then I took the leap of faith, freestyled the whole session, just let my body guide me through it, let it get what it needed and damn, that felt good!

First days were ""weird"" as I am definitely not an athletic person and very out of any possible shape and didn't have much strength nor will to go on a mat. But after 30 days, I found that I actually want to be on a mat. I want to do my poses. I want to look at my very unbendable back and go ""I don't care, we're doing it today"". I can't keep a balance pose on my left leg even if I glue myself to the ground and I keep falling. But I keep laughing and start again.

And the funny thing about this video is that I was super sure (like ""no way"") I was going to follow what Adriene was doing on screen. And then after 2 minutes, I just thought ""oh no, I really want to do this"" and started doing my own thing. Weird as I possibly forgot a thousand of poses I wanted to do, but, hey, I'm still laughing about my umpteenth attempt at tree pose on my left leg. So: worth it.

1217.0,"Lockdown was a pain for me. I felt trapped and bored. I try to stick to a daily excerising schedule but i couldn't do one excerise a day. So i decided to do yoga once again. Last year i was in a yoga club it was fun and even before that i did some yoga. When i searched up yoga for beginners i came across adriene. I looked at her 30 days of yoga challenge and thought ""hmm maybe then will help."" Fast forward to day 17. After the practice was done, I felt alive and i suddenly snapped. I knew that I have soon realized the power of the breath. After day 20 i soon felt bored and unpowered. I did the 30 day challenge anyways but i did it really really late. Fast forward to now. I have finished 30 days of yoga. I never really thought i would. Now i feel happy and empowered. I forgot how amazing yoga made me feel but sadly this challenge is over. I decided to start doing more 30 days of yoga challenges with adriene but i will remember what and who helped me get so far. Thank you adriene, you were the best yoga instructor i had and i hope your doing well in quarantine. Even everyone else here.

1241.0,"These last months have been a personal hell. I got burned out in January because of work and life. I‚Äôve had all the obvious stress signs but still kept on going. I‚Äôve been going to a psychologist and I‚Äôve been able to identify some emotional childhood trauma that I couldn‚Äôt proces at that time. That means I‚Äôve got to face and understand that pain and suffering and relearn my emotional, physical and mental habits. Going through that in addition to being burned out and Covid was a really difficult task and actually still is. However, ive been steadily climbing forward to the life I want for myself. Somewhere in March I discovered this channel while researching ways to ground myself, as I am quite anxious. It was a rough start to do every day. First month was a once a week exercise and then slowly it became more regular until day 13 and I started doing it almost every day and alternating/combining with meditation. And here I am, at day 30! I‚Äôm proud to have completed all days and I‚Äôve gained a lot of new insight, knowledge and strength to better take care of my body and mind. I‚Äôll definitely continue on these practices.

I'm in Miami, far from my family back home during this crazy time, but I joined with friends who had found this challenge and wanted to do it remotely during stay-at-home. I started without knowing anything about you and loved how natural and down-to-earth you were from Day One. Your classes just resonated with me. A few days in, my friend mentioned you were in Austin, and then I learned you weren't just in Austin but from Austin, and it all made sense -- I was doing yoga with someone I could have grown up with. (OK, more likely I could have grown up with your parents, but you get the point!) Thank you for being you and for the inspiration and pure joy you share so effortlessly.

 Did not believe I would be able to stick to it every single day but I did, and I am so happy about it. Adrienne's teaching, so relaxed, happy, joking, telling us it is not a big deal if we can't to this or that yet, pushing us to take one more breath in a challenging position etc, was exactly what I needed as a 1000%beginner. I was kind of a skeptical girl about all that fuss around yoga, but you changed my mind completely about that and the approach of the practice, all in decontraction and nothing about performance. Without trying yoga at home with Adrienne, and going to a random yoga class, it would have frozen me and kept me away from it, because, let's be real, I know myself; and not being able to follow a class like the others, and comparing myself constantly to people would have rebucked be after 2 classes at most. 
Now,  I know I can attend a yoga class without all the negative emotions and just let it flow like Adrienne teached us, and for that reason I am really grateful !!
My time on the mat every morning on these 30 days was the best thing that happened to me in that period for real..

1343.0,"Wow. Thank you for this series.
Not going to lie, today I panicked listening to the intro. I can't do my own flow with no guidance! First thought, it's ok I'll follow along with the video, but then when I started that went completely out the window.
I followed my breath, I didn't have that voice in my head thinking 'I hope the instructor gets us to do (insert favourite pose here) today'. I did what I wanted, needed, felt like doing.
Thank you for opening the doors to self guided practice. Learning that I don't have to rely on a teacher to tell me how to do my practice be it in a live class, video, app, has been the best take away for completing these 30 days.
I'll be back for more yoga with Adriene but I'll also be rocking my own thing on the mat.

1356.0,"Adriene I just wanna say thank you for helping me in my recovery discover a side of myself I never knew possible.  10 months ago I started treatment at the B. Riley Sober house in Cleveland, OH (the only lgbt treatment ctr this side of the country for addiction) a complete trainwreck of a human being but I always turned back to your videos to bring me both that inner peace and strength that lay dormant for so long that I knew I needed to fight my addictions and heal as a person from trauma. This is the first 30 day yoga series I've been able to finish in 3 years. Ok so it took me around 45 days to finish this one(lol) but me and my friend Steven both started together and although he relapsed and fell off the wagon a bit,  hes starting to get back on track with his life and said he's doing your sessions on his own now which is awesome. I'm glad the seed was planted. We love your style, your goofy humor, your sassyness! I'm so glad to have you as yet another mentor, guide, teacher on this road of life we're all on. I plan on taking your sessions to the B. Riley Sober house and other treatment centers to get some of the newcomers in recovery exposed to your empowering yoga videos which they so badly need in those early, vulnerable, scary days of treatment. I'm at such a better place now mentally, spiritually,  and physically and you played a huge part in it Adriene and I just wanna say once again, Thank you. I look forward to doing some of your other 30 day challenges In the future i just gotta figure out which one i wanna do next.

1385.0,"this was one of the most empowering moments ever for me. so from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU ü§ç‚ú® this 30 day challenge was really the first time i had tried yoga. i started it when i was in the busiest stage of my degree, final year with everything looming. not only did i complete my degree and have the most stress-free academic period i have EVER had (noticeable to many), i also totally fell in love with yoga. I experience really quite bad panic attacks, and can be an anxious person. For this, i feel like i never really switch off. With yoga, i quickly realised that you truly can switch off - and even if for only 30 minutes, the impact this can have on the rest of your day is monumental. I am very blessed to have such lovely friends in my life, but with yoga i truly became my own best friend. Me, myself and my yoga mat against the world. I know that when i‚Äôm on the mat, i am safe. No matter what is worrying me that day, for those moments that i am on the mat, my mind is still and i am safe. This has been such a fun journey, and i really surprised myself that i was able to create my own flow in this session. I decided to incorporate a 5 minute meditation into my flow, to really reflect on this journey, and it felt amazing. Yoga will be part of my daily practice for a long time now, and i cannot thank you enough Adriene for introducing me the yoga world. In september I will be starting a masters degree in ‚Äòpsychological well-being and mental health‚Äô. The course has a module dedicated to mindfulness and positive psychology, and i believe the lessons learned from yoga will be a huge contribution to this. Thank you so much Adriene, and to the lovely community joining in too - I always loved reading the comments at the end of a session!

The moment Adriene said I don‚Äôt know why I feel so emotional...I just started crying and I cried the whole way through the practice. I cried because it‚Äôs over. I cried because in the middle of this chaos and uncertainty I could always find peace and look forward to unrolling my mat with you Adriene. I cried because every time I looked up at my screen you had this peaceful and calming smile that made me feel everything will be ok. I cried because I‚Äôve never done anything consistently for 30 days and here I was. I cried at what a huge difference I feel in my body and mind and how proud I am of myself. All this crying helped me go even deeper into my poses and feel free. Thank you Adriene. You have no idea how much you‚Äôve helped me and countless others.

I completed 30 days without missing any day, every day scheduled my yoga with sunrise and maintained it for a whole month! I never do any sports regularly, even my favourite ones. Not a gym type of person either, but this totally changed me. It gave me the feeling of discipline and also eagerness to really do it! I started this during the quarantine, its been a long time since Italy started the lockdown nation-wide and I was really depressed and lost before I started. Your guiding not only helped me to feel better about my body but it also changed me completely, made me a happy person and taught me to always smile! I never once been this happy and positive in my life and I cannot stop yoga now since you got me so into it! I'll continue with the other videos/playlists and subscribe to the private ones very soon too because my time spent doing yoga is just the most quality one spent. 
Also congrats everyone who made it so far!

After having a good cry today on mothers day, I decided that I needed to make sure I finished day 30 and I am glad I did. It was so amazing to see how my body just knew what poses it wanted to flow through!

Adrienne is def. the reason for it. I felt encouraged to do this every day but not forced because Adrienne made me feel like it was an optional thing how much i wanted to do as long as i showed up. That really kept me really motivated euch day to do my best in the practice. The result are really great. I feel so much more flexible especially in my hips and hamstrings and gained so much strength in my arms. I can do planks and sideplanks with ease now. Most of the time i look in the mirrow and dont see the flaws of my body anymore. I appreciate and accept my body and kinda love it now. This is the best thing that came out of quarantine. Obviously i will continue my Yoga practice because i love how it changed my days for the better.

1569.0,"Hey Adriene! 
This series of 30 Days of Yoga is 5 years old, but I completed it this year during Quarantine. I got laid off work in late March and I started the 30 days the last week in March. I thought I was not going to be able to finish this series since work was expecting to begin again April 1st. Although this pandemic is still continuing all over the world, I wanted you to know that your 30 days of Yoga has got me through it. There were a couple days where I had skipped, thinking it would be a good idea for a break. WRONG! I was not myself at all, yoga now has been apart of my daily routine in the morning. So I wanted to thank you Adriene, for putting out these videos as you are continuing to do so. The videos you have posted have clearly stood 5 years and i feel as if you posted these a few months ago. Even after the 30 days I have continued to another 30 day challenge, Yoga Camp. Although again it is dated, I feel it will give me years of content that will be so enjoyable to participate in, even in quarantine. 
Thank you for what you do and I hope this brings some joy to wherever you are now. 
Still going strong,

Jane from Canada :)",Ugw-4Bpsv8cUCv4v9R94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-05-04T19:10:00Z,0.9658298492431641

Even though I know nothing's ending, and I'll start another challenge of yours tomorrow, today it still feels a bit bittersweet - maybe because it's a 'whole', and I DID it. I mean, I'm the kind of person who usually starts something just to never finish, but not this time - it's been 33 days since I've started this, and I can say I've become a bit happier every day that we met in the down dog (and you were right, it IS a bloody resting position :DD), not only because I feel more rested and flexible, but also because it proves I am capable of going through with stuff. That has been my intention, and for that and all the kind words of encouragement I say thank you.

Thanks to being stuck at home during this time of Covid-19 I decided to try this.  A random search on YouTube brought me to this 30 day challenge.  The last 30 days have been amazing and although I can' do every pose in the Day 30 video, I was surprised at how well I kept up.  I never could have done that 30 days ago.

1686.0,"Hi Adriene. I just wanted to say a MASSIVE thank you! During the lockdown in Barcelona (day 45 as i type) i decided to commit to this 30 day yoga a couple of weeks of just sitting around. Given that I'm not the best at sticking with things, i did it, my 30th day was today! (I missed two days as i was feeling like i overstretched on on of the days so wanted to make sure i didn't do further damage) but i feel amazing! I've never even be able to get near to touching my toes in my life (I'm 6'3) but now i can! But it's not just the stretching, it's the feeling of accomplishment and the way i am feeling which is just as important, to me anyhow. It proved to me that if i dedicate myself to something, to REALLY commit to something, i can complete it where as before, some negativity would stop me from doing so, convincing myself that i probably wouldn't feel any better anyway. How wrong i was! I feel I'm much more balanced, both physically and mentally, am calmer and more positive but overall, just have a great feeling of well-being.I've always being a grateful, grounded person who is thankful for even the smallest things, but these last 30 days during this lockdown phase has put further emphasis on that. I will be continuing with yoga for ever now, making sure i commit to it every day. Before i used to think it would take an hour or two to do and i would then think i would never have the time to do it, but your classes prove, just 20-30 minutes a day is all you need and I've learned so much over the last few days about my body as well as mind. So thank you for literally changing my life for the better. Namaste.",UgxraNXd0BNv1pvEowV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-27T16:46:54Z,0.9881079792976379

1723.0,"First off, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this series. I just completed the 30 day challenge and I confess this is my first ever 30 day challenge that I have completed. You have made the practice of yoga playful, fun and enjoyable. Of all the years of practice I have on the mat ( i have been an on and off practitioner) this is the first time I have the confidence of continuing my home practice without help from a video. You have instilled that confidence by reminding us constantly not to be a yoga robot. I have loved practicing every day and I will continue my practice going forward. You are the best thing thats happened to my yoga practice this lockdown. Forever grateful!",Ugz_sVuKmTwevvhtTkh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-25T06:40:29Z,0.9997618794441223

And in the silent Day 30, you were a joy to watch - like a dance. (I did do some yoga as well!) I am not new to yoga, having practiced on and off over the years, but I've never had a regular daily practice. I'm nearly 73 and I feel ""softer' and stronger and somewhat invigorated after the daily 30 day practice.  :)  thank you, namaste",Ugw27UzkkdGReXqjOSV4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-04-25T01:27:35Z,0.9998149275779724
1726.0,"I lift weights. I have been for a long time. It is my honest belief it has made me a better person in general, not only on the outside. With that said, with the current state of the world, I decided to try something newsince gyms are closed and I am limited. A blessing it seems. 31 days ago I would have laughed if someone suggested yoga to me. Now, after 30 days of religiously doing it, I feel healthier than ever. I let go of so much discomfort and pain it is downright insane. I sleep better, I feel more rested, I am comfortable. Amazing.

I plan on starting another one of your 30 days, or doing them all! That said, I missed your voice today. 

Anyways, there is a lot more I want to say, since thanks doesn't cut it. Still thank you sincerely for improving my life more than I ever thought possible. And I will see you on the mat tomorrow.

It kept me grounded and sane, and directed my anxiety to become more positive energy.  It kept a goal and a sense of purpose and focus in my mind.  Thirty days later, I do feel stronger and grateful for the time I got to spend with my body. I did get to know it better.  I know I will continue to do so after these 30 days too.

Thank you for bringing me up during this quarantine. I haven't done anything related to sports since last summer and now I did 30 days straight with no effort but with joy. I have my personal wins such as 1st pushups ever in my life - and now I really do them! Plus I have pain in my wrists for last 4 years, especially in left one (violinist's problems). Basically I try not to push on my wrists ever. Well, today I did my first crow in 4 years. Plus pushups, plus even cat-cow - i was really afraid in the beginning but then in process, being as mindful as I can, i feel so so so much better now! 
Thank you dear Adrienne, hope you're doing good now and your family is safe.

When you said that you wouldn't be guiding us through this practice I felt a bit apprehensive, but once the music kicked it I felt so empowered and I just went for it. A few times I looked up at the video and I was even in the same position as you! I am so proud of myself for sticking to this. There were days when it would have been easy to just say 'oh, I'll do it tomorrow', but knowing myself, that tomorrow would never come. I feel stronger and more connected to myself and super motivated to move onto the next challenge.
Adriene, thank you for bringing these wonderful videos to our bedrooms, our living rooms and our balconies. Thank you for your calm, your understanding and your inclusivity. I never felt out of my depth or ridiculous for not being able to follow some of the movements exactly. You are an incredible teacher and millions of people around the world are better off for it. 
Completing this challenge and falling in love with yoga have been the biggest silver linings of the lockdown and I will look back on this time with some good memories, not just bad ones. 
Thank you also, for acknowledging my daily comments. I'd like to think that it was my discipline that brought me to the mat every day, but I have to admit that on some of those off days when I was lacking motivation, the thought of you not seeing my comment and thinking I had given up gave me the extra push I needed!

1868.0,"March 2020 checking in- started march 1st, today is march 31st (but it's 3:25 am and I'm a night owl who does her yoga before bed)
I've developed strength, breath control, flexibility, balance, etc but i'm most pleased with the off the mat gains I've made.
I cried during this last session, I wasn't sure I could do my own routine so I started off meditating cris-cross like Adriene, and I thought about how difficult this month has been. I started a new job, my favorite event of the year was cancelled due to COVID-19, and I received all my college decisions (with many rejections). And through all of that, I stuck to this, it wasn't always easy but it wasn't hard either. i don't consider myself to be a committed or routine person but I somehow managed and I'm glad I did.


I was able to listen to my body and do what I needed this last session. I think I may restart the thirty days for April because I couldn't even hold my attempt at downward dog for more than two seconds at the beginning of the month.


My final note is that for a multitude of reason I went off/had to go off my antidepressants ( i tried a new sleep medication and needed to avoid complications. Usually when I go off my meds, I cry almost daily, I get overwhelmed easily, I struggle to see all the light in the world. I don't think yoga cures depression as I haven't been severely depressed in over a year but I have no doubt in my mind that yoga has helped with my emotional well being and stability.


 I'm pretty tired and I have work in less than 9 hours but I think I touched on everything major. Thank you Adriene, thank you to anyone reading this, just thank you!

1912.0,"Continuing to explore the yoga/taekwondo connection: This concept of ""melting the thighs"" inward or outward, depending on the posture being built, piqued my interest as I was working through the ""Fundamentals"" series. Being mindful of this helped direct the energy of where the posture was ""going,"" and aligned the joints so as to minimize stress; also solidified the connection from the feet and ankles up through to the hips. This morning, as I performed my taekwondo poomse (patterns or forms), I paid attention to the rotation of the thigh muscles in various movements. Forward stances seem to benefit from melting the thighs inward to provide stability and generate power to the fists. Back stances seem to ""want"" outward rotation to stabilize the knee/ankle connections. When executing kicks, the standing leg seems to prefer outward rotation, as if it were ""opening the gate"" for the kicking leg to move freely. I look at photos of world class soccer players and notice that the thigh of the standing leg, as it plants next to the ball, rotates outward before the kicking leg delivers its payload. This can't be coincidence! Young martial artists are taught to focus on the hips as they perform the various strikes and blocks, while the thighs just sort of ""hang"" there. The result can be a frustrating disconnect throughout the entire skeletal frame as we try to FORCE our bodies into the correct posture. Mindfulness of the thigh rotation seems now like a no-brainer, seeing as it contains the largest muscle groups. Fascinating!",Ugwi76TpKAb1uTrdNxx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-03-11T11:40:02Z,0.9185665845870972

2024.0,"Dear Adriene! I have so much to say, not even sure where to start. I'm a huge 'restarter' in all area of my life, tried a lot of sport but nothing ever sticked for more than 6 months and I never really enjoyed doing anything (except volleyball). I always did moving just because it's healthy but never found anything that really suited me. I'm 30 years old now, first started doing yoga occasionally at 16 and usually did once in a week for 3 months then nothing for 3 months. When I first ran into your lessons a couple of years ago I thought 'this is too easy for me, not really yoga' and never tried any of your practices. About a month ago I decided that my life cannot go the way that I'm living it right now, my health is shitty, I had several issues with my female health and really felt that If I'm not changing my 'moving habits' now, I'm never gonna. I thought I should restart for the 200's time, maybe this will be my last one. I was starting to search how to get in touch easily with my sporty side and rediscovered your program. I've started to do this 30 day challenge and I felt the difference within the first 3 days. I was so flattered, also did not know what brought that very strong change. This practice is so easy to follow, builds up step to step and I have to say a lot of times  it wasn't easy to do at all! üòÄ I'm struggling with depression for years now so some days were really hard, there were days when all I wanted to do is lay in fetus pose and cry but I strengthened myself and started to practice. There were days when I started to cry on the mat due to emotional pain but I had to do the daily practice so I sticked with it. After 3 weeks of practicing I had my double wisdom tooth removal so I had to take a 1 week break during the program but I wasn't afraid at all, I knew that when my teeth let me, I'll take on from where I left. And I did. Today is the last day of my first yoga with Adrienne 30 days program and I cannot thank you enough for bringing me the joy of practicing. Also I started the program like it is impossible for me to do it 30 days in a row due to time schedule issues, I also knew that my birthday will be during the program and I will probably drink some alcohol that day so no way I will practice on my birthday. I did:) Got up really early just because I did not want to skip a day, drank almost nothing because I knew I will do the practice next day too and I don't wanna be hangover at all. That was the moment I knew this time is really different! I hope my message finds you, I really am thankful for every possible positive effects in my life, I also hope that other people who are struggling with similar issues than me will read my message and If it helps at least one person it's truly amazing. Thank you again, and see you in tomorrow's practice! ‚ù§Ô∏è With love, Kati.",Ugzc51eVPj4Bvb5PBrh4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-12-15T18:36:59Z,-0.14523152526535435

2027.0,"Wow, I did it. We did it. No skipped days and it literally feels like one of my biggest accomplishments in life. I had begun my yoga journey 2 weeks prior to accepting this 30 day challenge. Watching the unfolding and seeing my body change has been amazing but what‚Äôs been more incredible for me personally is what yoga has done to my mind. For anyone who ever reads this and is thinking about doing this 30 day challenge, I paired each day with another one of Adriene‚Äôs videos (majority of the time it was the deep stretch vid and the flexibility vid). Some days, I wanted more so I would work on my upper body strength or practice the Bakasana (using one of Adriene‚Äôs vids). I was not able to do the bakasana a month ago due to an unbalance, not much upper body strength and I was the least bit flexible. I can now hold the Bakasana for 5 seconds. I could not even rest in downward dog just a month ago (it‚Äôs crazyü§™)! Yoga has truly shown me how magical the body can be. The connection between the body, the breath and the mind... ahh. I really have no words. The ending to this 30 day challenge is amazing because the more you delve into yoga, you start to discover how intuitive it is. The flow of the sun salutations make a lot of sense, at first it becomes about remembering ‚Äúthe routine‚Äù but then it really does become intuitive. And by no means am I super zenned out or enlightened and although I may seem obsessed with my progress, I am really just in awe in how yoga can transform you in so, so, so many ways.

There is no way I can describe all the good things and life changes that have happened from a seemingly small decision to make space in my room for a yoga mat, but I don't feel it is necessary if you can all feel the happiness and good energy I am radiating towards all of you today...and hopefully will feel every day.

I am super beginner to the practice so almost all the time I wondered if my less than ideal asanas where at least the stone age version of them (Hopefully they are let us pray for zero injuries on all of us). I gotta say, you never notice how atrophied your joints and muscles are until you do yoga. I now think it is probably irresponsible to not serve yourself with this while only focusing on the gym or cardio. This has made me feel stronger every day, more flexible and light. It has given me energy and focus, not at a miracle level at least yet but pretty noticeable. I also can proudly  say I committed to the end 30 for 30 days, sometime in the mornings, others on lunch time and even before sleep. My will feels stronger and now I have decided to do a whole year of yoga.

During that time, I decided to try yoga to keep active and retain some tone in the muscles. Just completed your 30 Days of Yoga challenge and it has rocked my world! These concepts of lifting the heart, creating space in the body, finding your breath, maintaining integrity, and so on... It has changed the way I move and the way I relate to the world (and even the people) around me. Once I am healed enough to practice my beloved taekwondo again, I intend to continue with yoga as part of my martial arts regimen. Thank you for making it so accessible!

first time in my life i did something (except eating, sleeping, brushing my teeth) for 30 days in a row. i learned so much! i tried yoga years ago when i had a gym membership. and i never did it on my own at home. i was under the impression there were so many rules and you had to be semi-enlightened with decades of experience to even attempt to come up with your own routine. 
and now i freestyled the f*** out of this video! haha! 
it really changed a lot. i feel stronger, my posture has improved and i realized i wanna do more things with my body.

2139.0,"Just now was the fifth year in a row that I completed this yoga journey with you Adriene and with this community. I don't have many words to describe the feeling I have but I think contentment is a good enough attempt. It has been a physical, emotional and spiritual road with many ups and downs so I almost can't believe I'm here. From only disliking my body to being able to work with (and not on!) it and some days also enjoying it. Not to mention how much my confidence has grown. It's definitely not what I imagined when I first pressed play of one of your videos. Eternally grateful.

2188.0,"So i lay here after yoga practice tonight and I am so completely at peace. Watching you do your thing free styling was so beautiful to see. I think I did ok ‚Äútrying‚Äù to keep up.  I started my journey this year after reading an article about how to set proper goals. I decided that one of my goals would be to live healthier.  I found another yoga instructor that I stuck with for 6 months but I kept popping over to your channel from time to time. I was gaining some flexibility and losing weight but I felt like I needed more and kind of lost my focus.
Insert miss Adriene.  Watching your lessons, I have been able to find my way again.  Your ability to connect with people is awesome. For about a month I was cherry picking random lessons.  I decided I wanted to start a 30 day series and figured the oldest one would be a great place to start.  I am completely refocused now. In the last 30 days (maybe less cause I seem to want to complete more than  one lesson a day) I have become more flexible than I ever could have imagined, my balance has improved and my weight loss has restarted (it stalled for a while). I can not wait to see where this journey takes me on my way to being a better version of me.  Your humor (although sometimes a little corny) and your ability to keep things lite really has helped me Find What Feels Good.  I even find myself watching some of your vlogs.(your mat cleaner is wonderful). 
I can not thank you enough for doing what you do.
Anyone still reading this, don‚Äôt forget to sign up for miss Adriene‚Äôs weekly news letter, I love and look forward to reading them every Sunday.

2197.0,"Oh, Adriene!  29 days of wellness, and a rhinovirus on day 30.  The dedication and commitment led me to be determined to get on the mat despite the sore throat, runny nose, and nagging thirst.  I really want to keep at this every day moving forward.  I want to say that I do yoga without getting raised eyebrows (I've cultivated something of a Buddha belly over the years).  I want to get in better shape.  Little celebration: my heels touched the ground today in down dog.  I needed two breaks, but I felt like I could breathe better when I was done.
The plan was to move on to yoga for weight loss after this, but I think I will revisit the first week of the 30 Days of Yoga series.  Finding what feels good.  Giving myself time to get over this crud before moving on to more calorie-burning poses.

Objectively this is one-way communication to thousands of people, but somehow you make me feel the love. It took me 6 months to get through...! But it has been part of a recovery since I broke my leg badly a year ago, went through surgery, laid still in a hospital bed for a week, went through surgery again, got home on crouches which I had to use for four months, still waiting for the skin to heal for another month. Before I broke my leg I didn't do much exercise being a typical full time working mom thinking chocolate was the only real treat, so you can imagine that what little strength and flexibility I had had was now completely gone. Struggling with daily tension headache, tendinitis in one shoulder and of cause still pains and swelling in the right leg, I startet seeing a physiotherapist twice a week. And after a couple of months he recommended I checked out your videos to continue the training on my own. And so I did :-) Three to four times a week I have used this 30-days program, going back and fourth, repeating my favorite sessions or just choosing what I had the time or energy for on that day, but never starting a new video without having done all the videos before that. And so today I finally made it. Because of your always including and compassionate comments, and reminding me to think of why I started this, I never felt like it was wrong or not good enough. It was just what suited me, and I never felt like giving up. I now feel strong, balanced and empowered, thanks to your great support - through YouTube-videos, who would have thought it :-) <3",Ugzzd2nqMUkFZ7rZnyd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-06-23T13:47:16Z,0.9977033734321594

2367.0,"Thank you so much for this. For my whole life, I'd been so anxious that I wouldn't 'be good at yoga' that I'd never tried it, despite numerous doctors telling me it would benefit my serious back problems. Then a coworker challenged me to this 30-day practice on April 1, and something in me just decided this was it; I was finally ready to give it a shot. Well, I just finished Day 30 ten minutes ago, and it's hard to put into words how I feel now --- proud of myself for sure, but so much more than that both physically, mentally, and emotionally. After just a month I feel better than I have in years, at age 38. Your work has changed my life, Adriene.

2373.0,"Thank you, Adriene, for helping me get this far. I never could complete a 30 day challenge before, this is the first time I actually do it and in a reasonable amount of time. It took me around 35 days, and within this last month, my whole life has undergone a major change. I now wake up around 6 am, do yoga, then shower, and I'm ready to start my day at 7:30. I had never dreamt that was possible. I don't know how it happened, or why, but I'm glad it did. Everything seems to be on its place now.
Also, I always had short and tense hamstrings. For years. I could never do a proper forward fold, be it sitting down or standing. The other day I followed a mini tutorial on how to do it properly, and voil√†, holy cow, my entire chest and belly flattened over my legs!! I was so surprised I couldn't even react for a while.
Seeing that change makes me believe that many other things have changed, only that I haven't noticed or tried them yet.
This challenge changed me for better, both physically and mentally. I can't thank you enough, Adriene. You are the best. Truly the best.
Greetings from Argentina.

Highly appreciate all of your work, what you share, your time, your knowledge and, above of all, your generous heart that you put in every lesson for us.

2480.0,"Day 30. Originally I started this just as a warm up to help me start exercising again. I wanted to start calisthenics and B-girl dance challenges and strengthen my body in the process but the calisthenics and B-girl channels I subscribed to had exercises that were just too difficult for my level of fitness at the time, and some of the exercises I did were hurting my back (a sign of poor form and poor posture). I didn't give up on the calisthenics plan, but I decided to take baby steps toward achieving my goals and decided to look for yoga instead, for it actually helped me before in correcting my posture and in giving me a more positive outlook on life. I had come across this channel once or twice before and done a few exercises, and seen the 30 days of yoga challenge, and done the first one (and maybe more, I'm not sureüòâ) but I decided to come back and give it a try, hoping that by the end of the 30 day challenge my body would be strong enough and I would be more aware of proper spatial positioning to be able to train and start Chris Heria' s calisthenics program. üòÇ 
Now a little information about me: I STRUGGLE to continue with achieving my goals. It's not to say I've never done it, but that it's difficult for me to have the discipline sometimes to devote myself to something. And THANKFULLY that's changing. This year, and the previous one have been life-changing for me. I'm only 18, but I felt I was in the midst of an existential crisis. I didn't know where to begin or what to do, and for a while I was struggling to take some time for myself (I'd already begun to truly love and respect myself but I wasn't giving myself enough time to sit down and think or be POSITIVE and count my blessings).
I AM SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE COME ACROSS THIS CHANNEL.
I have become much more positive. I've been dedicating MUCH MORE of my time to accomplishing the goals I set out to achieve, and doing things the right way. I loved myself before, but I really have GROWN aware of myself and the beautiful things I have stored up inside me. I've grown stronger, happier, and more confident! I've embraced the inner child and will carry that little girl around with me for the rest of my days, and the coolest thing is that this is only the beginning! I've dedicated myself to completing the 30 days of yoga with Adrienne, and I'll be dedicating myself more not JUST in yoga (I'm a loyal YWA subscriber, haha) but in LIFE. With every ounce gratitude I have I thank you for the lovely encouraging journey I've gotten to take with this channel and with all the other brave and dedicated souls who have journeyed with me and made it this far.

If you would like to see my day to day comments on my journey through the 30 day challenge please see my FB Page for my company Blossom Integrative Health - I commented every day about my feelings doing this challenge - It has truly given me another gift for my wellness journey - I am simply and completely amazed that I can do this at all! I have been disabled for 5 years - I had a long run of HORRIBLE HEALTH OUTCOMES! I have had a heart attack, stroke, colon cander and multiple back surgeries - I have been so crippled with pain and arthritis that I was planning my funeral! I have worked very very hard to get my life back! With the completion of my 30 day challenge - I feel as if I HAVE arrived at wellness, at the rest of my life and with joyful health. I can MOVE! I can BEND! I can get off the floor INDEPENDENTLY! I am amazed at the deeper, for me, more basic truth you teach which is ACCEPTANCE - for yourself, for your clients, for the world - Go at your own pace, share the joy you feel in your body with simple movement! A 30 min. check in to my BODY each morning what a concept! I started an elimination / anti-inflammatory diet nearly 3 years ago now- Whole 30 - done in 60 day increments - 2 or 3 a year - I've had miraculous healing results - I've lost 80 lbs. that's 320 lbs. of pressure off my joints! I have healed thyroid and lung nodules! I have cured my non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, sleep apnea and insulin resistance and pre-diabetes!

2490.0,"At my second attempt, I did it. Thank you very much Adriene, you've been really helpful. After my son's birth I scarcely managed to find time to do a little stretching, let alone do some real workout. Now, thanks to you, my spine is back on track, and I can workout again (and my wife became interested, so I think she'll be next) I followed your routine before and/or after exercising (or without other exercises in the busy days) and I found it perfect: not only you explain the poses and transitions very well, but you also offer alternatives and, in some cases, you incourage us to take a rest, instead of ""cranking up"". The frustration and humiliation of being in a public course or a gym often blocked me to advance, but in the comfort of my home I discovered that I can do the heck I want without judgement, and you are the perfect teacher. Today I actually felt free to do ""my poses"" and so I bagan following you but then I decided to mix in the ""dancing warrior"" and the ""tree practice"" routine, plus some other things from the other videos, plus a lot of cat-cows to make my spine rest and straighten. Now I can't wait to follow your other video series.

I've done years of physio and rehabilitation for those injuries with only slight improvement, often leaving me frustrated and uninspired to continue, mainly do my back being a weak link in the chain. You introduced me to yoga in a light-hearted way, making it fun to join you on the mat each day. I am thrilled to report that my back pain issues have been reduced enough that I felt compelled to stick with yoga every day, and after finishing day 30 today, I can feel that my back is stronger.  I'm looking forward to continuing on with my yoga practice and soon, when my back gets a bit stronger, I'm hoping to join a gym again to fix things overall. As an added benefit, I lost almost 5lbs in just these first 30 days... 20% of my goal! So truly, thank you for what you do! Namaste!

2537.0,"Adriene, I know this series is a few years old and you might not even see this comment, but I just want to thank you for helping me gain so much confidence through this challenge. When I started, I was pretty much a beginner. I had done yoga a few times before on my own and gone to a couple of classes. I had always wanted to be able to know enough about yoga to do it on my own without having to follow an instructor or a youtube video. Not going to lie, at the beginning of this video when you said you weren't going to instruct us on what to do, I freaked out a little and told myself I'll just watch what you do and follow along anyways. But I realized that wasn't fulfilling me so instead of giving up I challenged myself to just look away and focus on listening to what my body needs. and I did it! thank you so much for teaching me how to just let go and find what feels good for ME. I can't even tell you how much I needed that. Now I have the ability to challenge myself in my yoga practice without any guidance. Of course, I'm still going to watch your videos because I'm still learning! But now I feel confident enough to do my own thing, and I plan to keep going every day even after these 30 days in a row.

First time I discovered your channel (forum recommendation) I think it was a flexibility video and I knew I wanted to practice with you. The habit came easily, I knew I would be feeling better if I hang out with you. 
First days were on top of the bed (shhh) then after my friend's scolding I bought a mat and rolled it over the only open space in my room. Now it's silly but I feel like friends with you and the mat.

The other yoga classes were too expensive and too long to stick with. After I found you on YouTube it was easier to get started and stick with the program. Now it's 30 days and I feel a whole lot better. I can move easier and planning on getting back into competing in cross-country mountain biking.

I am so proud of myself for actually doing this, it has been a great journey - although it took me a few days longer than 30days to get here. But I am here. Thanks to you Adriene! When you said ""I'm gonna take off my mic"" I was like WHAT?! I got a little nervous tbh! I didn't think I'd be able to do the Yoga on my own, and I was SO surprised to realize that I am indeed able to do a full Yoga practice on my own. I only took a look at the video from time to time  to see what you were doing, but I totally did my own thing. The practice felt as good as always, BUT I got SO emotional. By the end of the practice, I was even crying. :D I can't believe it's ""over"" now, although of course it's not over for me. I might not do Yoga every single day, but I feel so much better after each practice, i can't imagine living without it! It's something I do for myself, to relax, to calm down, to find what feels good, to feel alive, to be there in the moment not thinking about anything but how my body's connected to the earth and my breath, and... well, there is so much I could say, but one thing I really want you to know Adriene: You did a great job!! I loved how you were giving options for different poses (to make it easier for beginners), how you were able to motivate me, I loved your jokes, I loved you being silly sometimes, I loved how I always felt accepted for who I am, even though nobody could see me doing Yoga, I just knew that it's ok to be where I am right now, and well. Thank you very much for this journey Adriene. I not only learnt a lot about Yoga, I also learnt a lot about myself. Knowing that I am able to do Yoga on my own makes me really happy, and although I'll definitely do some other Yoga practices from you channel, I might also do some Yoga completely on my own! Oh and I'm still wondering about that music playing in the background. There was such nice music today, I'd love to know the titles!! :) Thank you very much Adriene, for everything, from the bottom of my heart. You changed my life!

I'm a preparing for a professional exam (having exam in November this year) & for one of the paper, I attended a class which I thought would help me gain confidence in the subject. It was of a week's duration having lectures of 9 to 10 hours a day which on someday got stretched to 11-12 hrs. After the class got finished, Due to continuous sitting & travelling, I had Muscle Cramps at my shoulders, neck & lower back. It was painful üò´ I was not able to continue this program. But then I realized I must resume it again coz it'll help me reduce the pain & soreness. I started again & finally finished todayüòÑ It has definitely helped me a lot.

I practiced some tree and balances, did lots of venyasas and DD, worked on my breathing, etc.  I'm sure it wasn't textbook but it sure was my own...lol.  My big accomplishment today was getting into a squat and taking my hands to namaste position in front of my heart.  First time i've held the squat without support of my hands - woohoo!  After 30 days, i'm toner and somewhat less sore in general.  This has been a great addition to my diet.   I don't feel ready to do anything more progressed yet so I'm starting over tomorrow with Day 1 of this challenge  :)  Just the fact that I don't plan on stopping is a big deal.  Thanks, Adriene...from a very non yoga type of person (hates meditation, non spiritual, etc) you've made it into something I have learned to enjoy.

After struggling with a mental breakdown almost two years ago, losing all my mates, losing all forms of human connection and emotion etc but more importantly myself, I feel as if this was the boost i needed to begin appreciating my life and start loving number 1. I cried for the first time in a long time after this practice finished... sad, proud, overwhelmed, fulfilled, unfulfilled, uncertain, certain, scared for the future? who knows, I just balled like a baby and its the first genuine emotion ive felt in years. Thankyou! Also thanks to all those in the comment section, I love to empathise with you guys! 30 days is just the beginning. I feel like ive found my thing.

I got calmer, more ok with that which is me. I started to occupy my own space. A much stronger and more defined self has developed that didn't want/have to hide away from others. At the same time, I was more ok with the people around me. More patient.
I had been very hungry for some self-care and I have learned to understand what self-care and e.g.  overeating have to do with each other: more of the first will lead to much much less of the latter. That easy! In order to care for myself, I had to feel that I deserved to spend this time. Adriene, you made me feel welcome and perfectly ok with who I am and what my body could and wanted to do.

Thank you so much for creating such a beautiful program. Today, on the mat, I tried doing some pushups - and I realised that I was so much stronger than I thought I was, even though I'd been taking the push-ups pretty light throughout the program, I managed to get one quite real one in!! It was such a great point, and really inspiring as a 16 year old to be able to empower and start to re-realise all of my wonderful strengths and weaknessness, even though sometimes I don't see them :) . It was such an awesome moment and I'm so motivated to do more Yoga and go to the gym!! You have created such a wonderful atmosphere, and group of motivated, fun, happy people, which is so rare on the internet, and sometimes even in real life - it's so lovely to be a part of. It took me a little bit of extra time to finish this, but from Day 1 I knew I would, with your help I actually did it! I started this program out of pure curiosity and hope that I might find something new to do, and it was such a nice thing to find that really helps heal my body and mind everyday. Just a little amount everyday or so adds up to so much! Thank you so much. 

Throughout this journey I've worked through so many exciting, difficult, and also just everyday things. Thank you, for helping me to become the best I can be - and being that supportive voice that I've been able to work with, even if some days I just wanted to put it on mute and crawl into bed after a long day! Everyday with you has been awesome and going on the mat was given me so much encouragement and happiness!! I'm loving looking forward to continue doing Yoga with you, savouring the moment - and hearing more funny and inspiring things you have to say!  Congratulations to everyone else who has come this far!! Well done. Namaste <3

I used to be more active before it sort of hijacked my life, and I haven't been able to find a fitness routine that worked for me until now. 

I took a lot of pressure off myself when starting this challenge. ""Whenever I don't feel up to it I will skip,"" I told myself. I only rested for 4 days out of the thirty! And about 3 weeks in, on a day I would have normally had a ton of pain and fatigue, I felt normal. I couldn't believe it. 

Aside from that, I have so much more ease of movement, I feel space and length in my spine, I sleep better, I don't wake up achy, I have more mental clarity, and I am seeing small daily improvements in my strength and flexibility. From here on out I am adding a daily morning date with you as part of my comprehensive treatment plan.

2932.0,"It took me more than 30 days, as a few others have noted, but I did the whole thing and it's honestly been amazing. I've dabbled in yoga since high school, but never really committed to anything until this practice. I did a few of the beginner videos, and a couple of the foundations as well, before starting this. After day 2, I thought I'd struggle through the whole thing forever. And I kind of did, but not in the worst way possible, if that makes any sense. It's difficult to do some poses or transitions with a big belly, or with a bad knee, or with a sensitive ankle, or what have you. Sometimes it's frustrating because you get a little behind and then you struggle to rush to catch up. But eventually, it just kind of clicks that you don't have to do the poses exactly the way Adriene does them (though it's obviously the goal!), you just have to do them in a way that's mindful and works for you. I haven't managed to get my leg all the way up from down dog to lunge yet, but I found ways to make it work for me, at least until I do it. And when I was able to knock a pose out in a way that felt great and looked similar to Adriene's, that was just icing on the cake. This is all a long-winded way of saying this whole thing was amazing and great and I'm so excited to start Yoga Camp! (but in a couple weeks, though, I think, I'm gonna spend some time with the foundation videos and just play with more stuff!)

I started getting all teary right when you did in the video lol it's been tough and there have been days where the last thing I wanted to do was get on my mat at 6am (mostly in the beginning), but a majority of the time it was the highlight of my morning, and made me a lot more aware of how I was feeling emotionally and physically so throughout the day I could react to things in a much more controlled way (which as a 16 year old is kind of a big deal, I'm sure it wasn't that long ago that you were my age lol). I'm so incredibly grateful that I chose to do this, and met such a beautiful community through it too. It's actually inspired me to look into becoming a yoga teacher when I'm a bit older, I've been trying to find my passions for years and I've finally found a big one thanks to you.

Thank you so much for letting us being a part of your 30-Day Yoga Challenge video sessions!

3030.0,"Adriene, Thank you. I have tried yoga in the past by going to gyms, classes, and studios. However, no teacher has ever emphasized the importance of keeping it real with your own body. No one has ever mentioned the freedom to move within the poses. I have chronic back pain due to a dislocated vertebrae and I have always been limited in my movement and with constant pain. In the last 30 days,  I have gained strength, flexibility, and confidence. But the most important is that I am in love with Yoga because of you. In the beginning, my downward dog had it's heels way up in the air, and today when I did my forward fold, my nose was BETWEEN my knees!! Thank you for making this series. 

If I was to give any constructive feedback, it would be to make the workouts at least 30 minutes each. I found myself always wanting more and most of the days I ended up doing 2 or 3 of your days in one. I am now looking to mix what you do with fitness yoga.

3062.0,"Adriene, I am very grateful to you, giving me the opportunity to become acquainted with yoga and to practice yoga under your professional guidance.
These on-line sessions, which I can take at any time, resolved any time constraint.
In the past I took a course mindfulness, which to date still has a positive impact on me. Yoga really is synergistic and both contribute to my mind-body balance.
Day 30 triggered some feelings and emotions, heightened by the elegance of your movements and soothing music.
I am looking forward to the next yoga practices ... with a big smile :)",Ugx1i_LwCL2bRnZuSLl4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-03-04T14:30:09Z,0.9998300075531006

With your sessions of different lengths you have taught me that time on the mat can vary. Next, I'll be using your Foundations series. I wish you the very best, you take care.

Today I started the morning doing my own confident yoga practice in the quiet of the morning. It was so satisfying to start my day this way!

3076.0,"Can't believe I managed to finish 30 days of yoga in 30 days! Did not miss a day and honestly don't know why I was so determined. I have never managed to stick with anything - I have tried fitness workouts, meditation, Pilates and I have never been able to keep it up. I have attempted this 30 days twice before and never made it past day 6. But I decided I wanted to make it to 30 and have that feeling of accomplishment so I have been getting up at 5:30 every morning to do this practice before work. I feel so much stronger inside and out, I have so much more energy and notice how much more aware of my body I am in terms of alignment and posture. I never thought i could do yoga, I wasn't that type of person, I wasn't flexible or mindful. I can safely say that I absolutely love yoga and this practice has helped me realise that it just takes a bit of perseverance to find your own strength. Thank you so much Adriene.

Nonetheless, I've decided to be positive and just embrace all the positive things that Adriene's teaching and that yoga's bringing me. All in all, I still thank you for dong this.

However, this video will be one I will replace with something else as I have been doing yoga for about 7 years now and it's not that I cannot come up with a routine at home, it just often gets stagnant and I enjoy not having to think about what I want to do and to be pushed into doing things I normally wouldn't. Its a waste of my precious monthly data to have a yoga video on that isn't doing anything for me unless I am constantly watching it.

3241.0,"I can't believe that I stuck with this for the 30 days, on the mat by 5 am.
My intention was to create flexibility in my back & hip ligaments.   I am stiff in the morning, but after yoga, I am much more limber. Most days, I did not even experience the usual hip discomfort, and on day 29 & 30, I was not even in discomfort right out of bed!!!!!!!!!  When you don't have to live with pain, life is easier.
Another way yoga has helped me is in my focus & stress level.   I love teaching my 18 third graders! This practice has helped me really be able to have a calmer mind, take things in stride, & find humor throughout my day.  I have accepted extra responsibilities, and still not felt flustered. 
I credit all that to 1. Taking time for myself for yoga, 2. Absorbing God's Word into my heart & mind, 3. Incorporating personal development (Jim Rohn, John Maxwell, Tony Robbins) 4. Herbalife natural supplements .   I love what they do for my mind & body, so now I help other people who are looking for those solutions for themselves.

But I didn‚Äôt conquer anything- I didn‚Äôt get the job that I wanted, and all my plans for this year fell through. I have no goals accomplished, no stories to tell, and I was depressed for a long time. I quit from Facebook and Instagram because I just wanted to vanish and to avoid upsetting myself. Then, I stumbled upon this channel, and by the beginning of October, I started with Day 1. I told myself to see this through. Commit. And I haven‚Äôt missed a single day. I no longer wake up late and stay up late. I have also stopped binge-eating and binge-watching. I am thankful to Adriene and to all those who went through this 30-day Yoga because I feel better now, inside and out.

I missed only one and doubled up the next day to make up for it. You are an excellent teacher and I am so grateful that you have brought yoga more into the forefront of my life. I've gone to a few yoga classes over the years with my sister, who got me into it to begin with, but have always felt self-conscious in a classroom setting because I am often the only guy there, and also because I didn't feel as skilled as others. But between the Foundations series and now 30 days of Yoga, I'm super stoked to go and do some public classes, even without my sister there! And this series has really made me discover which poses I would like to work on, and I'm inspired to challenge myself. Love your personality and the smiles you have brought to my days the past month.

I enjoy the slow controlled movement, your sweet spirit guiding me through the movements and reminding me to breath into the back body. You choice of words encourage and inspire me to clear my mind and truly allow my body to enjoy the practice.

Some people say I look like I lost weight, although the scale shows the same, must be the muscles starting to show up from under that lazy, tired, unhappy fat! Also, just noticed my toes bend upwards sooo much and I found it so weird because I didn't work consciously on that, must be because of your feet stretches :O  Unfortunately, now I will be too busy to continue doing it everyday, but this's been a great kick start for what will be a very difficult year in my life, and I thank you :D I loved your jokes and the comment sections.

Well then about 3 years after I graduated I gave birth to my first child which is truly a blessing from god. Little did I know though how challenging it would be for me to get back to who I was as a person. I kept trying and failing and trying and failing and sunk into a deep post partum depression. I didn't even think that existed but it truly happened to me. I knew that it was because I was missing the love I had for self and started abusing my body with an unhealthy diet and no workouts. Well one day I realized I wasn't going to be the same person I was because of course I have a child so I told myself I was going to be better. Your charisma and positive attitude and realness made me believe in myself. Don't get me wrong... there were days that I wanted to quit but I just told myself that Adriene will get me thru. And you did. I have worked out for a total of 30 days, stayed on track with a healthy diet and even pushed to do more workouts. I cant wait to continue to join you on the mat every day!!!

Just completed the 30 day challenge in 35 days and yes it was not so much a physical challenge for me but more so a discipline and an psychological challenge because my mind was always telling me to quit by inventing different excuses or temptations for me to not get on the mat. At the end I succeeded and was able to enslave my mind instead of it enslaving me. Thank you for your daily inspiration, humbleness, patience‚Ä¶ your sharp sense of humor and your ‚Äújust kidding‚Äôs‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and most importantly, your giving without expecting anything in return. You have helped and will continue to help hundreds and thousands of fellow yogis in our path to physical and spiritual wellbeing. 
I will now continue with the 30 day yoga camp and then the Revolution classes‚Ä¶.

Adriene, you say the right things, f.e. on day 5, when you don't feel up to it, you mention that that is possible and not a probleme. I also followed a summer 3-days course and I think I've become a 'yogi'. I'm more aware of me body (which is a bit crooked). So these yoga-lessons are goed to prevent future essues.

I have been struggling with anxiety issues all of my life, and I was looking for a way to figure out how to relax myself, so I came to the practice. 30 days later and I seriously feel like a new person. In the beginning, no matter how long the video was, whether it was 10 min or 30, I found myself getting frustrated, unable to calm my mind. As the days progressed though, a 25 min video went by in a flash, and I didn't find myself aching to get to the next move, something to distract me from my frantic thoughts. 30 days later and I still had moments in the practice where I had to actively calm my thoughts, but overtime I became so much more able to acknowledge my thoughts without judgment, and just kind of let them live. Physically I have found more flexibility (can get my heels down in downward dog), mentally I have found more calm, and spiritually I have found more peace.

I have never been good at moving my body in any complex fashion, needing really clear instructions to avoid confusion and frustration. But, I was diagnosed w/ type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and pre-high cholesterol last year. I changed my diet, lost some weight, but didn't improve my cholesterol numbers or blood pressure much. My doctor said regular exercise was my missing piece... I thought back to my limited exercise history and remembered that one week where I felt pretty good after attempting yoga... So, I searched YouTube, trying a sorts of channels for at home yoga. Nothing really fit me. Then I found you--  Girl, I came to you depressed, frustrated, feeling broken and without any zest left for life. Adriene, you have done for me what no other instructor offline or on has never been able to do: Met me where I was, taught me in the space they way I needed to be taught and inspired me to keep coming back, no matter what. Now, here I am, feeling better than I ever have, with the gift you've given me. I am excited everyday for my yoga time. My body can move in ways I never thought possible. I have a new found confidence that travels off the mat with me. I'm living again, I feel like I have energy to give to those I love again because you helped me find and nurture it for myself.

Since starting your videos I have cut out alcohol, sugar and processed foods. I have started getting up in the mornings. I meditate to control my anxiety. You have completely overhauled my life, and helped me to feel positive about the future. In this particular video, I was afraid at the begging when you said you wouldn't be giving instructions because I thought I couldn't do anything and I'd fail.

3484.0,"Adriene, I wanted to take a moment to thank you. As a high school wrestler, I never foresaw myself ever doing yoga. However, two and a half years ago I suffered a major concussion/spinal fracture injury wrestling that has left me with chronic pain and has taken me out of sports since. I've tried many different treatment programs, including two years of physical therapy, with no real success. However, the last 30 days (admittedly a few more than that... whoops) have completely changed my outlook on my recovery. Not only were the length of the sessions perfect for me getting back into physical activity, but your emphasis on accepting where your body was at in that moment was crucial in helping me take things slow as I am someone who is used to pushing myself beyond what is good for healing from an injury. My neck and head pain has significantly decreased. Recently, I touched my toes for the first time in years, a moment my family actually teared up about because it was my first win physically since my injury. I just graduated high school yesterday and am leaving way more optimistic about my future than before doing the 30 days of yoga.Thank you for everything. I look forward to continuing with your other videos.",Ugj-Zh4i9TJGy3gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-06-26T19:17:19Z,-0.9736077189445496

3505.0,"Despite knowing all the benefits of exercise, I've always been a little unwilling to begin any sort of routine for myself.  I knew it'd be good for me in so many ways, but I've never enjoyed the high energy tossed at me in aerobics videos and the like.  It's overwhelming and tires me out so much and makes me so frustrated some days!!  I've even tried other yoga videos thinking that'd be more my energy, but it's always seemed like some awful chore.  I quickly quit everything I tried over the years (including the yoga!) thinking I just wasn't the type to enjoy exercise and I'd be doomed to force myself into it or I'd just give up.  That is, until your yoga, Adriene!  Your voice is so calm and peaceful, but nothing like a yoga robot.  ;)  You hold my attention, make me feel more positive and at peace with life and my body has felt great!  I've been keeping up with every single day since I first stumbled by chance on your channel.  I had no intentions of actually doing an every day 30 days of yoga thing of any sort, but here I am, 30 days later!!  I actually ENJOY doing it and wake up looking forward to your next lesson.  I am so so so happy I've found you!!  Seriously, thank you soooo much for what you do.  I have depression and anxiety but can't afford any sort of meds.  It's hard to do things sometimes.  Your guidance and positivity make everyday so much more worth it than I'd ever thought.  I feel myself slowly but surely becoming more connected to my child-like enthusiasm than I ever thought I could be.  What an amazing gift that you've given us.  I cannot thank you enough.

A couple of years ago  I felt something needed to be done about my weak back and ebbing energy levels after having 3 children, and joined a weekly yoga group which I absolutely love, but wanted to keep this up regulary as I felt once a week practice wasnt enough and you have inspired me to do this following your very informative and enjoyable classes on here. So little time taken out of my day for so may benefits. And I have been encouraged and keen to keep it up. 
This January  I was also inspired to join a running club and have gone from a non runner to entering my first 10k race in september and running 3 times a week! (a miracle as I have never ever done any form or enjoyed sport in my entire 43 years!)
Yoga so complements my running sessions and helps give me more mobility as i have weak hips and lower back. I can now run and stretch out, without an ache the next day :)

I tried multiple times after that summer to do this program again, but would always fall off the wagon after day 3 or 4. This time, I did it, but it took almost 2.5 months to complete. Today is May 25th, 2017... when I started this time around early March, I had very bad digestion problems that lasted more than 2 months, severe anxiety, and depression. I wasn't showering for a week at a time. I started seeing a therapist for the first time in more than a decade. I went to doctors and specialists for blood tests, colonoscopy, endoscopy, MRI, bone density tests, allergy tests... etc. Everything turned out normal. Last year I had an issue for 5 months where I couldn't sit for long periods and after doctors telling me it's likely an inflamed prostate, it turned out to be CPPS (chronic pelvic pain syndrome). Then last summer for 2 months I had a strange vertigo and off-balance feeling that was almost constant. I wanted to kill myself. Now I realize all these issues I've been having for years and years and getting worse have all been due to untreated stress and anxiety. Anti-anxiety meds had their own side-effects so I've stopped them now. My health has improved drastically in the last 1.5 months. It took me some time to get through this 30 day program because I was alternating between swimming and other body weight exercises and I was exercising 5 days a week rather than 7 as I didn't want to risk injuring myself like I had several times before when I'd go hardcore after long periods of sedentary living then doing the opposite. I took a long term view of my health this time - giving myself 1 year to get in shape rather than 2-3 months. I just want to say thank you Adrienne. This is actually the first workout program I have completed - though not in 30 days. I'm in the best shape physically and more importantly, mentally , than I have been in decades. Tomorrow is my last day at my well paid cushy comfortable boring corporate desk job I've been miserable at for over 2 years with barely a vacation. My unhappiness with work / career has been the primary cause of my anxiety and depression. I know it will be a difficult transition in the next few months as I move to a different city without a job and prepare for what I want to do next at early middle-age (I have no idea what it may be although needs to be in a more creative field), but this practice has helped me deal with difficulties much better than a few months ago, and I'm confident this time I'll be ok. On some level, you have been instrumental in saving my life during a very difficult time a few months ago when I felt I was losing my mind, my body, and thought I have some horrible disease. I can't thank you enough Adrienne! Namaste.",UggSoRjDY5G5PXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2017-05-25T21:50:39Z,-0.3042275479919066

- Having found such an amazing mentor and friend in you, Adriene. Someone who teaches self-love, confidence, empowerment and that all bodies are different and exercise can be fun and good, so long as you find something you really enjoy and always listen to your own body first.

I don't think I can express my gratitude through mere words but I am going to try my best. You are such a kindred spirit to share your time energy and knowledge through these wonderful videos. You are so special that you could make anyone feel connected to you with your warm personality and genuine presentations.

I think of all languages silence is the most powerful to get connect at a metaphysical level. Like you mention in the beginning of day 30 I did rebel (went with y own course -- not on purpose but because of the flow from within), however, never felt disconnected.  At the end my eyes were filled with happy tears and my soul felt light.

I started following what you were doing but I couldn't catch up properly because of not hearing instructions. So I just started doing what I just thought of and what felt good at that moment.

Day 30 was also a huge let down, I'm pretty sure 99% of people came here for guided yoga and then on the last day we are thrown a curve ball where we either have to make it up or keep looking at the video is really stressful and not yoga like at all.

Your way of doing yoga made it care free and easy to practice because I didn't have to worry if I got it wrong. Really helped me with my back problem, anxiety, and sensory processing difficulties.

The focus on self and well being is something that I promote in my classroom.  We are seeing increasing deficits across the middle grades in how our students value self,  cope with trauma and express themselves in ways that are socially and age appropriate.  Our team of teachers have incorporated mindfulness and yoga into our classrooms and have seen amazing results. The kids love it and we love sharing it. 

I will join you and continue to direct my motivations to source energy. I am thankful for you and feel that a rising tide raises all ships. Cheers to our weekend and Thank you again.

I've had problems sitting on my legs and needed two blocks to do this. I'm only using one block now, so making progress! The froggie pose helps me tremendously to stretch those tendons. Thank you Adriene for making videos that kept me motivated and wanting to come back.

Being a 300 pound guy, walking into a yoga studio to learn is not ideal. I found your video series and started my journey. With a passion for getting serious about my health, aerobic and weights just doesn't seem to be enough. Yoga completes the routine.

After 30 days of Yoga, here is what I learned/experienced:
* Anyone can do Yoga
* My body is really feeling good. Minor aches and pains are gone, and I feel very loose
* Sleep at night is better. I notice I don't use the pillow anymore. 
* I've learned to recognize when my body tenses up, and I can tense it right back down
* My anxiety has been much better. I can breathe like I do in Yoga and stay present in the moment. 

Thank you for the experience. I know you have some products out there and more video's, I will be checking these out and figuring out what is next.",Uggdq2su5mFfiHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-09-03T17:07:06Z,-0.8761402368545532

4084.0,Just completed the 30 days of Yoga. Sometimes the hardest thing is just showing up on the mat but it was so worth it.  One thing that helped me was to start at the beginning of the month and the videos corresponded with the day of the month. I also liked challenging myself to complete it in the 30 days by doing 1 video everyday. It helped keep me motivated especially when I was experiencing anxiety or lacked motivation. I even recruited  family or friends to encourage me to get on the mat on days that I didn't want to. Thank you Adriene for your guidance through many levels of Yoga. I set the intention to keep going...Yoga camp here I come!,UghsgubFi50UTngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-06-30T21:44:40Z,0.9988933205604553

4086.0,"At first, I tried to follow along with this video. I kept looking up at the screen to see what you were doing while I did something similar. But then, I don't know, you did something I wasn't expecting or something, because I found myself just sitting & watching. You're right, it is a kind of dance. I found a different appreciation for yoga there. Usually I'm too busy trying to get myself in the right position, maybe watching the video to see if I'm doing it right, or where my arm or leg should be going etc, but just watching was awesome too. I really enjoyed this, thank you so much for sharing. Now I'm going to find some music & do my own yoga movement dance & then maybe study a few more of the foundations of yoga videos too. Yoga is becoming a much bigger part of my life and it's thanks to you (and the person who told me to try 30 days of yoga with Adriene).

4095.0,"Dear Adriene
Thank you so much for guiding us through this awsome 30 days journey! I will be 53 in a couple of days and am still recovering from a accident that severely injured my right knee. Yoga has contributed a great deal to finding my way back to normal. There are poses that I will never be able to do (again), but there are so many others that I have learned over the past six months. I can do anything I want in my daily life, and I am super grateful for that!
Next, I'll try to lose the extra pounds I put on since the accident. So we'll meet again at your yoga for weight loss series :-)
Looking forward to that next challenge, I send you much love and a big hug: take care!

4147.0,"Adriene, 

I've just finished 30 days of yoga, and I cannot thank you enough. 
My fitness levels, general health and wellbeing were at a very low ebb when I found your videos. I did 2 weeks of your various practices before I started following 30 days of yoga - adding in extra practices as and when time allowed. In the last 6 weeks I have lost 20lbs, but far more importantly I have regained a sense of wellbeing. Yoga in the early morning, before my hectic day begins, has enabled me to start each day on such a positive note, and also to deal far easier with the day to day stresses of juggling work and family. I'm now back to being the positive healthy person I was before some health issues arose 18 months ago. 
I've rejoined the gym, am eating incredibly healthily, and am so much happier. 
I am hooked on yoga, and will continue to start every day with your amazing videos.

Though my feet still won't lay flat on downard facing dog, and I can't lift the tiniest toe when trying the crow one, it is a real pleasure everyday and it helps me starting my day full of energy and positive vibes!

Thank you for all the easier alternatives for beginners and the less bendy. My heels are much closer to touching the mat in downward dog, my arms and legs have so much more strength now and all my backache has gone away! Previously, I was stuck in a rut and at a plateau. I was doing a lot of different exercise regimes for the last two years but saw no significant effect on weight loss, health or mental happiness. Your videos are truly a gift. I also stopped eating junk food, fast food and try to eat natural and unprocessed products as much as possible. All together, I have lost about 2+cm everywhere, about 2+ kg weight loss, fitting into some of my old clothes (a size smaller) and feel so darn great in general.

Seriously, thank you. I'm amazed that I completed this - I don't think I've ever managed to do 30 nearly-consecutive days of anything in my life. Your guiding got me here - your sympathetic manner, your clear instructions that FINALLY made it possible for me to do yoga without my eyes locked on the instructor, your humor and your excitement.
And it was so exciting, at the end of these 30 days, to do today's practice and to do my own first ever entirely freestyle yoga - to realize that I have actually learned this amazing skill now, this way to strengthen my body and make it feel good. I'm walking away from this practice with more than a stronger, more flexible body that I'm more aware and in control of - I now have a way to keep it that way.

I'm pretty much of a giver, and so just in these few moments it was nice to feel selfish without the guilt.

I don't have a lot of weight to lose, but being a newer mom and for those who know what it is like being a new Mom and what it demands and the sacrifices it takes to be Mom, I seemed to have lost myself and who I am. I don't know if I would call it post-partum depression, but something happened to me and I lost myself. I gained some weight on top of my baby weight. I was rarely ever happy and never had any energy to really do anything. I wanted to sit on the couch all day and eat junk food and that was pretty much it. Since then, I have lost 16lbs, become WAY more flexible and I have found a great emotional connection to yoga. I am so blessed to have found this yoga series with Adriene and I cannot wait to continue this journey. I feel like myself again but at a even higher level! I want to thank you Adriene for helping me!",UgjeD10Hsm9BdHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-03-02T04:44:54Z,0.8902561664581299

4416.0,"I finished the 30-day challenge few days ago - just in time for the camp series! Adriene's video was the second 30-day yoga challenge I did. At first, I wasn't sure if I was connecting with the practice or with Adriene. However, few videos in I REALLY started enjoying her style and her humor. I wasn't able to do the 30-day consecutively like I did the other series, but I was determined to finish and I'm proud of myself for that. I was involved in a car accident two years ago and I have NOT been the same. I go in and out of pain and my muscles feel stiff constantly. I have gained weight as a result. Yoga helps with every small improvement. Thanks Adriene for doing this. The last day was beautiful.",UgjBBvDlDw9vmXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-01-01T18:09:35Z,0.9991543292999268

4421.0,so just finished the 30 days. did take a bit more then 30 days though since i was ill in the hospital for a while and such. but even there i tried to atleast do parts possible(in a hospital bed) of the bedtime yoga atleast. Started this as a way to begin some training since i have been feeling a need to since i had my child a year ago. So i found this and decided to go for it and even though i'm as much of a beginnig as anyone can be it has been great. like that there are variations of the moves and i can chose what fits me best. i'm still not good enough to do a bunch of improvisation but havnt been any need either. anyway this has been a great way to start off some training and i will totally keep on going. been trying a bunch of the other videos too while doing the 30 days so found a bunch of nice stuff that I really like... like the bedtime yoga which i done almost every day.  been a great way to relax before bed which i need. so i will keep on going. and hopefully this log doesnt have to be so stiff and untrained in the end hihi. anyway... its been great... keep on going. i will keep looking out for your videos. cheers,Ugixg7BRoRi45HgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-12-31T13:30:01Z,0.716179609298706

But, I found different motives each day. About half way through the challenge rather than post poning it until the very end of my day I found myself wanting to do it (yoga) every second of my day!!! It has really helped me find a moment in the hustle of everyday life just to explore myself and think about life all while doing something good for my health. Now, after completeing the challenge I find myself a bit emotional for you have really inspired me to not only continuing yoga but also other things that will have positive effects on my life.

Thank you, Adriene. Before, I used to find your flow a little slow moving but after suffering (and recovering) from an elbow injury, I've come to appreciate the gentle, steady and organic movements with your practice. I've never been as determined and disciplined to be on my mat daily, even just for 15 minutes. Your positive energy is just contagious and you are an inspiration. I can proudly say, ""I have found what feels good,"" and I thank you for that.

I'm so glad you let us discover on our own---I've never once had a teacher let me freestyle though you'd think that'd be the natural progression, it had never even occurred to me. Thank you. And because of that I discovered why corpse pose is so precious. I gave my old awareness that brought me to the mat an acknowledged moment departure. I experienced the loss of it and corpse pose allowed me to comfortably accept that loss, take a few breaths to feel it's absence--the dialectic of the pain and the joy--then open my eyes to what was new. Where else can you find that but corpse pose? 

Sidenote: Also, baddha konasana? More like Badass I Can Asana! ....I've been waiting to make that joke until the end of the 30 days. Love you, Adi.",Ugi_vCwMk-w4bXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-12-07T16:51:06Z,0.9439418315887451

I incorporated this with my 30 day cutting routine & extra cardio as I'm a lifter and heavy into working out. Helped my muscles, strains, & as well as sprains feel more at ease and relaxed through my journey of obtaining my competitive physique.

4529.0,"Wow. I wasn't expecting that last day to be totally open for improv and I didn't know I would like it so much. It was nice to go at my own pace. So it took me more like 60 days to get through the 30 days of yoga and I didn't do them in order, but I saved the 30th day for last and I'M DONE!!!

Thank you for doing these 30 days! I was getting used to feeling just a little bit depressed (if not a lot) and anxious as the norm in my life. Nothing made sense and I had zero clarity. I made a deal with myself to stick to doing yoga because it works both my mind and my body and it has made its way into every facet of my life. My family can tell I'm happier and I feel more confident and at peace. Now the norm is feeling the good things. I just feel elated, and no I'm not on drugs. Just yoga. Lol

So I know this is sappy, but I want to thank you because 99% of the yoga I've been doing has been with you. Not only do you teach us the moves, but you remind us to smile and find what feels good, and I believe I have! :)",UghoXdV0VvmjfXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-11-24T00:58:06Z,0.9935129284858704

Not to over-dramatic but, this has been trans-formative. I'm in a much better place with my body, my mind and myself as a person. This was just what I needed. I have always seen myself as the non-commitment sort but sticking with this for 30 days and just feeling all my aches and stiffness going poof was magical. I just feel empowered. 
""Find what feels good"". I think this will be my mantra for everything future scenario.

Gaining strength and flexibility, actually enjoying hovering cat now, even push ups and working my abs, which I always hated but included in a Yoga practice makes it a bit easier.

I started because: I'm in my mid-twenties, and already I was waking up with a lot of neck and back pain, joint issues, circulation issues in my legs, muscle fatigue after easy tasks, and general lack of energy. I started feeling results after the first few days. I noticed my joints weren't popping as much, especially in my shoulders and neck. At the halfway mark, I had significantly more flexibility in my legs, and had no trouble sitting or standing for long periods of time. Now, after day thirty, I feel better and more energized than I ever have, even when I weighed less and was more active. I haven't woken up with any pain for the past week, and also feel better emotionally. A great introduction to yoga! Thanks again!",UggoNXzTQUiMvHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-08-09T16:07:42Z,0.9866516590118408

I wanted to cry and breakdown for absolutely no reason, everything was either making me mad or sad, and I just felt this darkness over me (which is unusual for me). I came home, YouTubed ""Yoga"" and lucky for me, your ""Yoga For When You're in a Bad Mood"" popped up. I instantly felt connected to you, and by the end of the video I felt a million times better. I looked more on your channel and found this challenge and could not have been more excited to start. You have given me peace, stability and inner strength and I can not say thank you enough for being you. I am tearing up as I'm typing this, because I have been dreading this day simply because I did not want it to end! But, I just did the entire video free style (even rewinded a few times so I could make it longer!) and feel confident that i can keep my practice going and find what feels good.

I am a 42 year old wife and mother of a 20 year old and a 17 year old, who was stiff, a little overweight, struggling with A.D.D. and I had arthritis pain. I started your videos a little over 2 weeks ago and I can't believe the change that I can already see. I rarely feel any arthritis anymore and I have lost almost 5 pounds! I am also a full-time college student online and I can see where my concentration is a little better without my meds, which is huge! Whoo Hooo :) What's also cool is that you have motivated me immensely to do more and more.¬†I found myself after finishing the video for the day, going to next day and doing it as well. Then looking at foundations and making sure I was doing things right...it has been a blast!
I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every session and I am very excited to start what ever you have next!! Your a joy to watch, beautiful inside and out, and I love that your down to earth, and you make me laugh! Thank you so much for doing what your doing and keep up the good work!!

4799.0,"Just finished 30 days - absolutely LOVED it!!! Your style of teaching, along with your positive and upbeat attitude really kept me going, especially when i was struggling with some of the more challenging poses. I can't believe the difference in not only my strength and flexibility but also in my posture, I consciously move my shoulders back and down and walk tall instead of hunching them forward all the time. My hips used to creak and I had quite stiff knees, but both seem to have eased up quite considerably which I am really pleased about. I am also sleeping alot better than usual, which is a bonus because I do shift work rotating from days to nights (life of a nurse!). 

So thank you Adrienne for posting this on YouTube, I look forward to going all the way back to day one and working my way back through the 30 days again! As well as working my way through some of the other videos you have posted!

Namaste x

My knees were starting to hurt a little too. I guess that's what happens when you get old! Probably the start of arthritis. I now have a lot less stiffness in my joints after doing the 30 days! I've done yoga-ish stretches over the years but have never actually practiced yoga because I didn't think my weak, carpal-tunnely wrists could take it. But guess what?!

4847.0,"Before embarking upon this journey with you, I'd have watched Day 30 and mainly stayed in the position of Sideways Dog Face throughout it all. But today? I followed right along with everything, including the crow. Before this program with you, I had done yoga twice ever. The second time the instructor told me I wasn't ready for his class because it was too advanced. (Keep in mind, this was my first time back to exercising after a year off from surgeries. I was slightly disheartened, to say the least. ""Sorry I can't twist in a pretzel, Sven. But I promise I'm trying my hardest. I think that's more important than my level of expertise."" <-- I didn't say that. I cried and left. But I WANTED to say that.) ;-)

It has been refreshing to work alongside someone who is passionate about life and people AND yoga. (I mean you... Not Sven.) Thank you for your fervor and for your vulnerability and for catching me the many times I fell.

4867.0,"Thanks so much for these 30 days, Adriene. ¬†They have been life-changing for me. ¬†I started from absolute scratch on day 1, with goals of improving my flexibility (which was terrible from years of neglect re: that aspect of fitness; I'm now in my 40s and 'fitness' is taking on a new meaning for me) and learning how to breathe properly and well (in part due to occasional struggles with anxiety). ¬†I achieved those goals and so much more with your program. ¬†I've been telling lots of people about how great it's been for me and directing them to your YouTube channel.

This 'Find What Feels Good' self-guided session is a perfect way to wrap up the series, in my opinion. ¬†At first I was disconcerted and even a little disappointed that it wasn't going to be the same type of 'lesson' I had gotten used to, but after a minute or two I found my body was automatically finding those familiar poses and stretches and movements that have been most beneficial to my back and joints, proving that I have really learned and retained and made habitual all of those good and wonderful movements. ¬†It was a happy revelation.

Your work is vital and important and, as I said, has changed my life for the better. ¬†Thank you!",UggEff6ouOeBUXgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-06-11T16:49:47Z,0.9990814924240112
4868.0,I missed your suggestions in this one. I did not feel the need to watch the video every minute but found myself backing it up to the beginning of poses that I wanted to do with you. I am not in shape at all and your pace is faster when freestyling but I like the electronic camaraderie. I am glad I found this series for my first experience with yoga. It took me about 38 days to complete the challenge with a weekend of camping without wifi and some hesitancy in the beginning using a lack of mat as an excuse. I can't wait to try out some of your other videos. Throughout the series I felt comfortable to try and didn't get discouraged.

Before I was carrying around a ton of conscious and unconscious stress/tension and now I'm so much better at letting all of it go. I feel so much calmer now, as well as aware of both my self and the outside world.¬†

Thanks again!

Therefore, I decided to start the 30 Days of Yoga Challenge on May 1st, and now on May 30th I cannot believe how wonderful it has been! I was a foreign exchange student in the U.S. back in 2012 where I did a lot of yoga, but haven't done too much since. Discovering your channel has totally made me want to do more yoga again, and last week I even had a wonderful chance to try SUP yoga, combining to things that I really love. Yoga reminds me of good old memories from The States and definitely creates new ones that are worth remembering. It has been such a pleasure and so relaxing doing yoga everyday in a time filled with finals, work and full to-do-lists.

I had just gone through a month of serious stress and anxiety, took a mental health day from work and knew I needed to do something different. I typed in ""yoga"" in that there YouTube search box, and lo and behold, ""Yoga With Adriene"" drew my eye. This has been a monumental help in my desire to gain more balance in my life. I also have semi-severe scoliosis, and these 30 days have really helped me to tune into what my body needs and focus on strengthening my core (which is oh, so important for chronic back pain sufferers). This last video was my very favorite. There's something intimate about doing yoga together with another person (be it a complete stranger...on a television... from 4 months ago...and doing completely different postures at completely different paces).

I feel stronger, happier and more independent. I like the way you lead me through the process of self love. I haven't been loving myself all that much during the last week of this challenge due to relationship issues, but each time I walk on the mat yoga was able to help me heal.

4951.0,"Dear Adriene,
You have changed my whole perception on what I thought my relationship with yoga would be like. I never ever thought that I could even sit still and do yoga for 5 minutes, leave alone a whole month. I always thought the pilates/cardio way was the way to go to lose weight and be fit. But since I started watching your videos, I was so motivated by your voice and your wise words and also the way in which you go about doing yoga. Its so refreshing and your voice is as soothing as any music that should be heard whilst practicing yoga. I can't even think of going back to anything else after having practiced with you. I am actually excited every morning to get on my mat and do some yoga.¬†
Sorry my thoughts are all over the place but I just really wanted to thank you for being so amazing and doing this for me and for everyone else. You have turned me into a much more patient, confident and flexible person <3 Yoga really heals everything.

We are always waiting or wanting more when we should just enjoy what we have now.

5139.0,I love challenges and yoga was an interest of mine when I started this challenge but I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I never knew how good my body could feel by finding what feels right and breathing with such flow. This challenge has helped me move into my body and aid me every single day to strive to be a better version of myself. Even my practice outside the mat has given me such a gentle outlook on finding what works with my body. I will continue this practice and I am so grateful I was introduced to such an expanding way to move my body and so much more.

5145.0,"Hi Adriene! I have no idea what made me decide to start yoga. I guess I just kind of always wanted to try it but not really interested in going to a studio all the time. So I realized I had a yoga dvd that I bought who knows when! Was still in the wrapper! Popped that bad boy and was getting into it. Then....it stopped...the dvd....just frooze...Yes the NEVER USED dvd STOPPED!!! I was so annoyed! So took to the internet in search of review of other similar dvds. Then you popped up! I decided to look at 1 of your videos. Said to myself, ""Huh, I think I like this chic! 30 days...ok I'll try it!""
So the 30 days was probably more like 45! But I have to say I really enjoyed the experience! It has helped with other workouts that I like to do. My feet are actually becoming more flexible which I found so odd! Never would have thought about feet flexibility before! Still not quite able to bend over and touch my toes. But I'm soooooo much closer to doing it without bending my knees so much. Anyway, I am sad this series is over. But of course, it really isn't over. I can still watch every day. I feel like I'm sending off a friend who was staying with me for a while and now is going home. A little sad. I want to thank you for this series! It's really great! I look forward to doing it again and the other yoga videos you have. So really, this is not good bye at all!

This challenge was so worth every second of time I spent doing it. I feel great! I really liked following your instruction Adriene!

I'm going to continue doing your videos Adriene, but thanks to the end of this challenge I think I'm going to start putting more of my own sequences together, and practicing with small groups of people.

I saw some UK vlogers talk about you and your challenge, and took it my self, I finish 30t day yesterday, and wanted to tell you how much you helped me. I have back problem, last year because of my back pain I was on bed for 3 weeks, I even can't go to the bathroom, I went to doctors and had to take pain medicine, and it was crazy bad. I did get better, but some small weight on my back and it was bad again. But now, I fell so much better, I am continuing yoga, and doing your 30 day challenge again, because I was new to yoga and every day was hard for me, and I had to look at the video a lot, but I want to learn to do it by may self. One more thing, my stress and anxiety, you helped that too. I will stop talking and just say I am sad that I can't go to your class, bet I am tankful for Youtube, and that I can learn from you.

Take care, I really really like you.

I found the challenge about a week after it started, and I started following along. I made my intention to balance between pushing myself past laziness to get myself on the mat and listening to my body and making allowances for my illnesses- mental and chronic pain- without shaming. It took me a while, since I did each video in order even if I missed a few days, but I'm finally through!
This was a great experience. I feel like I've really grown and learned so much about yoga, and gotten past my cautious beginner yoga habits! Your videos are so supportive, understanding, and freeing.
I've been a bit wary of the concept of ""creating"" a home practice for myself, just because the individual poses and transitions between them seemed daunting, like I wouldn't be able to make something that would work for me and feel complete. But this last video was way easier than I thought! I doing think I would've jumped right into it if it weren't for today's video, so thank you for that. Even though I've been going in my own time, I feel like I've been sharing this journey with you and a whole community of people, thank you so much for doing this challenge!",UgjyPB6ebl_J4ngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-02-22T23:34:26Z,0.9983273148536682

My niece told me about your 30 day challenge and your unique approach to yoga. I just finished the 30 days, although it took me about 45. I am going to be 51 next week and have been doing yoga for about 16 years. However, I have always been very tight and not very strong, so doing studio yoga was hard for me. And I would end up feeling beat up for days after.

But, your 30 days has made more difference than any other routine I have done. I don't know if it was the fact that I was doing it 3-5 times a week or just your gentle approach, but I have made such a lot of progress in my strength and hip flexibility. The change is pretty amazing.

I felt horrible being so stressed with no yoga practices at the end of the day. this last day of 30 days of yoga was left for me and I had no time. today I had emotional breakdown. I was so tired of all the works. I was looking like a real zombie and then I just put all my works away and went on my yoga mat to finish this journey. no matter that I am so many days late but I'm so happy, free and in love with yoga. I cried a lot. firstly from how how tired my life was lately, later because yoga made me feel good, later because of how happy I am and then I couldn't cry anymore 'cause my smile took over. thank you, Adriene for this journey. thank you helping me find what feels good. this 30 days gave me more than I could ever wished for. namaste.",UghGY6HXshvLY3gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-02-10T21:14:40Z,0.9915961623191833

I started your 30 day program about a week late and only missed a single day after that.

I felt lighter after and a spirit of gratitude. I am so thankful to have participated in this challenge and make it through.

At the end of last year when I was putting together my new year's resolutions, I decided that one would be 'get back into yoga', although I knew it was somewhat wishful thinking. Then along you came with your 30 day challenge and it was exactly what I needed to get me going and a perfect start to the new year. I have noticed so many changes, both in my body and in my general outlook, and I am so grateful to you- even a week ago I would have been terrified by the thought of 20 minutes solo practise, but it flew by and I had the best time. Everyone in this community is so positive, and that's rare to find on youtube. I'm so impressed that I managed to stick with every single day, and I'm sad for it to end, although I think I'm going to go back to the start and notice how I've progressed since the beginning of January.

The past 30 days with you has been such a pleasure. I hope you know how thankful we all are that you've brought us on this journey with you. This new year my resolution has been to recognize the beauty in my life and everyday when I say what I'm thankful for this practice has been on my list.

So thank you for learning me that my body/mind thrives on daily yoga and that i am an expert on what my body needs, and am able to decide for myself what to do. Will make more of an effort to listen to my body and what it is telling me.

I was keeping an eye on the video and the biggest and best thing that happened in this practice was at the end, I thought about skipping the crow as I struggle with it, but instead I gave it a go, just with the intention of growing the pose. First time, nada. Second time, I fell over onto my head; and I just laughed. No frustration, no judgement, just joy at being on the matt. Third time, I soared. I held crow pose for so much longer than I ever would have imagined 30 days ago.

And that's what this all about; allowing, forgiving, embracing, loving, letting go of that which does not serve. I feel amazing, physically and mentally.

I loved coming to the mat every day with new poses and routines, but today-Day 30-I was initially disappointed I'd be on my own. I kept the video on to refer to, and closed my eyes in a seated pose to focus on my breathing. Then something unexpected happened- I let my concern for ""following directions"" go and went with my heart. The poses I did were so organic and I knew what I wanted for my practice today. I even continued going after the music stopped. 

It is a wonderful gift you've given us in these 30 days. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Namaste. ",UgjSleWxyNu6engCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-02-01T08:26:45Z,0.99907386302948

5542.0,"This was hands down one of the most beautiful finishes to a Challenge I've ever encountered. It was a time when you let us take the reigns and I did, I went rogue and I was amazed that I knew exactly what my body needed. I peeked at the video to see where you were and followed about two or three sequences but the rest of time it was all me and my mat. There was this one instance after I had just finished going through all three Warrior sequences into Dances Pose and as I reached my hand out I looked into the mirror that was in front of me and it was like I was reaching for my own hand and taking it. It was one of the most surreal, beautiful moments that I've ever encountered in Yoga and I will never forget. The ability to reach out and take my own hand, was just. I can't even express it. As I looked up into the mirror for the first time I smiled genuinely without being asked and that doesn't happen often for me. If there was one thing I really had to say about Adriene as a Yoga teacher would be she cares for you like a family or a friend. During this last practice I felt like I had friend standing next to me and even though we are at completely different levels. I was proud of the both of us. For committing, for letting go, for cultivating, for being us, in this space, right here and right now. Even though this challenge is over. Our Yoga journey continues and I will carry this feeling of gratefulness, of thanks, and of being in the moment with me forever. Thank you Adriene.

¬†my commitment from now on ¬†is to do yoga every day or every 2 days. I know I can do that. :)
