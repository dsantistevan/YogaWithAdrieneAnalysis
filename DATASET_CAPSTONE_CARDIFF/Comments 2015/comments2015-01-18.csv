106.0,"Since I‚Äôve been doing yoga I‚Äôve noticed that my anxiety has actually lessened a bit. I‚Äôm able to tackle assignments and online schooling with a calmer mindset? Idk. I used to get easily overwhelmed (ADHD) and get panic attacks, but creating a routine of waking up at 7:30 a.m. to do yoga has improved my ability to tackle the day. 

I run as well as do strength training. I used to think these exercises alone would supply me with enough endorphins but no matter how much I ran I still felt anxious. Adding yoga to my life has been one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made. 

Yoga made me LISTEN to my body. Instead of tiring it out, I‚Äôve now been paying attention to how yoga energizes my body and mind while calming the relationship between the two. I‚Äôm stronger now in all the microscopic ways that running and strength training overlooked. 

So while strength training makes me a better runner, yoga has made me a better athlete (and student) overall.

But as soon as the tempo between the poses started to increase my back locked up in the same way that it has been since I was 12 (I'm 25 now) :( I don't know what to do anymore. During all these years I've tried everything, but my body has been just as bad during the times I've been fit as the times I haven't trained at all.  It's so hard to keep motivation when your body just keeps failing on you. I've had my knee and shoulders dislocated several times for no reason at all and my back constantly locks up. These 30 days of Yoga have helped quite a bit and I'm thankfull for that and sorry for writing such a negative comment. But I have nowhere else to turn. My friends and family knows my injuries but I can tell they really don't understand how depressed and hopeless I actually feel about this. I don't want to be that friend that you always hear you should get rid off.

I can't believe I made it this far! this is the first time I did something for my health,, I tried jogging but only lasted 3 consecutive days, then I quit, and never again did some exercise,, until I started this 30 days yoga challenge! I started this because I feel dizzy one day,, I thought it will pass, but after 3 days, all the symptoms points to vertigo. my aunt has vertigo so I pretty much know about it, I'm afraid that it's because of my ear, I had a small wound inside coz I'm careless, or maybe because of lack of sleep, I don't know, (I'm afraid to go to the doctor) so anyway,, I noticed that I'm loosing my balance,, but I can still walk, but it's not the same as before, I don't feel my normal self. I'm not dizzy all the time, just when I'm walking or standing. Still, I don't feel normal. My aunt had rehab to regain her balance,, since she lost her balance when she had her first episode of vertigo, it was really bad. So, I was afraid,, I didn't tell my family what I'm experiencing , I started copying my aunt's exercises that she learned from her physical therapist. Then I started this yoga challenge, at first week, I have two consecutive days that I didn't feel dizzy,, as of today,, I didn't feel dizzy for about a week now, I'll continue doing this even of I'm not dizzy anymore,, Thanks for this, Adriene!",Ugzbr2wYbtd5sS8y5Uh4AaABAg,2.0,0.0,2017-08-07T03:57:22Z,-0.9956570863723755

564.0,"Dear Adriane, 
I am a 28 year old girl from Germany. Due to my job I spent long hours sitting at a desk in front of a computer all day long. 
My mum and sister recently told me about your 30 Days of Yoga ""Class"" and I've joined my sister doing ""Day 18"" yesterday. 

I've been having lower back problems for the last 4 months (aching really bad!) and even manual therapy wouldn't help. 
I am not 100% sure if it was only beacause of this exercise but last night my spine finally clicked - what a relief! 
Thank you!!

This morning I continued with Day 19 and I haven't felt this relaxed on my way to work for years. 
Keep up your great work, namaste from Stuttgart, Germany to Texas!

731.0,"Balance not being my strong point I tried and miserably failed at this so just practised the leg stands trying to lift my legs up on one leg without falling over. Cramp in my calves was also a problem but I tried my best and felt pleased that I did try to do some sort of balance.
As always loved the warrior pose and did it with my daughter yesterday when she came down for tea. She says when she does it she imagines a blue force emitting outwards from her finger tips. I tried to do the same but my was not as far reaching as hers well actually more a damp squib but it was there. LOL ¬†:)
When we had finished today I was there on the floor thinking of stretches I could do on the floor so I did some of those knees up up chest and out into a piked(?) position then straightened them out and brought them back to my chest. Did some lifting of the legs alternately from the floor. Then practised lifting my arms straight out as though reaching to catch something from the ceiling. Relaxing them down in a controlled manner to the floor and not just letting them drop was hard. Then some full body stretches and finally breathing and then wrote this epic comment. ¬†:)
