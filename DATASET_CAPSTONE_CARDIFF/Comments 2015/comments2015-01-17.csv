I‚Äôve been struggling to do this every day when I started which then I gave myself an allowance to do it at least 3x per week to keep myself motivated. There are certain weeks that I dont feel like really doing anything physical and just sit in front of my computer for my 8 hours online class everyday. There are also days where my anxiety just take over me and my day where I left with nothing but tiredness at the end of day. Logs of shits happened but hey!

48.0,"Day 17: Yoga with Adriene - Happiness Boost Yoga. Name doesn't lie folks. Lol. We spend the first half of the session getting some good stretching in, getting our breathing relaxed and focused. Then we move into balancing poses. First on hands and knees, opposite arm and leg extended. I really struggled with my balance these poses. Fell over a few times, on top of them being a bit strenuous to hold, especially in the core. I found that once I got a blanket under my knees and moved my foot slightly towards the center I was able to better balance and focus on the pose instead of falling over. Then we move into standing balancing poses. I didn't struggle as much with these ones, but I listened and kept my knee towards my center, and actively used my hip instead of sinking into it. Really made a huge difference in my balance. Was a really fun session and I'm feeling good after it. Thanks for a wonderful session Adriene!

Adrienne, I really appreciate you putting this together as a 30 day ""course"".  It means I just make one commitment at the beginning - ""I will do the 30 days.""  Then I don't have to think, I just do it.  When I have to pick a new video each day, it takes more energy, more commitment, and now, as a 73 year old novice to yoga, it's too easy to procrastinate or come up with some excuse.

3. I love you, Adriene!
4. I have some medical issues (MS, huh) and my doctor prescribed me some physiotherapy and excercises. It included some elements of yoga, but it was more like - do that and repeat it 10 times, no focus on breath etc and I hated it.

Imagine what you could do if you weren't sick, or if you put your energy toward something that mattered to everyone?"" Usually I'd feel guilty and sad because of this.  Today I became protective of myself.  I told that voice that, ""doing yoga with Adrien makes me feel better and I am getting a lot more done in my life because of it.

289.0,"Day 17 ‚úîÔ∏è Hi lovely friends! It's really so cool to see how so many of us are synchronized with some of the things we do and how we feel as we progress through practice; things like practicing outside for the first time (I did today as well!) along with shifting the mindset of judging myself for everything I couldn't do (yet) and, like you said, going into that ""chill zone."" Haha, it really reminded me of Bruce Lee's quote to be like water and really be in the ""flow"" of yoga. Instead of comparing and judging myself, I make the adjustment, do my best and keep moving. 

No doubt this has truly helped my resilience, and I've been turning these practices with you into something I enjoy and do forever! Haha, but honestly things are so different for me now. I feel like all the hard work I've been putting in for myself in silence on my yoga mat in my little room has really humbled me; to think a mat and a floor and good vibes can improve your connections with yourself and the universe. It also feels odd because when I was going through some difficult times alone, I turned to yoga to pick up my health again. And now that I'm getting better mentally and physically, so many people I talked to (""friends"")  have been calling me lately and telling me about all the bad things that have been happening in their lives (it's almost like bad things sniff out the good energy), and this time around I'm really practicing not feeling guilty for mindful of my own energy and time. I used to think it was narcissistic to care about your own feelings, but now I've realized that it was something taught to us, that guilt to take care of ourselves, so that others could more easily take advantage of us.

Man, I had a lot to say today. Thanks for reading if you did, and don't forget that I and many others have love for you and your hard work. Namaste üôè",Ugy8xdHMoARmGE1lbvt4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-11-15T07:07:53Z,0.9914836287498474

This way I make sure to ground, not grasp with my toes and hurt my arches, but to lift up and breathe.

When we did this for the first time I couldn't nearly do the proper boat pose and recall myself having quite some trouble even with the easier variations. I haven't even done this every day as I missed out on at least a week due to becoming ill and taking a while to get started with exercise again. Despite that, now it actually felt really easy, I wasn't even struggling!

And I'm surprised by how good my balance was. The biggest problem with the balancing poses was my balancing leg becoming REALLY tired. 


Even though this doesn't even feel like that much daily as it's just 12-35 minutes and it's most often more relaxing than exhausting it's clearly having a really large impact! It's pretty crazy!


Aah might as well add that I've only done side planks the two times that you've had us perform them and the second time was much easier even though that was the first one I did after recovering from the illness!

755.0,"Oh, I needed this. Thank you for decluttering my mind! Everytime I think I will go crazy with worries or to do lists, it turns out that leaving the thinking and focusing on the body is a 100% refreshment.

I have a question or request too. Would you please consider making a ""Foundations of yoga"" video for King Dancer pose? In the full (or fullest, let's say) version? It tempts me more than anything. (Well, full version of pigeon too but I have to leave it for a while due to a knee problem.) I feel like the balance and openness will feel like a tremendous achievement, physically too, but mailny mentally. The most important thing is that I know you will make us go slowly and effectively to it, and every ""in the middle"" stage will actually feel completely meaningful and important, not like ""something for the unflexible or weak people who can't go any further"". I know that I could feel satisfied with all the stages, and slowly go to the full version. I am especially curious how to stretch the arms back, because I already know (and feel) there are elements in my daily practice that will slowly help me stretch my back and open my hips. The arms though are a mystery.

One comment though. At the end of the practice i just wanted to lay in shavasana for a while. It was a nice practice and i wanted to enjoy how my body felt. But now with the new youtube thing that at the end of a video a new video automatically starts, i had to get up and go to my computer to turn the new video off. I know it's not something you can control, but maybe at the end of the video (if the practice asks for it) you could leave a couple of minutes with nice music for the shavasana. Well, just it was just an idea... ¬† ¬†;)

I'm not really a beginner, but my body kinda is... haha. So my request is: could you please do a flow/sequence/day a little more slowly? Just about a breath more in each pose, or something similar, would be amazing. I find that it takes me a little extra time to get into a pose, and I usually need to make every adjustment/check-in you offer. So I'm usually running about a pose behind the video, and catch myself trying to catch up, rather than experiencing each posture or movement.

865.0,"Can't believe I'm on Day 17!! ¬†My husband has joined me on the weekends for these now. ¬†We have 6 kids, ages 4 to 16. ¬†My 4 and 6 year olds join me doing yoga on some days. ¬†They don't often do the whole practice, but it is so cool having them just do any and just want to be there with me. ¬†It's not quite as relaxing as when they let me do it on my own, however! ¬†Today, the four year old taunted my husband and I with her flexibility in touching her toes on the floor and in doing the V-sit with no effort. ¬†It reminds us that that is what our bodies were meant to do all along! ¬†It will take time, but I hope to get back to my four year body in that respect. ¬†",UgiAJ8I_Ds40-ngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-01-18T14:08:18Z,0.9333115816116333
