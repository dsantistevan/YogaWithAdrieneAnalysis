32.0,"Day 21: Yoga with Adriene - Joyful Home Practice. Its been a few days since I've done my practice. I haven't been sleeping well. I've been super unfocused and have not been able to bring myself to get a whole lot of schoolwork done. So I hit the mat again in hopes of 1, bringing myself back to my practice and 2, letting go of some physical energy so that I can bring my mind to follow and focus a little better. I didn't move as well through my practice as I may have, had I not skipped a few days. Brain was foggy through my practice but I followed along and tried to keep my attention on my breath. The breathing was good and we spent a lot of time with our hands at our hearts. That is my favorite position. It brings together breathing and stillness and mindfulness. That is something, I think, that we could all use more of in our lives. I know I certainly could. Thank you for a great practice Adriene!

567.0,"Dearest Adriene, thank you so much for this practice - it is my absolute favorite one so far of the 30 Day Challenge, and the most beautiful birthday present I could ask for. After feeling kind of tired and really stressing over all the things I need to accomplish, time on the mat just FLEW by. This practice was so eye opening and somehow emotionally moving for me, and I felt such a deep sense of connectedness to my body like I don't think I ever have (?). Just joyful. :) Thank you. Today's word for me is BLISS. <3",UgiP9YKqWWEbtngCoAEC,4.0,45.0,2015-01-22T12:42:21Z,0.9996172189712524
