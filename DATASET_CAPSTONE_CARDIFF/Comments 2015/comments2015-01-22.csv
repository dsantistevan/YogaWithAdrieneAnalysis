220.0,"Honestly I thought yoga was just another over hyped thing thin fit people liked to brag about, every time I tried it I either hated it or got bored, and I definitely didn't see how doing a couple of weird stretches could in any way improve your thoughts and mood. I'm wrong a lot but damn have I been major wrong about yoga. Day 22 and not only do I look forward to the weird stretches but I am now extending the practice past the video because I enjoy it so much. On top of that around day 19 I started noticing I'm kinder to myself, my thoughts are a bit more gentle and little less self loathing. These 20-30 min yoga sessions are actually sneaking into the rest of my life and changing destructive thought patterns that I've been battling for years. Yoga is wild my dudes🌟",UgwPw3ppN6mbkhyyqDl4AaABAg,6.0,485.0,2020-01-22T17:18:19Z,-0.7428978681564331
221.0,"This morning, my yoga motivation was super low. I have to be at work a couple hours early, which means I have less time to study, clean, fold clothes, make and eat lunch, make and pack a dinner,  and get ready for work. I briefly considered skipping the lesson to give myself another free half hour, but I repeated my mental mantra: ""If you don't do yoga today, right now, you will hate yourself later."" I spent the first half of the session just going through the motions, thinking about all the things I needed to get done in the next couple of hours and how noisy my upstairs neighbor is being. Somewhere around the midway point, my mental state completely flipped and I didn't care about all that I had to do. After the session, I'm not stressed anymore, and I feel like I can totally conquer today. Thank you so much for these videos, they are a blessing to my physical and mental health.",UgyczhOxpfBLPRJWt7l4AaABAg,1.0,5.0,2020-01-22T01:20:27Z,0.9583278894424438

237.0,"I’m behind two days but it’s okay. On the 7th day of this challenge, I started to get sick. And then I got an infection and it all lasted for 4 weeks! But throughout, I was able to make myself do this everyday. No I forced myself to do it everyday!

I am a very sickly person (trust me I get sick a lot). And everytime I’m sick I usually fall into depression. 

But for the first time in my life, after pushing myself to do yoga everyday, I can finally say that I am fully recovered and throughout my sickness, there was NOT a day where I felt depressed! Everyday, I was able to keep my mind in a positive state and because of that I felt like I was able to go through anything! 

Instead of staying in bed all day, being depressed, I was able to motivate myself to do get up and do yoga, get my mind relaxed, let out all the negative energy and go through the day with ease and no anxiety! 

This is truly a life changer. I’m not saying that Yoga healed my infection but it did help me go through it with positivity. And I love the feeling. 

And I really like the effect of yoga on my body. I usually have neck and back pain but all of that are gone! I tried to do yoga in the morning and afterwards I would always feel energized and super motivated to do a lot of things. I used to hate doing things! I used to always just love spending all my time being at home, watching movies and just be like that all day but now I’m super down to do anything, meet anyone, just bring it! 

I love the person I’ve become and I really want to keep it this way, Thank you Adrienne like you have no idea! I fall in love with Yoga and will forever be in love with Yoga ❤️",UgztS3Hy5fRHtbUIjC94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-11-27T03:38:12Z,0.9971877932548523

240.0,"Day 22 ✔️ Just two epiphanies that I would like to share. The first one is that, I didn't feel like doing yoga today; I just felt so sleepy and I almost convinced myself to go to bed. But then I remembered something. Often, there's been times where I've done things for people when I didn't feel like doing it, but I did it anyway because I was too weak to say ""no.""  I didn't feel like working out today, but I knew that I wouldn't regret it after. So why don't I say ""yes"" to myself, when I've willingly said to others in the past--and often regretted it?  Like many of us in the comment know, none of us ever regret a workout or yoga flow with you!

And the second thing I noticed was that I stopped talking negatively to myself when I was falling backwards or tripping or whatever--instead I started to reframe it as gratitude. Yoga is constantly showing me where my imbalances are, what I need to strengthen, and helping me to actually grow stronger than mind-body neurological connection. This also reminds me of life; that whenever I feel stupid from making a mistake or get humbled, that I am learning and getting stronger. 

My complacency is the cost of growing stronger, and to paraphrase Hemingway: some of us grow stronger from the places that we are broken. You are light teacher that helps us all not only nurture our weaknesses, but celebrate the flowers on our branches. Namaste 🌞🙏💜",UgzuALlUTqSo5-DTcqd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-11-20T09:12:39Z,0.9820622801780701
241.0,"Hey Adriene, I intuitively selected this practice and was enjoying it for 10 minutes until a back injury asked me to do some yin, so I let my body guide me into what yin asanas it needed and flowed with that. I feel great now! Connecting to your practice served exactly as it was meant to. And even the intention of this one, full body awareness, was facilitated.

1. I have more awareness about my posture during the day
2. My heels touch the floor on downward dog, but only after I've done it several times. I guess thats normal
3. I am definately stronger. I also do pole dance for a hobby, and my teacher has noticed that some exercises are getting better, so yay! :D

Today's practise warmed me up very quickly especially with warrior posture. I'm not one for praise but in Adriene's case, I will say that if you're already doing a yoga class in village hall or gym and you want to continue with yoga, Adriene is the first person to come to, she explains each posture and without realising, the session is over because I get into each class straight away and enjoy the session. I love these practises in a morning before work, they really set me up for the day. On different note we brits love to talk about the weather, this morning it's not raining, hurray and the Sun should make an appearance today at some point, Glastonbury starts today and our politicians are still running around like headless chickens.

They really sink in instead of my initial reaction of disregarding or even doubting them. Im starting to feel more open to the world around me with my yoga pratice being a huge part of it.

I am home alone during the days in a little cabin out of the way and have been seeking support, togetherness. and good vibes from others and have found it in my yoga practice and just reading the feedback that is shared on all the videos :) Today I especially noticed some serious changes in my form and flexibility. I have always said I am not a flexible person and throughout this program have been just focusing on the breath and the feeling more so than the perfect shape, low and behold the shape came after! I am stretchy in a way i have never been before and although it seemed to be happening so slowly between yesterday and todays practice is night and day.

I feel sore, but not medicating, my body is getting over it better, I am not feeling like throwing the towel in and quitting or like I am going to die, ""oh honey I need some pain medication help""; that is how I use to behave whinning to my husband at the slightest discomfort.  Yoga and in particular as I have started my journey with you, your words of encouragement and guidance has set me on a righteous path to perform at my optimum best. I was even emboldened to try crow pose at the end of the practice today.  I was as I did in my summer yoga course only able to hold it for about 1 sec, but I did not bolder down to the mat as when I first tried months ago in class.  So funny I was in the back row and a group of us there seem to have the same challenges, like not being able to do any of the poses without tumbling over.  We had a rip-roaring laughing ball!  We were careful not to disturb the teacher or the class, but could n't help it, just falling and trying and laughing our no yoga buts off.   Now I am a bit better and enjoying the journey.  I carry this into my daily dealings and am able to demonstrate emotional intelligence by being patient, not react or overreact, but calmy see situations through and wait for the proper time to take responsible sensible action and breathe and live my life with sanity.  This is what yoga has done for me and of course, we have to make a purposely decision to act accordingly, right.  An abundance of love and thanks, Adriene.  I will share this in inspiration on fwfg.

560.0,"Adriene - I would so love to send you a long personal message (I don't normally write comments on youtube videos but this community seems like the best place) about how wonderful you and your videos are and how it's what's got me doing yoga each day, zinging me into life and love and total joy even when I'm in a massive morning grump. I've even sometimes done two in one day! Your approach is just perfect and so approachable, truly truly you are a wonderful instructor - although I feel that the word 'guide' is more appropriate here.

Anyway - I suffer with various bod issues (pain wise) and I'm happy to say my knees are on the mend (hooraah!) through physio exercises and - yes - I believe the yoga is helping to loosen things up too and help things flow more naturally, thus easing the pain. 

Not easing so much however, are the chronic shoulder knots I have had for the past 11 (since I was 13) and I am currently on strong anti-inflammatories although even as I type having just done this DELICIOUS video my right shoulder is shouting loudly at me - I don't know if you have any recommendations for yoga which maybe strengthens the shoulder, or can help to shift the posture which is definitely at the root of this mahoosive ouchathon? I would be hugely grateful - and will keep on keeping on beginning my day the Adriene way - mindfully and flowingly and gracefully (and graciously). 

Thank you so much, Namaste

I've been really enjoying this 30 day yoga challenge and i'm trying my best to keep up with the exercises as i am fairly new to the practise (i've been practising yoga for only 3-4 months). I have a question. I often experience a popping or clicking sound especially in my knees and lower back (it's more often when i do certain poses such as squatting or trying to bend my back a bit deeper). Is that necesarilly a bad thing or is it just a reaction of the joints? If it's a bad thing can it possibly be my fault?

I feel like we should all meet up together and toast each other with red wine! :)",UggMbgUZaDn8YngCoAEC,0.0,164.0,2015-01-24T16:48:18Z,0.9977167844772339

I never felt, when watching you, like on some cheesy class with instructor, that just wants to have it done or flashing me with plastic fake smiles. You are amazing and kind and you helped me to get healthy from lot of gall bladder problems which I am so grateful for.

574.0,"Hey Adrian! I've been loving this series that you are doing! Seriously feeling the change in my body. But I notice that I have a lot of slippage on my yoga mat. No matter how much I engage my body, it keeps slipping. It's probably because I have a cheap yoga mat I bought years ago from walmart. Can You do a video about qualities to look for in a good yoga mat? I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks! ",UgiDPYa4mjT5qngCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-01-24T03:06:29Z,-0.989865243434906
