Hopefully this was just a hormonal day, because that didn't make me feel good AT ALL. Not putting this here to crap on these videos, because they are wonderful, but just as a way to say to anyone else like me, hey, not everybody can do this easily.

164.0,"Started this, at day one, three days ago, tomorrow day four.

Thus far I‚Äôve found it both difficult and supremely gratifying at different points. 

I‚Äôm going to complete the course due to the following reasons:
1. I‚Äôm 52, only move if necessary, unfit & sick of my inner sloth. Gotta stop behaving like I‚Äôm rooted to comfortable, inanimate objects
2. Today our cat Buddy walked in, whilst I was mid fall and whining about it. Buddy performed a pro yoga moved that sorta looked like an inverted, twisted pretzel, whilst purring, looking me right in the eye, throwing down the gauntlet
3. As I was laid unwinding at the end Buddy climbed on my chest and busted the downward dog with aggravating athleticism. Rude AF
4. Buddy is an arsehole, and I can‚Äôt let him win

Combining these stretches with CBD treatment and a healthy diet has already shown results. In 3 days time, I feel more open and limber, I sleep better, and my cravings for alcohol and cigarettes have dropped significantly. I went from drinking a pint or two of whiskey and smoking a pack of Camels a day to not drinking at all and smoking maybe 5 cigarettes in a day.

Next thing I know, today is Wednesday and I've just now completed day 3. I don't know what happened on Monday and Tuesday (other than Netflix binges). This morning, my husband and I both woke up sandwiched between our two dogs. I had intense neck pain and couldn't wait to start day 3. I'm considering doing day 4 tonight just because it's targeted for your back. Moral of the story; sometimes you have to wake up on the wrong side of the bed and it gives you the motivation to turn the day around.

When you say ""Lift the kneecaps"", do you mean to lift them all the way, and sort of lock the knee? Or is it maybe more the slightest muscular activation? And the patella go somewhere between the lowest and highest point?

However, I have noticed my back aching during and after practice (usually when I sit up straight). I've really noticed how much I ordinarily slouch, especially when sat at my computer, so I am wondering if it's just my back getting used to a new position? I find sitting up straight quite uncomfortable and in time I just naturally slouch down again.

My hip bones are super high,  so I was thinking that maybe that move that you do where you hold your knees and roll your pelvis may actually be the issue.

Thank you very much for your videos.
I'm new to this practice and trying to get into it little by little. Your guidance have been very helpful.
I wanted to share a beginners view of todays practice (and it extends to the two prevuois ones as well) - As I'm a beginner I don't really know what I'm doing, so as far as possible I try to mimic your mouvements. But trying to do so can be difficult at some points because as our bodies are facing each other (me facing video screen) when you move your right limbs I mimic the same with my right ones ^^ And vice versa. I don't think that'svery important for the practice but it makes it difficult at times to follow your mouvement flow because I've to keep thinking which one is right and which one is left.
Maybe when editing your videos, you have a tool to reverse the image. I'm not sure, but it seems that it could make it easier.

I am very stiff, and my body hurts--the back, the knees, etc. I am 23 years old, this shouldn't happen. So I joined the 30 days challenge, and I was wondering if this will also help me lose my belly fat. It is not that I want to be absolutely thin for beauty purposes, but I have digestive problems and hormone problems and whatnot, and I really do need to lose my tummy fat. Any idea if doing 30 days over and over again will help? Or do I need to continue my gym membership? ;-P",UgjD7mADp9TIlngCoAEC,5.0,1.0,2015-09-17T15:04:51Z,-0.9975971579551697

Not only am I doing yoga but I'm committing myself to meditating and reconnecting with friends and family for thirty days. This idea came about and wouldn't you know it, it's also Ramadan tomorrow! My boyfriend is Muslim and it works out that he will be fasting for thirty days and I'll be on my own spiritual journey for 30 days! I'm already on day three but it's the thought that counts!

Keeping a comment diary as I do this program.

DAY 3:

Well, again I'm about three days off the program, should be ind ay six but I barely managed to squeeze in today's workout. Anyway, fresh of the presses, this was my favorite workout so far. And the easiest one for me. Really loved the happy baby pose part, I really need to stratch ""what lies in between"". As for the ""core"" I honestly felt very little in my core, my thighs arms and back all feel great. Didn't feel any ab sensations that you feel with crunches. But it was an awesome work out today. Hope day 4 is just as awesome! Off to the shower now!",UggPIGXam6Sph3gCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2015-02-09T04:02:02Z,0.9986866116523743

When moving from downward dog into putting one leg up for leg circles, I struggle to keep the heel down of my planted food.

¬†As soon as my little bubba is asleep I hit the mat and it's feeling great! ¬†I love having freedom too - when I have done a little of yoga in the past I have been so ridged ¬†so it is nice to be more relaxed, get a workout but at the end really feeling more in tune with my body - it resonates through the whole day and my attitude towards myself - feeling a 'shift' within -- it's great.

I've been meaning to ask, but when you mentioned Yin postures in today's video, I finally remembered. Do you have a Yin video?¬†I know you have some relaxation videos, but if I'm not mistaken the postures aren't held for the length of time traditionally done in Yin. If not, I think it would make a great addition to your wonderful collection of videos. You're one of my favorite online yogis, and I would love to have your unique teaching style guiding me through a delicious Yin session.

I was doing pushups during my workout afterward, and I could hear all the groanings and vibrations of my muscles. I kept thinking someone was opening the garage door or moving something large in the next room until I realized that the sounds correlated perfectly to what my muscles were doing.

I've been on a journey of healing and self-development for a few months, with yoga a core player. I've been doing the yoga challenge since it started a few days ago. So I'm chalking this up to heightened awareness, mostly due to Yoga With Adriene. Thank you, Adriene!

So happy to be doing this challenge with you. This might sound like a crazy idea but if anyone would like, I could record a little video on my channel just as a way to share my progress, you guys could do the same and we could all hang out and support each other and get to know each other?
