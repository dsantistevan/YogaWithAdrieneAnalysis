I somehow pulled through this very deep depression but struggled to find joy in life. Your videos help me so much on this journey of re-discovering myself and the world, I'm taking baby steps to re-learn hope and shed crusty thick layer of cynicism.

I just happened upon the 30 day yoga challenge, well I guess 13 days ago, and it's been great, but today was exactly what I needed. I've been going through a really hard time and the last few days I've wondered how I'm going to make it through the next few days, let alone weeks and months. This practice was the first time I actually realized I was present in my body and when thoughts about everything happening in my life came in, it wasn't with a sense of overwhelming hopelessness, it was with a sense of ""I'll get through it"" and then they floated away, leaving me to focus on what I was doing in the moment. Your daily reminders of the intention of our practice is perfect: My intention for the whole 30 days is intentional self-care and when I find myself getting frustrated about not doing something ""right"" or body image or anything else, I just say that mantra over and over and over again.
