With Yoga Camp, we ask - what is the point of a rigorous workout if you still are waking up in the morning and looking in the mirror and not loving what you see? What is the point of 50 chaturangas if you look in the mirror and don't know who it is you see? Who cares if you have a rocking body if your mental wellness is a hot mess! Can we live a rich and beautiful life if we don't love ourselves?

I am so incredibly inspired by your willingness to ask the big questions, do the work and tend to not just your physical fitness but your mental health as well. I believe this is a way to true self-compassion. Enjoy your practice.
