2,Yoga With Adriene,Revolution - Day 2 - Practice Intention - Yoga With Adriene,"Your Day 2 yoga practice invites you to focus on what it feels like to move with breath and intention. This practice blends yoga philosophy with your workout and continues to lay the foundation for beginners and beginner's mind to grow from. Stay present, listen to your body every step of the way.

When we practice moving with intention on the mat it becomes easier for us to move from a place of connect and move with intention and awareness off the mat. It's all connected baby - so sink your teeth in.

Namaste.

6,Yoga With Adriene,Revolution - Day 6 - Attention (and Abs) Practice,"Your Day 6 practice asks you to befriend your body. Our modern cultures have trained our minds to think of the body in a very distorted way. The language we use to shape the way we think about the body needs to be tended to. So it is with great irony and fun humor that I include ABS into Day 6 routine. It's okay to want that strong pack. (Pass me a cold one?) But pay attention! Pay attention to what actually feels good and move from there. We are no doubt getting stronger. Ripped. But it's only a by-product of the deep relationship we are cultivating with ourselves. Hot prana bodies unite!

Surprise yourself.

Namaste.

PS: I changed the title of this puppy to Attention instead of Awareness so that you could consider what it actually is that you are prioritizing when you take time for yourself. What are you paying attention to first? Your flat tummy? Or the smiling of your amazing, unique, brilliant, and fierce soul?
