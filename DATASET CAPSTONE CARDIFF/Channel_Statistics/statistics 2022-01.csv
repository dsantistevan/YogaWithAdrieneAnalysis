Meet yourself here. 

The hardest part will be getting here. It won’t be any pose or bind. The hardest part will be arriving for your daily practice. So let that be named.

It’s day one, and this practice invites you to come as you are.

We show up as an individual, but together we can make big moves.

Be patient.

Small gestures, make big waves.

The journey starts here, right NOW.

2,Yoga With Adriene,Day 2 - Open  |  MOVE - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"In this session we create open space for new discoveries.
It will require your attention and focus, so start with your breath. 

I don’t have many rules in practice, but one I do have is this:

The breath always comes first.

Your brain and nervous system will be continuously regenerating as you experience the 30 days - gaining new knowledge and feedback. 

Build a new foundation with your breath and you will receive more benefits from your journey.

This is a practice that invites you to not only stretch your body, but to stretch your mind too.

I’ll be guiding quite a bit with my voice in this practice and the coming practices. 

Let go of expectations and enjoy this time to explore.

Remember, the breath comes first.

4,Yoga With Adriene,Day 4 - Flow  |  MOVE - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Rich foundational work continues in our Day 4 Flow session!

While we will get the blood flowing and heart pumping today - this session is an opportunity to check in with the mental and spiritual parts of yourself. 

This is, in fact, what the ancient practice of yoga is all about. 

Today’s session is a loving training for the brain and body. Perfect for those who have flow experience, but even better for those entering with a beginner's mind. Use your breath and the vocabulary we have created thus far to fall into your flow state today.

5,Yoga With Adriene,Day 5 - Deepen  |  MOVE - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"When we take time to deepen the relationship with our subtle body and breath, we are creating a sense of wholeness, of feeling complete, more true. 

This can then lead to us feeling more confident and more capable of loving ourselves. 

And that of course can have a beautiful ripple effect, a movement beyond ourselves. 

So as we begin to add more vocabulary and depth through visualization and imagination remember, 

How you move matters.

Consistency and compassion are key.

Today’s practice is designed to help you embrace your process and journey by slowing down and learning how to rest. 

Wear something extra comfy if you can. Grab a blanket, maybe a pillow too. 

*If you don’t have any of these things handy and you are just squeezing this in, no worries. The important thing is that you show up for practice.

This is vital in the home practice, and extremely beneficial not only for how you move throughout life but to set yourself up with a daily practice you can sustain and grow. 

While we have been working on core stability and hip stability, in order to balance the flexibility you are no doubt already exploring/seeking - today’s session is all about neurological control and strength.

We are talking range of motion, joint health, decreasing injury, and increasing tissue health. We are talking integrity.

How well can you actively move yourself?

12,Yoga With Adriene,Day 12 - Focus  |  MOVE - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Today’s session highlights the importance of focus in yoga, as well as the myriad of ways in which daily practice can support your mental concentration and productivity. 

***Yoga is a discipline*** 

Focus is a practice. 

And the focused gaze has rich meaning both on and off the mat.

This session is not about crocodile breaths, creative squats, or eagle pose. 
It is about our willingness to learn how to focus our attention with awareness.

You are not alone. There are many others putting this powerful puzzle together with you.

We ease into this practice with some lovely floor work to stretch, support a healthy spine, and encourage you on your journey to build core strength that sticks around all year.

Just like all of these practices, we are showing up to improve function in both the brain and body. Use the breath to accentuate your experience as we explore half-moon, standing splits, crow pose and more.

When we create safe, healthy spaces for us to make it about ourselves and listen and check-in, then it has an incredible ripple effect on how we show up for others.

Your practice is about you. And it’s OKAY to make it about you.

We have made it to day 20. Whether you did it in 20 days or more, there are ten more practices left in this series. And the last ten days are my absolute favorite.

Today we are embracing and celebrating the intention behind showing up and the intention behind your movement, and how powerful that can be. 

A little goes a long way, don’t forget.

Follow the sound of your breath and nurture your brain and body. The next ten days are really about embracing the ritual of the at-home practice.

What makes it a ritual?

23,Yoga With Adriene,Day 23 - Soften  |  MOVE - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"As you may notice, by Day 23, I start to have a little more fun in my leadership here.
I hope you take it as a great reminder that this is a training designed to improve your quality of life. I find softness in yoga is a discipline. It at times feels almost like a lost art form in popular western asana.

25,Yoga With Adriene,Day 25 - Release  |  MOVE - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Through daily yoga and breath practice, we develop a deeper awareness of where we are holding tension and trauma. No doubt you have at least once walked off the mat feeling as though you were carrying less stress than when you stepped on.
This session utilizes movement and breath technique to highlight the powerful ways in which we can use the practice of mindful awareness to lovingly and safely tend to what triggers.

We are in the home stretch of this journey. Lean in. Let go of that which no longer serves. I got your back.

28,Yoga With Adriene,Day 28 - TLC  |  MOVE - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"Today’s session provides a little tender loving care, a little TLC, for your brain, your body and your heart. Yoga works. I have built this practice to equip you with the tools to feel empowered in the many moons of your life. Daily practice isn’t always about maximizing. It is about meeting yourself where you are. Ask, how am I feeling?*** And then ask… How do I want to feel?***  The way you respond to this question with breath and through movement is what this journey is all about.

Two more days and then we will engage in our final MOVE session together, which will signify something special.

Heads up, tomorrow will be our last day of guided sessions as you know them thus far - we have a purposeful surprise awaiting us on Day 30!

Stay open. 
Show up.

If you are already wondering what will happen after the 30 days is complete, don’t worry, I have us covered.

My loving advice for you today is to think about your yoga practice as a training for how you want to move through your life. I hope you have felt a sense of belonging on this journey. It is the foundation for the offering, and where I build from. Trust, this experience is meant to be.

If you are ever in a tight spot, at a crossroads, or unsure how or where to move next…
Find your breath. 

HEAR IT. 
Trust it.
Trust your awareness.
Your gut.

Heads up, we have a purposeful surprise awaiting tomorrow for Day 30! Today’s session is a perfect set up. Do you trust me?

30,Yoga With Adriene,Day 30 - Choose  |  MOVE - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,"In our day thirty tradition, I am taking off the mic and inviting you to practice alongside me, and thousands of others in the same moment. What does that mean? It means, you won’t follow my verbal instruction today, nor should you feel the need to match my moves. 

You are the leader today. I am your friend practicing at my own pace alongside. 

This session is different - and yet,  in my mind, the perfect way to seal our journey.

Use the vocabulary you have to create stability and softness. Listen to your breath for cues on when and how to uplift, snuggle, savor, and explore. Cultivate love and courage with curiosity and focus.

The goal of this session is not for our practice to match - but for us to celebrate our connectedness through our individuality and truth. 


This is the last session of our journey, choose how you want to feel. 

Rest when you like, breathe like you love yourself, and trust me, trust yourself, trust the process, trust it all. In every end is a new beginning.
Allow yourself to be moved.
Trust me. You have everything you need. 

Thank you so much for showing up and sharing this journey with me.
